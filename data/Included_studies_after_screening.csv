ACTA AMAZONICA,Stem growth of multipurpose tree species: net effect of micrometeorological variability assessed by principal component regression,"In a typical year in the central Amazon, there is a mild dry season, but its effect on stem growth of multipurpose forest tree species is not yet well known. This study aimed to determine the individual effect of microclimatic parameters on stem growth after removing the influence of intercorrelation among microclimatic variables. Monthly stem diameter increment was measured in six species (46 trees) from January 2018 to December 2020. Microclimatic variables recorded were irradiance, air temperature, rainfall, and vapor pressure deficit. Principal component regression was used to assess the effect of micrometeorological variability on stem growth. On average, stem growth increased with an increase in rainfall and soil water content, but decreased with rise in maximum temperature and maximum vapor pressure deficit. These findings indicate that, when removing the effect of intercorrelation between microclimatic parameters, vapor pressure deficit may, in fact, affect stem growth. We demonstrate that the reduction in stem growth during the dry season can also be related to an increase in maximum temperature and maximum vapor pressure deficit, and not only to a decline in soil water content.",Amazon rainforest; growth; ecophysiology; soil water availability,2022,52,4,10.1590/1809-4392202103390,0044-5967,16,130,182,1206,4,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
ACTA AMAZONICA,Genetic diversity in creole genotypes of Amazon chicory,"Amazon chicory is still a little-known vegetable despite its great agronomic potential. The characterization of chicory genotypes concerning genetic divergence is a key step for breeding programs, as it allows the selection of superior individuals and to explore the variability and complementarity of characteristics via interbreeding between newly generated genotypes. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the genetic divergence among Amazon chicory creole genotypes from the northern Brazilian states of Para and Rondonia based on morpho-agronomic traits. We conducted an experiment in a randomized block design with eight chicory genotypes (treatments) and four replications. Both quantitative and qualitative characteristics were evaluated. Genetic divergence was estimated via squared generalized Mahalanobis distance (D-2), considering only quantitative characters, and the genotypes were subsequently clustered via the UPGMA method. Analysis of variance showed significant differences among genotypes for all studied characteristics, except shoot fresh weight. The UPGMA grouped the genotypes into three clusters, which demonstrated that the genotypes from Colares and Santarem Novo (Para) (Chic-02 and Chic-04) were the most divergent as compared to the genotypes from Castanhal and Santa Isabel do Para (Para). Qualitative characteristics showed a monomorphic behavior and, therefore, were not used to assess genetic divergences. To obtain segregating populations with complementary characteristics, crossbreeding between the two most divergent clusters is recommended.",Eryngium foetidum; non-conventional food plants; genetic variability; plant breeding,2022,52,2,10.1590/1809-4392202102852,0044-5967,8,55,213,1588,4,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
ACTA AMAZONICA,Nutrient requirements of parica (Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum): optimizing seedling quality for reforestation programs,"Amazonian reforestation programs emphasize the use of species native to the region. However, reforestation using native species requires the production of high-quality seedlings. The present study aimed to evaluate the development and quality of seedlings of parica (Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum), a species native to the Amazon with high potential for reforestation activities. We carried out a greenhouse experiment in which seedlings were subjected to treatments with varying presence of major and micronutrients in the substrate, and evaluated the effect on functional attributes (plant height, stem diameter, specific leaf area, shoot and root dry matter) and physiological response (chlorophyll a, b and carotenoid concentrations). Our results showed that nutrient omission significantly affects parica seedling growth. Considering the assessed biometric and physiological variables, the highest nutritional requirements of seedlings were for N, P, K, micronutrients, Mg and S, while seedling quality was maintained in the absence of Ca. Overall, this species shows efficient use of available nutrients and potential for growth in soils with low concentrations of bases. Therefore, for the production of high-quality parica seedlings, major and micronutrients should be added and lime is essential, but the good seedling performance under Ca omission suggested that this element does not need to be added to the soil.",soil fertility; Amazonian species; deficiency symptoms; nutrient omission; biometric variables,2022,52,2,10.1590/1809-4392202101251,0044-5967,14,127,206,1432,5,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
ACTA AMAZONICA,"Evaluation of fisheries management strategies using a biotic integrity index in floodplain lakes in the lower Solimoes River, Amazonas, Brazil","Fisheries is an important activity in the Amazon basin and potentially has a high impact on ichthyofauna. With the aim of achieving sustainability in fisheries of target species, protected areas were established within a fisheries management framework known as the Amazon Lakes Management System (ALMS). With the aim to evaluate the effect of ALMS on fish assemblages as a whole, we compared floodplain lakes with different levels of fish management in the lower Solim??es River, in the Brazilian Amazon, developing an index of biotic integrity, named ALMS-IBI. We sampled fish in three lake categories: protected (PR), managed (MN), and commercially fished (CM). The ALMS-IBI was developed by selecting and testing fish assemblage metrics based on samplings carried out in 2017 and 2018, using gillnets with different mesh sizes. We captured 4565 fish of 113 species and seven trophic categories. The final index is composed of seven metrics related to species richness, trophic structure, and fish abundance, and characterized the fish assemblage in the PR and MN lakes as acceptable, and in the CM lakes as poor. Our results indicate that the ALMS-IBI can be an efficient method to monitor the whole fish assemblage in Amazonian floodplain lakes, and can be used as a complementary tool in the ALMS to assess environmental sustainability.",environmental quality; multimetric index; bioindicators; Amazon basin,2022,52,4,10.1590/1809-4392202201461,0044-5967,20,142,212,1341,4,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
ACTA AMAZONICA,Phytotechnical performance and resistance to leaf- footed bugs of green maize intercropped with Poaceae in the Amazon savannah,"Green maize has great economic value, and the consumer market increasingly demands the production of ears for fresh consumption that are free from damage by pest attacks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of varieties of AG1051 green maize and Roraima maize (ethnovariety Milh??o) intercropped with dwarf grain sorghum, forage sorghum and millet in an environment of the Amazon savannah. We evaluated phytotechnical characteristics of the maize and damage from the leaf-footed bug (Leptoglossus zonatus). The experiment was set up in a 2 x 4 factorial randomised block design with four replications, where the two maize varieties corresponded to the first factor and four intercropping systems to the second factor. Regarding vegetative and reproductive components, Milh??o had a longer cycle, greater plant growth and smaller stem diameter than AG1051, causing plant lodging. The intercropping systems had no influence on the production or quality of maize ears for any of the cultivars under study. Milh??o did not differ from the AG1051 hybrid in any ear quality variable (ear length, number of grains per ear, cob diameter, ear weight and total number of ears). The AG1051 cultivar was preferred by L. zonatus, but had the highest yield of commercial ears. The intercropping systems had no influence on the damage caused by the leaf-footed bug.",Leptoglossus zonatus; Pennisetum glaucum; Sorghum bicolor; trap plants; Zea mays,2022,52,4,10.1590/1809-4392202102960,0044-5967,18,126,216,1368,5,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
ACTA AMAZONICA,Soil phosphorus fractions and their relation to leaf litterfall in a central Amazonian terra firme rainforest,"Phosphorus (P) cycling is an important yet poorly studied aspect of the macronutrient balance in tropical rainforest ecosystems. As soil P occurs in different organic and inorganic forms (fractions) with varying degrees of lability, we hypothesized that these fractions will vary between soil types, and temporally within soil types. Additionally, we hypothesized a direct influence of leaf litterfall P input on soil total P and soil P fractions. We collected soil and leaf litter samples from three soil types in a central Amazonian lowland rainforest in Brazil over five months, and used a modified Hedleys fractionation method to determine six organic and inorganic soil P fractions, and also total, labile and residual P. Leaf litterfall P concentrations were determined colorimetrically. Soil inorganic and organic P fractions varied between soil types and across months, but soil type and month interactions were mostly non-significant. Some inorganic P fractions (P-i-NaOH) peaked while the organic fractions (P-o-NaOH) fell and vice versa. Leaf litterfall production and leaf litterfall P input peaked around two months following the wettest month. Leaf litterfall P input was a significant predictor of P-o-NaHCO3, a bioavailable P fraction. Future studies on P cycling in terrestrial ecosystems should examine the roles played by individual soil P fractions as they cycle asynchronistically and differently across soil types.",nutrient cycling; leaf litter; tropical soil,2022,52,2,10.1590/1809-4392202103471,0044-5967,16,109,214,1436,3,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
ACTA AMAZONICA,Ecological aspects of Rhinoclemmys punctularia punctularia (Testudines: Geoemydidae) in two localities in northern Brazil,"Rhinoclemmys punctularia punctularia is the only turtle of the family Geoemydidae with part of its range in Brazil. The species is semi-aquatic and widely distributed across the Amazon basin but is still poorly studied. We evaluated aspects of the population structure, habitat use, seasonal activity, and diet of the species during one year, from the beginning of the rainy season to the end of the dry season, in two headwater localities in the Tocantins and Tapaj??s river basins, in the state of Par??, Brazil. We captured 45 individuals, 14 in the Tocantins basin and 31 in the Tapaj??s basin. The size-class frequency distributions of captured individuals did not differ between the two samples. The turtles were most frequently captured in first-order streams, followed by lentic (third-order dammed streams) and second-order streams. The capture rate did not vary significantly between sampling periods (start and peak of the rainy season; start and end of the dry season). The trapping effort to capture a single individual was much higher in the Tapaj??s basin (1,215 trap-hours) than in the Tocantins basin (136 trap-hours). Overall, the low capture rates confirm the secretive nature of the species in Amazonia and its apparent rarity.

ACTA AMAZONICA,Resistance of acetylated Jacaranda copaia wood to termites and decaying fungi attack,"The natural durability of the wood is essential for the definition of its use, and this property can be enhanced with the proper chemical treatment of the wood. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the resistance to termites and decay fungi of Jacaranda copaia wood chemically modified through acetylation. Five experimental treatments were assessed: acetylation for 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours and a control (non-acetylated). The acetylation was carried out by immersing wood samples in acetic anhydride at 90 degrees C. Acetylated and control samples were subjected to the action of xylophagous termites (Nasutitermes sp.) and decaying fungi (Gloeophyllum trabeum and Trametes versicolor). The acetylation process significantly increased the resistance of Jacaranda copaia wood to the attack of the xylophagous organisms. There was no mass loss after exposure to termites of the wood in any of the acetylation treatments, while in the control wood, mass loss was 9.5\%. Regarding the decaying fungi, mass loss occurred in all treatments. Acetylation for 6 and 8 hours were the most efficient chemical treatments, increasing the resistance dass of the Jacaranda copaia wood to highly resistant.",biodeterioration; xylophagous organisms; Nasutitermes; Gloeophyllum trabeum; Trametes versicolor,2022,52,3,10.1590/1809-4392202200832,0044-5967,12,84,186,1200,5,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
ACTA AMAZONICA,Copaiba oleoresin presents anti-obesogenic effect and mitigates inflammation and redox imbalance in adipose tissue,"Obesogenic diets lead to fat accumulation and dysfunctional adipose tissue. Active compounds were described in copaiba oleoresin, which presents anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. However, there are no data regarding the effects of copaiba oleoresin in adipose tissue. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the copaiba oleoresin could prevent or minimize obesity and adipose tissue inflammation and oxidative stress in response to a high sucrose diet. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receiving commercial chow (C, n = 8), commercial chow and 30\% sucrose added to the drinking water (S, n = 8), or commercial chow and 30\% sucrose added to the drinking water + copaiba oleoresin (S+CO, n = 8). Copaiba oleoresin was given at a dose of 200 mg kg(-1) day(-1) by gavage for eight weeks. C and S animals received vehicle, at equivalent volume, by gavage. At the end of the experiment, blood samples and epididymal adipose tissue were collected for biochemical, inflammatory, and oxidative stress analyses. Copaiba oleoresin supplementation prevented weight gain, adiposity, insulin resistance, and increased IL-1 beta levels. Additionally, copaiba oleoresin partially attenuated the increase in fasting glucose levels, lipids, and IL-6 levels, and improved the redox status in adipose tissue. Our results suggest that the use of copaiba oleoresin could be a good strategy for prevention of obesity and its complications.",natural products; high sucrose diet; obesity; Copaifera,2022,52,4,10.1590/1809-4392202201411,0044-5967,14,114,219,1457,4,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
ACTA AMAZONICA,Insecticidal activity of Piper aduncum oil: variation in dillapiole content and chemical and toxicological stability during storage,"The insecticidal effect of the essential oil of Piper aduncum (EOPA), and of its constituent dillapiole [}1-allyl-2,3-dimethoxy-4,5-(methylenedioxy) benzene] in particular, is well documented in the literature and can be associated with its interference with the enzymatic detoxification in arthropods. However, no data exist on the range of dillapiole content associated with insecticidal activity, which is necessary to establish reliable dose-activity parameters for a formulated product. The oil composition can also change during storage after distillation, mainly due to environmental factors such as light incidence, atmospheric oxygen and temperature, which can be deleterious to oil quality. In this study, EOPA subjected to different storage conditions over four years and its rectified fractions were submitted to bioassays to evaluate their insecticidal effect by topical contact and residual contact against Spodoptera frugiperda. Our objectives were to determine the relationship between dillapiole content and the insecticidal activity of EOPA, and to evaluate its chemical and toxicological properties over time under different conditions. Our results showed that EOPA was stable with respect to the dillapiole content and the toxicological effect against S. frugiperda under different storage conditions for four years. The overall chemical composition of the EOPA did not vary significantly among storage conditions. EOPA with dillapiole content ranging between 68\% and 100\% showed greater insecticidal toxicity by residual and topical contact against S. frugiperda larvae.","chemical and toxicological stability; arylpropanoids; botanical insecticides; terpenoid storage; 1-allyl-2,3-dimethoxy-4,5-(methylenedioxy) benzene",2022,52,3,10.1590/1809-4392202102292,0044-5967,17,131,221,1593,5,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
ACTA AMAZONICA,Caryocar villosum attenuates inflammation by inhibiting CXCL1 activation and peripheral hyperalgesia through opioid pathway modulation,"The oil of Caryocar villosum is used in Amazonian folk medicine to treat pain and inflammatory conditions. So, we assessed the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties of the ethanolic extract obtained from the fruit peels of this species. The acetic acid-induced writhing, carrageenan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, formalin, carrageenan-induced paw edema and carrageenan-induced peritonitis tests were used on mice. The C. villosum ethanolic extract significantly inhibited the number of abdominal writhes, mechanical hyperalgesia and paw licking time in the second phase of the formalin test. At a dose of 300 mg kg(-1), the extract also significantly reduced the volume of edema formed in the late phase and reduced the recruitment of leukocytes and neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity, as well as CXCL1 chemokine levels. It is suggested that the extract attenuates the leukocyte recruitment by inhibiting the CXCL1 activation. The peripheral antinociceptive activity occured through opioid pathway modulation because pretreatment with C. villosum ethanolic extract reversed the naltrexone-induced antinociception.",pain; antinociception; chemokine; leukocyte recruitment,2022,52,3,10.1590/1809-4392202200552,0044-5967,15,134,156,1129,4,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes

Micro-histological analysis of the stomach contents of rodents collected from various habitats was carried out. In the diet of Mastomys natalensis, Lemniscomys rosalia and Mus triton, seed/grain showed greater importance (>35\%, >55\% and 60\% respectively), whereas for Lophuromys kilonzoi, plant materials were more important (>55\%) than other categories. Seed/grains were more important (>20\%) in the diet of Praomys delectorum, while plant materials were more important (>45\%) in the diet of forest-dwelling L. kilonzoi. Food diversity for rodents in farmland was relatively low compared with forest-dwelling rodents. Our results indicated that the relatively low niche breadth observed in rodents caught in farms could be attributed to the major contribution of seed/grains to their diet while forest-dwelling rodents showed greater food diversity owing to the more heterogeneous and stable nature of forests compared with farms.

Field surveys were conducted at many locations in Egypt between January 2017 and March 2020. From each location, GPS coordinates were taken and the number of individuals was estimated. Also, specimens and seed samples for each species were collected from different habitats as can as possible. Other data were collected through herbaria visits and existing literature. The recorded taxa were arranged alphabetically according to Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system (APG IV). Evaluation of conservation status was based on IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. In the present study, we applied Criterion B that concerns the geographical range in the form of both B1 (extent of occurrence: EOO) and B2 (area of occupancy: AOO). Calculations of both AOO and EOO and the assessment process were assisted using the GeoCAT software. Fifty-seven taxa were recorded, and most of them occur in Elbanian sector. Among them, five alien species were recorded. Many taxa offered economic goods such as medicinal, timber and fuel values; and environmental services as shaders and phytoremediators. Fifty taxa suffered from over-collecting and over-cutting. Among the 52 native trees in the present study, 31 taxa are evaluated as threatened with extinction; 10 taxa are Critically Endangered, 16 are Endangered and 5 are Vulnerable.

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE AND FORAGE SCIENCE,Bromatological and histological features of native African grasses under grazing in Brazilian semi-arid rangelands,"This study evaluated the bromatological and histological features of native African grasses under grazing in Brazilian semi-arid rangelands. An experimental grid design was used in a randomised sampling method for four replicate samples of three African grasses. The grasses evaluated were: Cenchrus ciliaris L., Digitaria pentzii Stent. and Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.). The bromatological and histological traits analysed included dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre corrected to ashes and protein (NDFap), lignin, mesophyll, vascular bundle, phloem, xylem, vascular sheath, sclerenchyma, bulliform cells, and the adaxial and abaxial epidermis. The type of grass and grazing cycle correlated with DM, NDF and lignin (p < 0.05), whereas CP was not affected by these factors (p > 0.05). Dry matter ranged between 128 and 304 g kg(-1); CP ranged between 90 and 167 g kg(-1); NDFap between 542 and 707 g kg(-1), and lignin between 10 and 40 g kg(-1).

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE AND FORAGE SCIENCE,Participatory inventory and nutritional evaluation of local forage resources for smallholder free-range beef production in semi-arid areas of South Africa,"Feed scarcity is a major challenge facing free-range beef farming in semi-arid areas. Specifically, low quality and quantity of forage in rangelands and higher feeding costs are the main constraints limiting smallholder free-range beef farmers' participation in mainstream beef markets. Using farmers' participatory approaches, this study identified major locally available forage resources (LAFRs) and evaluated their nutritional value. A total of 40 free-ranging commercially orientated smallholder beef farmers were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires and tasked to identify LAFRs in the Cradock and Middelburg areas of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Chemical analysis was conducted for the most cited forages such as African sheepbush (Pentzia incana), sweet thorn (Vachellia karroo) leaves and pods, reed (Phragmites australis), lucerne (Medicago sativa) hay, natural pasture grasses (NPGs) and barbary fig, or prickly pear cactus, (Opuntia ficus-indica) cladodes collected from twelve participants' farms. Feed shortage was ranked by more than 53\% respondents as the main constraint to smallholder beef production. Regardless of the farming area, crude protein content of V. karroo leaves and pods averaging 18.8 and 19.5\%, respectively, was higher than other LAFRs. However, V. karoo pods had relatively low ash content than other forages in both farming areas. Opuntia ficus-indica attained high in vitro neutral detergent fibre digestibility at 12, 24 and 48 hr incubation periods, due to low neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and acid detergent lignin. Integration of participatory inventory and chemical analysis proved to be reliable in identifying LAFRs, with V. karroo leaves and O. ficus-indica cladodes being the main potential forage resources for inclusion in beef cattle diets. Further research is recommended to substantiate their supplementary nutritive value and level of inclusion in beef cattle finishing diets.",chemical composition; forage resources; free-range beef farming; in-vitro NDF digestibility; participatory approaches,2023,40,"1, SI",10.2989/10220119.2022.2121941,1022-0119,20,154,279,1963,5,NA,200,5,No,225,175,yes,no,yes

DC. (Asteraceae) were carried out in grasslands with xeric and hydric soils, at sites in Gauteng, South Africa, from 2005 to 2008. The rust fungus Puccinia eupatorii Dietel, an established self-perpetuating biocontrol agent on C. macrocephalum, caused significant damage to shoots in late summer and autumn. Herbicide efficacy was significantly better on foliage that did not already present symptoms and that was sprayed in early summer compared with on infected plants treated in autumn, at both the xeric (F = 36.71, p < 0.001) and hydric (F = 3.59, p = 0.031) sites.

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE AND FORAGE SCIENCE,Historic changes in the fire-rainfall relationship at a woodland-savanna transition zone in southern Africa,"Southern Africa is dominated by fire-prone arid and semi-arid landscapes that are expected to experience increased maximum temperatures, rainfall variation and frequency of extreme rainfall events in the future. These conditions will affect fire and vegetation dynamics, but feedback and interactions among fire, rainfall and woody cover limit our ability to predict future ecosystem changes. Moreover, human activities can also drive changes in these components and their interactions. There are few long-term datasets available to monitor these changes over ecologically relevant time-scales. Here the combined analysis of a rainfall proxy, developed from a baobab tree core (Adansonia digitata) and fire proxy, from a sediment core, in the savanna-woodland transition zone in South Central Africa elucidates the history of two major drivers of savanna structure for the past 600 years.

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,African large carnivore population changes in response to a drought,"African lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) play key roles in savanna ecosystems. Habitat change, overharvesting and retaliatory killing may threaten the persistence of some populations. Climate may cause further disturbance that accentuate negative effects. Droughts weaken the ability of prey to avoid predators resulting in larger carnivore populations. We thus expected populations of African lions and spotted hyaenas to increase during a drought in Kruger National Park (Kruger). Prey that is easier to hunt during droughts may also influence age and sex structures through impacts on survival and fecundity schedules. We tested these predictions by collating information from previous studies and conducting a field call-up survey in Kruger. A severe drought in Kruger during the summer of 2015/2016 allowed pre- and post-drought comparisons. Before the drought, lion and spotted hyaena numbers increased in response to increasing prey biomass. During the drought, lions maintained their numbers, while spotted hyaena numbers increased further. There were substantially more subadult male lions after than before the drought. The abundant subadult males may induce higher incidences of human-carnivore conflict through more dispersing males in future.

The study sought to determine the demand for ecotourism products in view of developing a diversification strategy. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect demand-side data at Maun and Kasane airports; these data were then analysed quantitatively. Findings revealed a strong preference for wildlife/wilderness and nature products, whereas events and hunting were least liked. The country attracts mature tourists who prefer soft adventure and activities that prioritize conservation, interpretation, and environmental education. Factors related to entertainment, the construction of entertainment facilities, a post office, and golf courses were strongly resented. It was established that related diversification, focused on expanding services and enhancing existing products, is the most appropriate strategy. Practically, the research offers a specific diversification strategy based on ecotourism, detailing how and what to diversify.

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,African wild dog movement ecology in a small protected area in South Africa,"Dramatic population declines of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) led to a managed metapopulation approach for wild dog conservation in South Africa. Monitoring the survival and habitat use of packs reintroduced into protected areas (PAs) is an essential part of adaptive management and improving the health and, ultimately, the survival of the metapopulation. Our study describes the territoriality and habitat selection of a pack of wild dogs reintroduced into Manyoni Private Game Reserve (219 km(2)) in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Despite being introduced into a small PA, the pack only utilized half their available space (121 km(2)) and avoided the central areas of the reserve. Post hoc analysis of African lion (Panthera leo) localities suggested competitive avoidance was a strong factor in shaping the habitat usage of the pack; however, further research is required. Habitat selection also varied seasonally and with denning. Ultimately, we showed that spatio-temporal analyses can help identify high-risk areas within wild dog territories, such as hotspots of activity along fencelines. These analyses can then be used to increase targeted management of these areas, such as improving the maintenance of well-used fencelines, which is an important consideration for the sustained success of the metapopulation across small PAs.",African wild dogs; metapopulation; territory; T-LoCoH; habitat selection; competitive avoidance,2021,51,1,10.3957/056.051.0054,2410-7220,13,75,200,1349,6,12,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"An online survey of community perceptions of mammalian mesocarnivores across a land-use gradient in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","Globally, anthropogenic land conversion has resulted in reduced natural land available for free-roaming wildlife, and a shift in species composition. Certain mesocarnivores exhibit an ability to adapt and expand distribution ranges under differing anthropogenic pressures. Our study addressed the socio-ecological attitudes and general perspectives towards mammalian mesocarnivores across a land-use gradient (rural-urban) from the uMgungundlovu to eThekwini municipalities of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We determined threats, conflicts and attitudes towards mammalian mesocarnivores using an online questionnaire survey. The public held a range of opinions on mesocarnivores. Participants from both land-use types generally regarded mesocarnivores as non-threatening and vital for the environment. However, not all mesocarnivores were regarded with equal benevolence. Black-backed jackals, Canis mesomelas, were consistently singled out as a problematic species by rural inhabitants and this intensified reactions when a confrontation occurred. Smaller and more behaviourally flexible mesocarnivores (mongoose spp. and Cape genets, Genetta tigrina) were the most observed species in both land-use types, indicating potential population increases. Vehicle collision was the leading cause of mesocarnivore fatalities. Overall, perceived impacts and threats of mesocarnivores differed across the land-use gradients.

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Assessing the performance of oribi antelope populations at multiple scales: the limitations of citizen-led oribi conservation,"Effective monitoring programmes are critical to understand and mitigate declining wildlife populations. In South Africa, the majority of oribi antelope (Ourebia ourebi ourebi) occur on private rangelands as broadly distributed and highly-fragmented populations. Thus, to effectively manage such a species, conservation organizations rely on citizen science-led conservation initiatives, whereby members of the public provide data on oribi population demographics and potential threats. Using these data, we estimated the total oribi population size and assessed the population trend of oribi in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, over a 14-year period (2001-2014). We found that the oribi population has declined by 30\% over the 14 years. However, oribi population estimates were highly correlated with the number of returned survey forms. This relationship makes it difficult to accurately assess population trends and almost impossible to determine if any changes in conservation management have influenced oribi populations. Thus, issues associated with citizen science and data quality (i.e. participation levels), may limit the ability of the oribi census to accurately inform oribi conservation and management. We discuss the value and limitations of citizen science in oribi conservation with the ultimate goal of improving citizen-led oribi conservation.",census; citizen science; monitoring; population growth; wildlife surveys,2021,51,1,10.3957/056.051.0127,2410-7220,16,125,189,1357,5,12,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Emerging human-carnivore conflict following large carnivore reintroductions highlights the need to lift baselines,"Human-wildlife conflicts may be unintended consequences of conservation successes and rewilding, and could be exacerbated where baselines around biodiversity have shifted. Mediating conflict is a conservation priority both due to its socio-economic impacts and due to consequences that negative perceptions of wildlife have for conservation outcomes. We document locally novel emergent conflict following reintroductions of large carnivores to fenced reserves in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Interviews with managers of 13 reserves (reintroduction sites) and adjacent properties show that reintroduced carnivores escaped from eight reserves (61.5\%) and were recorded on 25 neighbouring properties (36.7\%). Since large carnivore reintroductions to the Eastern Cape Province began in 1996, 75 associated conflict events were reported to the authors. This conflict was not evenly distributed, spatially or economically. Effective, evidence-based mitigation strategies are needed to ensure the continued success of conservation actions. Neighbours and policymakers should be primed for such lifted baselines where predator numbers and/or densities reflect what was historically observed. These conflicts should be anticipated and included in the early planning phases of reintroduction adaptive management processes. Conflict mitigation strategies for reintroductions should include lifting baselines to manage perceptions around recovering wildlife populations or face the prospects of re-extirpation associated with conflict-motivated retaliation.",rewilding; translocation; reintroduction; human-wildlife conflict; shifted baselines; lifted baselines,2021,51,1,10.3957/056.051.0136,2410-7220,13,113,202,1559,6,12,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"Feeding ecology of the large carnivore guild in Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa","Southern Africa has a diverse large carnivore guild. When this large carnivore guild is confined to fenced protected areas, the degree of intraguild competition may increase. Dietary overlap is a notable point of competition and can have considerable effects on lower trophic levels. We considered the prey preferences, dietary overlap, and dietary niche breadth of the large carnivore guild in Madikwe Game Reserve through direct observations and scat analysis, over one year of sampling. These data were analysed using the Jacobs' index for prey preference, the Pianka's index for dietary overlap and Levin's index for dietary niche breadth. Leopards (Panthera pardus), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) had a high degree of dietary overlap and were specialized in their diet selection. Lions (Panthera leo), brown (Parahyaena brunnea) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) also showed a high degree of dietary overlap and had broad diets. Our results show similarities to those of open systems, suggesting that large carnivore diet selection may not be negatively affected when they are confined by fences.

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations as an indicator of stress in blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus),"In South Africa, blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) are routinely captured for relocation purposes. To monitor the stress caused by this practise, a non-invasive method assessing adrenocortical function as a measure of stress would minimize disturbance during sample collection. In our study, an adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge, and a mass-capture event were used to examine the suitability of five enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for monitoring stress-related physiological responses using faeces as a sample matrix. The tested 11-oxoaetiocholanolone I EIA performed best, showing a 2126\% increase above baseline after 22 h for a male, and a 474\% increase for a female 23 h post-ACTH injection. Baseline faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations did not differ between animals captured on either day 1 or day 2 of the capture event, indicating that the frequent presence of a helicopter during the two days did not influence fGCM concentrations. However, during capture-related restraint for up to 10 h, an overall 1.5-fold elevation in (fGCM) concentrations was found. Storage of faeces at ambient temperature post-defecation indicated a fair stability of fGCMs for up to 8 h. The ability to reliably assess adrenocortical function provides a solid basis to examine endocrine responses to putative stressful circumstances in blue wildebeest.",capture; faecal glucocorticoid metabolites; ACTH challenge test; fGCM stability post-defecation,2021,51,1,10.3957/056.051.0090,2410-7220,15,126,199,1364,4,12,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

To investigate individually-specific responses of nyala antelopes (Tragelaphus angasii) to vegetation greenness, we monitored the landscape use of eight telemetry-collared adult females, half at the wetter end and half at the drier end of Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa. We used remotely-sensed greenness as an index for plant productivity and data on canopy structure, and we compared the strength of selection for greenness between animals having different greenness averages within their home ranges. We found a decreasing pattern between home-range average greenness and strength of selection, which depended on season and presence of tree canopies. Animals in low-greenness home ranges tended to have stronger positive selection in closed-canopy vegetation in the dry season; those in high-greenness home ranges tended to have the stronger negative selection in open-canopy vegetation in the wet season.

Many hobbyist UAVs have been applied to ecological studies, but proprietary software limits their widespread application with little quantification with regards to their accuracy and efficiency in the creation of maps through photogrammetry. Our study addressed these concerns by evaluating a combination of an entry-level UAV and open-source photogrammetry drone mapping software as a low-budget mapping solution for ecologists. Geometrically accurate orthophotograph maps were created from flights at altitudes below 70 m with and without differential global positioning system (d-GPS) ground control points. Object measurement errors were constrained below 30 mm for altitudes up to 70 m, and errors fell below 10 mm at 30 m altitudes with d-GPS points and below 20 mm without the use of d-GPS ground control points. Our analyses provide guidelines that parameterize the requirements for the mapping of smaller areas.

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,The determinants of mesocarnivore activity patterns in highveld grassland and riparian habitats,"Despite the diversity of mesocarnivores and the broad geographic ranges of these species, our understanding of their behaviour and ecology at multi-species and community levels is limited. Our study was conducted between April and mid-July 2015 and used data collected over 105 days from 39 camera traps to quantify activity patterns of sympatric mesocarnivores in riparian and grassland habitats of Telperion Nature Reserve, South Africa. A total of 13 mesocarnivore species were detected within this relatively small (similar to 7350 ha) reserve. Sufficient records (>= 10 records) were obtained for rusty-spotted genet (Genetta maculata), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas), otter species (African clawless otter, Aonyx capensis, and spotted-necked otter, Hydrictis maculicollis), serval (Leptailurus serval), slender mongoose (Galerella sanguinea), yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) and marsh mongoose (Atilax paludinosus). Generalized linear models were used to investigate whether species ID, temperature, vegetation characteristics or moon phase best predicted temporal activity. To assess which species had the highest potential for competitive interaction, we also quantified the coefficient of activity overlap. Our results show that species ID and temperature were the best predictors of mesocarnivore activity. Slender and yellow mongooses displayed the highest coefficient of activity overlap (0.90), followed by marsh mongoose and rusty-spotted genet (0.80), and serval and rusty-spotted genet (0.79). These species are likely to have the highest potential for competitive interactions, but preferences for different vegetation characteristics and variations in the estimated relative abundance may point to coexistence through spatial and fine-scale temporal partitioning.

Here, we present lion population vital rates across 16 small, fenced reserves in South Africa to test whether varying social ecological conditions, associated with lion population structures, can drive changes in vital rates. Study reserves were categorized (A-D) according to the number of resident prides and male coalitions. Lion population structure within a reserve affected lion vital rates differentially, and lion population growth was highest in reserves that contained a single resident pride. The presence of more than one pride in a reserve resulted in a younger age at first birth and marginally longer birth intervals. The presence of extra-pride adult males reduced cub survival, lioness age at first birth and birth intervals.

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"Battle of the large carnivores: spatial partitioning in a small, enclosed reserve?","Interspecific competition among terrestrial carnivores can have widespread impacts on community structure and can ultimately determine which species are able to coexist. Within the carnivore guild, coexistence can be achieved through either spatial, temporal or dietary partitioning. The most effective method of avoiding competition may be spatial partitioning, as it removes the potential for negative interactions. The ways in which large carnivore species utilize and partition space in small, enclosed reserves in South Africa is currently poorly understood. This knowledge gap weakens our understanding of which mechanisms structure large carnivore communities in these systems. Thus, our aim was to use Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to investigate the spatial dynamics of large carnivores {[}four lions ( Panthera leo), three leopards (Panthera pardus) and three spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta)] on a small, enclosed reserve (Selati Game Reserve). Regarding home ranges, lions had considerable overlap among themselves (especially the females), leopards had minimal overlap, while spotted hyaenas had no home range overlap. Although we found no evidence for spatial partitioning amongst the collared large carnivores, differences in the habitat use patterns of the three large carnivore species is evident. The high prey abundance of Selati, carnivore predation strategies, behavioural adaptations and ecological separation could be facilitating the coexistence of lions, spotted hyaenas and leopards in Selati.

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Exploring perceptions of subsistence farmers in northwestern Zimbabwe towards the African lion (Panthera leo) in the context of local conservation actions,"We explored the perceptions held by subsistence farmers (living in communal lands within the CAMPFIRE programme area in northwestern Zimbabwe) towards the African lion (Panthera leo) and related conservation interventions undertaken by management authorities. Conceptually guided by the cognitive hierarchy, we used a semi-structured, face-to-face interview format to collect data across three different farming communities bordering Hwange and Zambezi National Parks. Ordinal regression models were used to analyse the data. Our results illustrate that farmers' perceptions towards lions were strongly negative and appeared to be associated with the geographic location in which the farmer lived, as well as the farmer's ethnic group. We also found that perceptions towards lions were not associated with specific livestock losses or to the potential benefits farmers received from wildlife conservation, e.g. school classroom blocks or road improvements. Instead, we suggest that fear of lions and perceived risk to livestock or human wellbeing may play a stronger role in shaping farmers' perceptions compared to actual livestock losses. Moreover, we suggest that sharing information across farmer social networks within a community area, along with the potential for media attention over sensational events, may also influence perceptions towards lions. Our results contribute a baseline dataset for future applied research in this area, and provide insight into developing locally-meaningful conservation interventions, including the type of information to be shared, channels for communication, and the benefits derived from participating in wildlife conservation.",human-lion conflict; livestock depredation; Panthera leo; subsistence farmers; Zimbabwe,2020,50,1,10.3957/056.050.0102,2410-7220,21,154,233,1670,5,12,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"Factors contributing to the springbok population decline in the Kalahari, Botswana","Nationwide aerial animal censuses of Botswana between 1992 and 2012, conducted by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, have highlighted a 71\% decline in the national springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) population and a contraction of their range. The reasons for this decline remain unknown. We investigated possible drivers of this decline in the southern Kalahari of Botswana. We assessed springbok resource selection levels, movement behaviour and seasonal and spatial effects on the juvenile:adult female ratio. Springbok displayed high levels of forage and habitat selection. Their dependency on pan habitats renders their distribution predictable, which could expose them to high levels of predation and poaching. Springbok moved shorter daily distances during the hot dry and longer distances during wet seasons. High temperatures during the hot dry season could limit movement and prevent exploitation of spatially and temporally heterogeneous resources. We recorded a ratio of 0.37 juvenile:1 adult female in the wet season months followed by a ratio decline to 0.10:1 in the subsequent cold dry season, indicating a low recruitment rate that could be contributing to the springbok population decline. Environmental changes and anthropogenic disturbances, exacerbated by climate change, will likely exert a negative influence on selective foragers like springbok.",population demographics; herbivore; selection; functional habitats; seasonal movement; vulnerability,2020,50,1,10.3957/056.050.0119,2410-7220,11,82,199,1382,6,12,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"Farmer attitudes and regional risk modelling of human-wildlife conflict on farmlands bordering the Boland Mountain Complex, South Africa","Human-wildlife conflict in unprotected areas, especially those bordering reserves, has resulted in the global home range and population size reduction of naturally occurring wildlife. Simultaneously, rural communities and commercial farmlands at the interface of human development and natural habitat face severe threats to their livelihoods and agricultural security, often resulting in the vast eradication of real or perceived damage-causing animals (DCAs). The knowledge of local people was relied on to elucidate the dynamic and interwoven social, economic and ecological factors giving rise to the largely undocumented conflict between landowners and wildlife adjacent to the Boland Mountain Complex, South Africa. Subsequently, the spatial location of observed and expected zones of species-specific risk on a regional level was anticipated and mapped using a maximum entropy algorithm. The highest level of tolerance by farmers was shown for primates and ungulates, while tolerance for carnivores, avifauna and invasive or feral species were comparatively lower. The results presented in this manuscript will enable the prioritization of locations and species to create improved mitigation and management plans.

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Habitat use by a large herbivore guild in a fenced South African protected area,"In fenced protected areas with limited opportunities to disperse, resources and constraints vary in space and time, affecting herbivore behaviour. The distribution, availability and quality of resources, burnt areas, and potential inter-specific competition all play a role in sustaining populations of large sympatric African herbivores. We investigated the role of resources, constraints and interspecific relationships on habitat use by three ruminants - black and blue wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou, C. taurinus) and red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), and a non-ruminant, plains zebra (Equus quagga), across seasons and in different landscape types in a South African reserve. Black wildebeest, blue wildebeest and red hartebeest preferred the open grassland landscape, with homogeneous vegetation, while zebra favoured the wooded grassland landscape, with more heterogeneous vegetation. Burnt areas and vegetation greenness were important for all species, while elevation represented a constraint for black wildebeest only. The presence/absence of other species was important in shaping landscape use for black and blue wildebeest, and this suggests the possibility of competition. Our findings confirm the importance of heterogeneity and, in particular, the important role of a planned burning regime in maintaining such heterogeneity to sustain multi-species herbivore assemblages in small fenced nature reserves, where competition might arise between species using similar resources.",large herbivore habitat use; competition in a small fenced reserve; heterogeneity; NDVI; red hartebeest; zebra; black wildebeest; blue wildebeest,2020,50,1,10.3957/056.050.0086,2410-7220,14,79,203,1496,8,12,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,"A dense sample of fossil primates (Adapiformes, Notharctidae, Notharctinae) from the Early Eocene Willwood Formation, Wyoming: Documentation of gradual change in tooth area and shape through time","Objectives The Willwood Formation of the southern Bighorn Basin, Wyoming is a fluvial rock sequence that spans approximately 3 million years of early Eocene time. It has yielded one the largest collections of fossil mammals in the world including thousands of dentitions of extinct lemur-like primates known as notharctines. In the southern Bighorn Basin, specimens of these primates have been collected on numerous paleontological expeditions and the stratigraphic levels yielding the dentitions have been carefully recorded. Notharctine dentitions represent a rare opportunity to study morphological variation in a single anatomical system through time among closely related individuals. Materials and Methods Prior studies of Bighorn Basin notharctines through time produced measurements of hundreds of specimens but I report here results from measurement and comparison of the dentitions and dentaries of more than 3,000 specimens, all stratigraphically mapped. Results Variation in premolar and molar area and variation in dentary depth are apparent throughout the section. Specimens with relatively small teeth and dentaries are known from the older part of the section. In younger rocks, variation in tooth area among specimens increases. Variation in tooth area is continuous and overlaps extensively both within and between stratigraphic levels. Other dental variables examined by inspection change in a mosaic and continuous fashion through the section. These features include variation in the presence and number of paraconids on the lower fourth premolar (p4), the size and shape of the entoconid notch on the lower first and second molars, and the relative development of the pseudohypocone, mesostyle, and cingula on the upper molars. Discussion These broad patterns can be identified despite notharctine alpha taxonomy being in need of extensive revision and, importantly, simplification. Such revision is beyond the scope of this article but is essential if we are to develop a taxonomy that is both free of stratigraphic influence and useful for rapid, repeatable species assignment. Boundaries among the patterns of tokogenesis, anagenesis, and cladogenesis are blurred in this dense sample of extinct primates. While pattern of evolution, a population-level phenomenon, may be difficult to falsify in the fossil record, this notharctine sample suggests that in the rare instance such as this, when the fossil record is densely sampled, change through time is continuous and more consistent with gradual evolution.",adapid; dentition; Eocene; gradualism; primate,2021,174,4,10.1002/ajpa.24177,0002-9483,27,195,373,2532,5,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,A geometric morphometric assessment of shape variation in adult pelvic morphology,"Objectives In humans, the pelvis is the most sexually dimorphic skeletal element and is often utilized in aging and sexing remains. The pelvis has become greatly relied upon in anthropological research (e.g., forensics, demographics, obstetrics, evolutionary history); however, pelvis morphology is highly variable, and very little is known about the nature, sources, patterning, and interpretation of this variation. This study aims to quantify pelvis shape variation, document sexual shape variation, and estimate the plasticity of morphology. This will ultimately give greater ability to interpret modern, archaeological, and evolutionary patterns to gain deeper insight into processes which shape human anatomy. Materials and methods Using a sample of 129 Medieval Danish skeletons, shape variation is documented in the greater sciatic notch (GSN), iliac crest (IC), arcuate line (AL), and sub-pubic angle (SPA) using 3D geometric morphometrics. The landmarking method applied here has the advantage of being applicable to fragmentary remains, rather than requiring whole bones. This allows it to be easily applied to archaeological samples and for the interpretation of separate bone features. Differences in shape were statistically analyzed by principle component analysis, linear discriminate analysis, and morphological disparity. Relationships between maximum femur length, body mass, and shape centroid size were also test by allometric regression. Results Results quantify the sexual dimorphism and shape variation present in these features. The GSN shape is the most variable, while the AL is the least. Similarly, the IC is the only feature which shows almost no dimorphism in shape, and instead best reflects lifestyle/activity patterns. Evidence of dimorphism in the IC is likely a result of cultural labor patterns rather than genetic and hormonal influence. Finally, the shapes of the GSN, AL, and SPA are more related to body mass than to femur length, such that individuals with increased mass exhibit more classically ``male{''} shapes and those with less mass have more ``female{''} shapes. Discussion The results have important implications for the evolution of pelvic anatomy, and sexual dimorphism, but also highlight the plasticity inherent in pelvic morphology. Analyzing pelvis features separately in a clearly defined, relatively genetically homogenous population gives insight into the determinants of bone morphology, which are not readily observable by other means. The relationship between body mass and shape suggests dimorphism in body size and composition may affect bone shape.",geometric morphometrics; human variation; pelvis; plasticity; sexual dimorphism,2021,176,4,10.1002/ajpa.24399,0002-9483,11,81,379,2614,5,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes

Comparative samples include Late Pleistocene humans and Neolithic populations from Northern and Southern China. Univariate and multivariate analyses are carried out in the study. Results ZG 1 has a dolichocephalic cranium, wide zygomatic breadth, moderate glabella and supraobtial projection, marked canine fossa, and thin cranial vault. The nasal floor, maximum cranial breadth position, and frontal arc proportion are all congruent with modern human. Statistical analysis suggests that ZG 1's measurements are most similar to those of Southern China Neolithic specimens, with some closer to Late Pleistocene humans.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,Beyond faith: Biomolecular evidence for changing urban economies in multi-faith medieval Portugal,"Objectives During the Middle Ages, Portugal witnessed unprecedented socioeconomic and religious changes under transitioning religious political rule. The implications of changing ruling powers for urban food systems and individual diets in medieval Portugal is poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the dietary impact of the Islamic and Christian conquests. Materials and Methods Radiocarbon dating, peptide mass fingerprinting (ZooMS) and stable isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15) of animal (n = 59) and human skeletal remains (n = 205) from Muslim and Christian burials were used to characterize the diet of a large historical sample from Portugal. A Bayesian stable isotope mixing model (BSIMM) was used to estimate the contribution of marine protein to human diet. Results Early medieval (8-12th century), preconquest urban Muslim populations had mean (+/- 1SD) values of -18.8 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand for delta C-13 10.4 +/- 1 parts per thousand for delta N-15, indicating a predominantly terrestrial diet, while late medieval (12-14th century) postconquest Muslim and Christian populations showed a greater reliance on marine resources with mean (+/- 1SD) values of -17.9 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 11.1 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand for delta N-15. BSIMM estimation supported a significant increase in the contribution of marine resources to human diet. Discussion The results provide the first biomolecular evidence for a dietary revolution that is not evidenced in contemporaneous historical accounts. We find that society transitioned from a largely agro-pastoral economy under Islamic rule to one characterized by a new focus on marine resources under later Christian rule. This economic change led to the naissance of the marine economy that went on to characterize the early-modern period in Portugal and its global expansion.",bioarchaeology; fishing; medieval; paleodiet; Portugal,2021,176,2,10.1002/ajpa.24343,0002-9483,12,97,283,1876,5,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes

Materials and Methods: We carried out bone isotope analyses concerning delta C-13 in collagen and apatite, the spacing between both carbon sources and delta N-15 in a sample of 23 subadult and adult individuals of both sexes recovered from Late Holocene archaeological sites, ranging from 1665 +/- 45 to 680 +/- 80 C-14 years BP. Results and Discussion: The results indicate that exclusive breastfeeding continued until the age of similar to 2 years, and weaning probably until 4 years of age. Supplementary foods included C-3 plants and probably animal fats and C-4 carbohydrates. A high fractionation of 4.9 parts per thousand in delta N-15 values was recognized between breastfeeding infants and adult females, perhaps reflecting episodic hyper-protein diets in women linked to men's food provisioning during women's gestational/postpartum period. Additionally, male adults present a higher protein intake than females. Although this difference is not statistically significant with the current sample size, it could be a clue related to a sexual division in food procurement.",breastfeeding; complex hunter-gatherers; South American archaeology; stable isotopes,2021,176,3,10.1002/ajpa.24381,0002-9483,14,102,186,1245,4,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
AMERICAN NATURALIST,Climate Change Alters Sexual Signaling in a Desert-Adapted Frog,"Climate change is altering species' habitats, phenology, and behavior. Although sexual behaviors impact population persistence and fitness, climate change's effects on sexual signals are understudied. Climate change can directly alter temperature-dependent sexual signals, cause changes in body size or condition that affect signal production, or alter the selective landscape of sexual signals. We tested whether temperature-dependent mating calls of Mexican spadefoot toads (Spea multiplicata) had changed in concert with climate in the southwestern United States across 22 years. We document increasing air temperatures, decreasing rainfall, and changing seasonal patterns of temperature and rainfall in the spadefoots' habitat. Despite increasing air temperatures, spadefoots' ephemeral breeding ponds have been getting colder at most elevations, and male calls have been slowing as a result. However, temperature-standardized call characters have become faster, and male condition has increased, possibly due to changes in the selective environment. Thus, climate change might generate rapid, complex changes in sexual signals with important evolutionary consequences.",climate change; mate signal; sexual selection; acoustic communication; spadefoot toad; desert,2023,201,1,10.1086/722174,0003-0147,9,63,156,1173,6,10,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
AMERICAN NATURALIST,Impacts of Flowering Density on Pollen Dispersal and Gametic Diversity Are Scale Dependent,"Pollen dispersal is a key evolutionary and ecological process, but the degree to which variation in the density of concurrently flowering conspecific plants (i.e., coflowering density) shapes pollination patterns remains understudied. We monitored coflowering density and corresponding pollination patterns of the insect-pollinated palm Oenocarpus bataua in northwestern Ecuador and found that the influence of coflowering density on these patterns was scale dependent: high neighborhood densities were associated with reductions in pollen dispersal distance and gametic diversity of progeny arrays, whereas we observed the opposite pattern at the landscape scale. In addition, neighborhood coflowering density also impacted forward pollen dispersal kernel parameters, suggesting that low neighborhood densities encourage pollen movement and may promote gene flow and genetic diversity. Our work reveals how coflowering density at different spatial scales influences pollen movement, which in turn informs our broader understanding of the mechanisms underlying patterns of genetic diversity and gene flow within populations of plants.",pollen dispersal distance; allelic diversity; pollen dispersal kernel; phenology; flowering density,2023,201,1,10.1086/721918,0003-0147,13,90,152,1134,5,10,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
AMERICAN NATURALIST,A Behavioral Syndrome Linking Boldness and Flexibility Facilitates Invasion Success in Sticklebacks,"For a species to expand its range, it needs to be good at dispersing and also capable of exploiting resources and adapting to different environments. Therefore, behavioral and cognitive traits could play key roles in facilitating invasion success. Marine threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have repeatedly colonized freshwater environments and rapidly adapted to them. Here, by comparing the behavior of hundreds of lab-reared sticklebacks from six different populations, we show that marine sticklebacks are bold, while sticklebacks that have become established in freshwater lakes are flexible. Moreover, boldness and flexibility are negatively correlated with one another at the individual, family, and population levels. These results support the hypothesis that boldness is favored in invaders during the initial dispersal stage, while flexibility is favored in recent immigrants during the establishment stage, and they suggest that the link between boldness and flexibility facilitates success during both the dispersal stage and the establishment stage. This study adds to the growing body of work showing the importance of behavioral correlations in facilitating colonization success in sticklebacks and other organisms.",plasticity; persistence; novel object; intraspecific variation; convergent; rapid adaptation,2022,200,6,10.1086/721765,0003-0147,12,99,174,1244,6,10,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
AMERICAN NATURALIST,Adaptive Maternal Effects Shape Offspring Phenotype and Survival in Natal Environments,"Maternal effects can give newborns a head start in life by adjusting natal phenotypes to natal environments, yet their strength and adaptiveness are often difficult to investigate in natural populations. Here, we studied anticipatory maternal effects and their adaptiveness in common lizards in a seminatural experimental system. Specifically, we investigated how maternal environments (i.e., vegetation cover) and maternal phenotype (i.e., activity levels and body length) can shape offspring phenotype. We further studied whether such maternal effects influenced offspring survival in natal environments varying with respect to vegetation cover, conspecific density, and, consequently, maternal fitness. More active females from dense vegetation habitats produced bigger offspring than their less active counterparts, the contrary being true for sparse vegetation habitats. Moreover, females from dense vegetation habitats produced more active offspring and more active offspring survived better in dense vegetation habitats, resulting in greater maternal fitness through maternal effects. These results suggest adaptive anticipatory maternal effects, induced by vegetation structure and mediated by activity levels that may shape early-life prospects in natal environments.",intergenerational plasticity; activity; density-dependent effects; habitat quality; personality; common lizards,2022,200,6,10.1086/721873,0003-0147,11,86,169,1276,6,10,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
AMERICAN NATURALIST,Do Interactions among Microbial Symbionts Cause Selection for Greater Pathogen Virulence?,"The ecological and evolutionary consequences of microbiome treatments aimed at protecting plants and animals against infectious disease are not well understood, even as such biological control measures become more common in agriculture and medicine. Notably, we lack information on the impacts of symbionts on pathogen fitness with which to project the consequences of competition for the evolution of virulence. To address this gap, we estimated fitness consequences for a common plant pathogen, Ustilago maydis, over differing virulence levels and when the host plant (Zea mays) is coinfected with a defensive symbiont (Fusarium verticillioides) and compared these fitness estimates to those obtained when the symbiont is absent. Here, virulence is measured as the reduction in the growth of the host caused by pathogen infection. Results of aster statistical models demonstrate that the defensive symbiont most negatively affects pathogen infection and that these effects propagate through subsequent stages of disease development to cause lower pathogen fitness across all virulence levels. Moreover, the virulence level at which pathogen fitness is maximal is higher in the presence of the defensive symbiont than in its absence. Thus, as expected from theory for multiple parasites, competition from the defensive symbiont may cause selection for increased pathogen virulence. More broadly, we consider that the evolutionary impacts of interactions between pathogens and microbial symbionts will depend critically on biological context and environment and that interactions among diverse microbial symbionts in spatially heterogeneous communities contribute to the maintenance of the highly diverse symbiotic functions observed in these communities.",microbiome; defensive symbiosis; parasites; virulence evolution; disease control; aster analysis,2022,199,2,10.1086/717679,0003-0147,11,89,249,1755,6,10,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
AMERICAN NATURALIST,Evidence of Biological Self-Organization in Spatial Patterns of a Common Tropical Alga,"Tropical reef communities contain spatial patterns at multiple scales, observable from microscope and satellite alike. Many of the smaller-scale patterns are generated physiologically (e.g., skeletal structures of corals at <1-m scale), while some of the larger patterns have been attributed to scale-dependent feedbacks (e.g., spur and groove reefs at 10-100-m scales). In describing the spatial patterning of reef benthic communities at landscape levels, we uncovered unique spatial patterning among living marine algae. Populations of the calcifying green alga Halimeda were observed to form a consistent polygonal pattern at a characteristic scale of 3-4 m. The pattern showed no clear evidence of having been formed through biologically created shifts in hydrodynamical conditions or related mechanisms. In considering the specifics of Halimeda growth patterns, a model of self-organization involving separation and patterned extension is proposed, a mechanism revealed in some geological pattern formation. This observation reinforces the diversity of pathways by which striking spatial patterns can occur in ecosystems.",spatial patterns; emergent patterns; Halimeda; coral reefs,2022,NA,NA,10.1086/721323,0003-0147,12,86,157,1126,4,10,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
AMERICAN NATURALIST,Exploring Conditions That Strengthen or Weaken the Ecological and Evolutionary Consequences of Phenological Synchrony,"Climate change-driven phenological shifts alter the temporal distributions of natural populations and communities, but we have little understanding of how these shifts affect natural populations. Using agent-based models, we show that the interaction of within-population synchrony (individual variation in timing) and timing of interspecific interactions shapes ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations within a seasonal cycle. Low-synchrony populations had lower survival and biomass but relatively stronger individuals. These effects were surprisingly robust and did not require size-based competitive asymmetries. However, reducing population synchrony could either negatively or positively affect population demography depending on whether the phenology of the focal species was advanced or delayed relative to its competitor. Furthermore, selection for earlier hatching increased when the interspecific competitor arrived earlier and when population synchrony was high. These results emphasize the importance of variation in the phenology of individuals within populations to better understand species interactions and predict ecological and evolutionary outcomes of phenological shifts.",phenology; phenological synchrony; agent-based model; population demography; species interactions; competition,2022,NA,NA,10.1086/720899,0003-0147,14,117,154,1204,6,10,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes

Using data from nests of Ceratina australensis from three different wild bee populations, we combine metabarcoding and network approaches to explore the existence of individual variation in resource use within and across populations and whether dietary specialization affects the richness of pollen-associated microbes. We reveal the existence of marked dietary specialization. In the most specialized population, we also show that individuals' diet breadth was positively related to the richness of fungi but not bacteria. Overall, individual specialization appeared to have a weak or negligible effect on the microbial richness of nests, suggesting that different mechanisms beyond environmental transmission may be at play regarding microbial acquisition in wild bees.",small carpenter bee; diet breadth; native bee; network centrality; pollen metabarcoding; plant-pollination network,2022,NA,NA,10.1086/721023,0003-0147,21,149,132,983,6,10,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
AMERICAN NATURALIST,Kangaroo Fathers Modulate Maternal Control of Offspring Sex but Not Postpartum Maternal Expenditure,"When sons and daughters have different fitness costs and benefits, selection may favor deviations from an even offspring sex ratio. Most theories on sex ratio manipulation focus on maternal strategies and sex-biased maternal expenditure. Recent studies report paternal influences on both offspring sex ratio and postpartum sex-biased maternal expenditure. We used long-term data on marked kangaroos to investigate whether and how paternal mass and skeletal size, both determinants of male reproductive success, influenced (a) offspring sex in interaction with maternal mass and (b) postpartum sex-biased maternal expenditure. When mothers were light, the probability of having a son increased with paternal mass. Heavy mothers showed the opposite trend. A similar result emerged when considering paternal size instead of mass. Postpartum maternal sex-specific expenditure was independent of paternal mass or size. Studies of offspring sex manipulation or maternal expenditure would benefit from an explicit consideration of paternal traits, as paternal and maternal effects can modulate each other.",marsupial; offspring sex manipulation; paternal effect; sex-biased expenditure; Trivers-Willard hypothesis,2022,200,6,10.1086/721437,0003-0147,13,99,155,1098,5,10,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,Influence of dense macrophyte vegetation and total gas saturation on the performance of acoustic telemetry,"Background Acoustic telemetry is widely used as a method for high resolution monitoring of aquatic animal movement to investigate relationships between individual animals and their environment. In shallow freshwater ecosystem, aquatic macrophytes are common and their presence increases habitat complexity and baffles sound propagation. These properties may be likely to affect the performance of acoustic telemetry, however, to date this issue has received little attention, when studying the ecology of movements of fishes in and around the important macrophyte habitats. Here, we conducted a range-test study in a freshwater riverine ecosystem, with mass development of the aquatic macrophyte Juncus bulbosus (L.), to assess how dense macrophytes impact detection probability, detection range, and performance of a three-dimensional receiver positioning system. Supersaturation of gas frequently occurs at the study site as a by-product of upstream hydroelectric power generation and gave a unique opportunity to investigate how total gas saturation affects the performance of acoustic telemetry. We also investigated the influence of environmental conditions (i.e., day-of-year, time of day, average water level above J. bulbosus) on detection probability together with vertical position of transmitters and location inside or outside macrophytes. Results The detection probability and range were generally low for transmitters in and outside J. bulbosus stands, with mean hourly detection probabilities ranging from 1.18 to 5\% and detection ranges between 17.26 m +/- 0.74. The interaction between total macrophyte biomass and distance to receiver reduced the detection probability and detection range substantially. Detection probability further decreased with increasing total gas saturation, and transmitters positioned near the sediment and close to the surface also had lower detection probabilities compared to receivers in the middle of the water column. Finally, the low detection probability affected position estimates, where only 23\% of the detections could be positioned using the average positioning estimation method and positional accuracy and precision were low ranging from 1.48 to 164.8 m and 0 to 50.1 m, respectively. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the impact of macrophytes and total gas saturation on detection probability and range of acoustic transmitters in a shallow ecosystem, where tagged fish are unlikely to be detected by receivers or positioned. These results emphasise that in situ range testing is strongly needed before determining the density and design of receiver array when performing acoustic telemetry studies in shallow ecosystems.",Acoustic telemetry; Range testing; Aquatic plants; Juncus bulbosus; Passive monitoring; Detection probability; Gas supersaturation,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00275-1,NA,15,106,381,2686,7,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,yes,no,yes

Results Three tagged smolts were detected on marine acoustic receivers distributed across two separate arrays from different projects in the Irish Sea. One fish had migrated approximately 262 km in 10 days from the river mouth at Workington Harbour, Cumbria to the northernmost receiver array operated by the SeaMonitor project; this is the longest tracked marine migration of an Atlantic salmon smolt migrating from the United Kingdom. This migrating fish displayed behaviours which resulted in fast northward migration. The remaining two fish were detected on a receiver array operated by a third project: the Collaborative Oceanography and Monitoring for Protected Areas and Species (COMPASS). Conclusion These detections further provide evidence that migration to reach marine feeding grounds of at least a proportion of salmon smolts from rivers draining into the Irish Sea is northerly, though without a southern marine array it is impossible to conclude that this is the only route. The pattern of these detections would not have been possible without the collaborative efforts of three distinct and separately funded projects to share data. Further work is required to fully understand migration trajectories in this species on the west coast of the British Isles.",Salmo salar; Smolt; Acoustic telemetry; Migration; Irish Sea,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00274-2,NA,17,126,255,1678,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,Ultra-light photosensor collars to monitor Arctic lemming activity,"Background Studying the anti-predatory behavior of mammals represents an important challenge, especially for fossorial small mammals that hide in burrows. In the Arctic, such behaviors are critical to the survival of lemmings considering that predation risks are high every summer. Because detailed information about how lemmings use burrows as hideouts is still lacking, we developed a 1.59 g photosensitive collar to record any event of a small mammal moving between a dark area (e.g., burrow) and a bright area (e.g., outside the burrow). Tests of how collars affected lemming behavior were conducted in captivity in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada, in November 2019 and field tests were conducted on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada, in August 2021. Results The device was made of two chemical batteries and a printed circuit board (PCB) equipped with a photosensor and a real-time clock that recorded amplitude transient thresholds of light (lux) continuously. In accordance with ethical use of such devices, we verified that no abnormal loss of body mass was observed in captive or free-ranging lemmings, and no difference in recapture rates were observed between those with and without a collar, though we could not test this for periods longer than 108 h. Measurements of light intensities revealed consistent patterns with high lux levels at mid-day and lowest during the night. Lemmings showed clearly defined behavioral patterns alternating between periods outside and inside burrows. Despite 24-h daylight in the middle of the summer, August nighttime (i.e., 11 PM to 4 AM) lux levels were insufficient for amplitude transient thresholds to be reached. Conclusion By taking advantage of the long periods of daylight in the Arctic, such technology is very promising as it sets new bases for passive recording of behavioral parameters and builds on the prospect of further miniaturization of batteries and PCBs.",Light sensor; Modern ethology; Lemmus trimucronatus; Dicrostonyx hudsonius; Dicrostonyx groenlandicus; Subterranean; Predator refugia,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00302-1,NA,8,66,298,1917,7,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,Eavesdropping on the brain at sea: development of a surface-mounted system to detect weak electrophysiological signals from wild animals,"Despite rapid advances in sensor development and technological miniaturization, it remains challenging to non-invasively record small-amplitude electrophysiological signals from an animal in its natural environment. Many advances in ecophysiology and biologging have arisen through sleep studies, which rely on detecting small signals over multiple days and minimal disruption of natural animal behavior. This paper describes the development of a surface-mounted system that has allowed novel electrophysiological recordings of sleep in wild marine mammals. We discuss our iterative design process by providing sensor-comparison data, detailed technical illustrations, and material recommendations. We describe the system's performance over multiple days in 12 freely moving northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) sleeping on land and in water in captivity and the wild. We leverage advances in signal processing by applying independent components analysis and inertial motion sensor calibrations to maximize signal quality across large (> 10 gigabyte), multi-day datasets. Our study adds to the suite of biologging tools available to scientists seeking to understand the physiology and behavior of wild animals in the context in which they evolved.",Northern elephant seal; Mirounga angustirostris; Electrocardiogram; Electroencephalogram; Brain activity; Heart rate; Diving; Biologging; Neuroscience,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00287-x,NA,19,136,173,1260,9,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,A validation of abstracted dive profiles relayed via the Argos satellite system: a case study of a loggerhead turtle,"Satellite telemetry devices can record movement data of animals along with the environmental data. Such data are relayed remotely via satellite systems, but are constrained by the limited bandwidth availability. A satellite relay data logger (SRDL) that can abstract dive profiles and compress the data for transmission using a broken stick model (BSM) has been widely used in studies on dive behavior and physiology of marine animals. However, there is still uncertainty in the abstracted dive profiles. Here, we aimed to evaluate the certainty of abstracted dive profiles (via satellite communication) in terms of dive performance (dive depth, duration, and dive type) by comparing it with the actual dive data (from the retrieved tag) in a loggerhead turtle deployed with the SRDL throughout a 1.4-year foraging period. There was no significant difference in the maximum dive depth between the retrieved and satellite transmission data; however, there was a slight but significant difference in the dive duration. The dives from both datasets were classified into five types. Inconsistent dive classifications occurred in 1.7\% of the data. There was no significant difference in the proportion of time spent diving between the retrieved and satellite transmission data for each type during the common recording period. In monthly scale comparisons, however, a significant difference was detected when the amount of data via satellite transmission was the smallest. Our results demonstrated that the dive data abstracted using BSM almost reconstructed the actual dive profiles with certainty in a loggerhead turtle, although slight inconsistencies were observed.",Broken-stick model; Caretta caretta; Dive type; Dive classification; Dive profile; Satellite relay data logger; Sea turtle,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00292-0,NA,19,116,250,1665,7,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,Using low-fix rate GPS telemetry to expand estimates of ungulate reproductive success,"Background Population parameters such as reproductive success are critical for sustainably managing ungulate populations, however obtaining these data is often difficult, expensive, and invasive. Movement-based methods that leverage Global Positioning System (GPS) relocation data to identify parturition offer an alternative to more invasive techniques such as vaginal implant transmitters, but thus far have only been applied to relocation data with a relatively fine (one fix every < 8 h) temporal resolution. We employed a machine learning method to classify parturition/calf survival in cow elk in southeastern Kentucky, USA, using 13-h GPS relocation data and three simple movement metrics, training a random forest on cows that successfully reared their calf to a week old. Results We developed a decision rule based upon a predicted probability threshold across individual cow time series, accurately classifying 89.5\% (51/57) of cows with a known reproductive status. When used to infer status of cows whose reproductive outcome was unknown, we classified 48.6\% (21/38) as successful, compared to 85.1\% (40/47) of known-status cows. Conclusions While our approach was limited primarily by fix acquisition success, we demonstrated that coarse collar fix rates did not limit inference if appropriate movement metrics are chosen. Movement-based methods for determining parturition in ungulates may allow wildlife managers to extract more vital rate information from GPS collars even if technology and related data quality are constrained by cost.",Reproduction; Parturition; Vital rates; GPS telemetry; Ungulates; Movement,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00276-0,NA,12,85,225,1555,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,Environmental correlates of activity and energetics in a wide-ranging social carnivore,"Background Environmental conditions can influence animal movements, determining when and how much animals move. Yet few studies have quantified how abiotic environmental factors (e.g., ambient temperature, snow depth, precipitation) may affect the activity patterns and metabolic demands of wide-ranging large predators. We demonstrate the utility of accelerometers in combination with more traditional GPS telemetry to measure energy expenditure, ranging patterns, and movement ecology of 5 gray wolves (Canis lupus), a wide-ranging social carnivore, from spring through autumn 2015 in interior Alaska, USA. Results Wolves exhibited substantial variability in home range size (range 500-8300 km(2)) that was not correlated with daily energy expenditure. Mean daily energy expenditure and travel distance were 22 MJ and 18 km day(-1), respectively. Wolves spent 20\% and 17\% more energy during the summer pup rearing and autumn recruitment seasons than the spring breeding season, respectively, regardless of pack reproductive status. Wolves were predominantly crepuscular but during the night spent 2.4 x more time engaged in high energy activities (such as running) during the pup rearing season than the breeding season. Conclusion Integrating accelerometry with GPS telemetry can reveal detailed insights into the activity and energetics of wide-ranging predators. Heavy precipitation, deep snow, and high ambient temperatures each reduced wolf mobility, suggesting that abiotic conditions can impact wolf movement decisions. Identifying such patterns is an important step toward evaluating the influence of environmental factors on the space use and energy allocation in carnivores with ecosystem-wide cascading effects, particularly under changing climatic conditions.",Alaska; Behavior; Canis lupus; Carnivore; Ecology; Energetics; Movement,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-021-00272-w,NA,11,86,245,1775,7,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,Validation of indwelling vaginal sensor to monitor body temperature in ewes,"Remote-sensing technology facilitates longitudinal collection of body temperature during periods of hot or cold environmental stress without human interference, producing high-frequency measurements whilst reducing labour and stress to the animal. A pilot study was conducted to validate an improved, minimally invasive method for the continual measurement of vaginal temperature (VT) in female sheep. A silicon mould of a modified controlled internal drug release (CIDR) device (Zoetis Animal Health, Parsippany), was manufactured to securely house a temperature logger (Micro-T 16-bit; Star Oddi, Iceland) and allow direct contact at the collection site. These temperature-sensing CIDR devices were validated against manual rectal temperature (RT) measurements collected from 15 mature, non-pregnant, non-lactating Merino ewes. Rectal temperature was measured from each individual, six times per day in 2-h intervals for 14 consecutive days. The simultaneous measures of VT and RT did not differ significantly within each ewe (P > 0.05) and demonstrated a moderate linear relationship (R-2 = 0.62, P < 0.05). The mean (+/- SEM) difference between RT and VT was small (0.010 +/- 0.004 degrees C), with a 95\% confidence interval of - 0.26 to 0.29 degrees C. Additionally, the coefficient of variation was lower on average for VT (0.49\%) compared to RT (0.59\%). Differences among paired readings were likely due to interval variation as well as penetration depth, air influx and faecal temperature when collecting RT. The initial silicone manufacturing costs were high (2200 AUD), with each unit costing 1.25 (AUD) thereafter; however, the temperature-sensing CIDR device was an effective and efficient research tool for the remote monitoring of body temperature. While further validation of these devices within extensive grazing environments is warranted, the collection and analysis of longitudinal physiological data from ewes has the potential to improve a variety of management aspects related to extensively grazed ewes maintained and joined in harsh conditions.",Sheep; Telemetry; Indwelling temperature probe; Vaginal temperature monitoring; Core temperature; Physiology; Stress-induced hyperthermia,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00278-y,NA,11,75,302,2071,7,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,Development and validation of a drill attachment for faster and safer deployments of fin-mounted geolocators in large-bodied sharks,"Fin-mounted geolocators are widely used in marine studies to track animal movements and to design informed management strategies. However, the deployment protocols of such geolocators, which normally consist of drilling one to multiple holes using a template, can be challenging, and depending on the animal's stress physiology and ocean conditions, speed and accuracy may be crucial. Here, we present the plans for a drill attachment allowing the template-free drilling of up to four holes simultaneously for a faster, more accurate and safer deployment of fin-mounted geolocators. The drill attachment was successfully tested on four great and two scalloped hammerheads, Sphyrna mokarran and Sphyrna lewini, which were all tagged with 4-bolt Smart Position and Temperature (SPOT) tags. The time required to secure the geolocators, from drill alignment to the complete fastening of the last bolt, ranged from 68 to 85 s (78.2 +/- 10.9 s, mean +/- SD). The new drill attachment further allowed the successful tagging of a great hammerhead alongside a research vessel in rough seas that would have made the deployment using traditional protocols more challenging. Simultaneously drilling four holes reduces the need to keep the animal's fin steady for an extended period of time and thus makes the deployment of fin-mounted geolocators less dependent on the animal's behavior and the weather conditions. As such, the 4-hole drill attachment makes the mounting process faster and more reliable and should reduce the stress experienced by the animal.",Satellite telemetry; New deployment method; Fin-mounted transmitter; SPOT tag; Animal movement; Multi-hole drill,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00304-z,NA,18,131,238,1547,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,Can metrics of acceleration provide accurate estimates of energy costs of locomotion on uneven terrain? Using domestic sheep (Ovis aries) as an example,"Background Locomotion is often a necessity for animal survival and can account for a large proportion of an individual's energy budget. Therefore, determining the energy costs of locomotion is an important part of understanding the interaction between an animal and its environment. Measures of animal acceleration, specifically `dynamic body acceleration' (DBA) has proved to be a useful proxy of the energy cost of locomotion. However, few studies have considered the effects of interacting factors such as the animal's speed or changes to the terrain slope on the putative acceleration versus energy expenditure relationship and how this may affect the relationship between DBA and energy expenditure. Methods Here we conducted a methodological study to evaluate the ability of the metric `vectorial dynamic body acceleration', VeDBA, obtained from tri-axial accelerometer data loggers, to act as a proxy for energy expenditure in non-uniform environments. We used indirect calorimetry to measure the oxygen consumption (V?O-2) of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) that were exposed to different ambient temperatures when immobile (resting) and that walked at various speeds (0.8 to 2.9 km h(-1)) and slope angles (- 6 degrees to 6 degrees) on a treadmill while simultaneously measuring tri-axial acceleration recorded at 40 Hz by body-mounted tags. Results The lower critical temperature of sheep was identified as 18 degrees C, and V?O-2 when they were immobile was 3.67 mL O-2 kg(-1) min(-1). There were positive relationships between V?O-2,O- VeDBA, and speed of walking. However, VeDBA correlated less well with V?O-2 when the terrain slope either inclined or declined. Conclusions We advocate caution when using DBA metrics for establishing energy use in animals moving over uneven terrain and suggest that each study species or location must be examined on a case-by-case basis. Reliance upon the relationship described between acceleration and energy expenditure on horizontal-surface treadmills can lead to potential under- or over-estimates of energy expenditure when animals walk on uneven or inclined ground.",Dynamic body acceleration; Energy expenditure; Locomotion; Oxygen consumption; Slope; Terrain; Thermoregulation; Indirect calorimetry; Accelerometry; Treadmill,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00281-3,NA,23,151,316,2117,10,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,Detection range of two acoustic transmitters in four reservoir habitat types using passive receivers,"Background Recently, South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks (SDGFP), has undertaken a suite of rigorous acoustic telemetry studies. The goals and scope of the individual research projects vary but all use the same receiver array throughout Lake Sharpe in central South Dakota. Prior to initiating the telemetry studies, we sought to describe the detection probability of receivers from a representation of habitats within Lake Sharpe, South Dakota. We used both a V9-2H transmitter and a V13-1L transmitter in combination with VR2W 69 kHz passive receivers [}all from Innovasea (Vemco)] to determine detection probability in four novel habitats of Lake Sharpe. Both transmitter and receiver were moored at fixed distances (200 m 400, and 600 m) for multiple consecutive days and detection probability compared between transmitter type, distance, site, and diel period using ANOVA following arcsine square-root transformation. Results We found significant differences in detection probability between the four habitat types for both the V9 and V13 transmitters. Sites protected from wind and wave action, and with little boat traffic, had larger detection ranges compared to areas that were wind exposed and host more boat traffic. The site immediately downstream from a hydroelectric dam that is exposed to both high wind fetch and is popular for boating, exhibited the poorest detection probability at all distances for both transmitter types. V13 transmitters consistently exhibited greater detection probability relative to V9 transmitters and this difference was greater at further distances. In general, detection probability was higher at nighttime compared to daytime and these differences were significant dependent on transmitter, site, and distance. Conclusions Using the information presented, SDGFP has modified their receiver array to maximize the ability to detect acoustic transmitters in the novel habitats of Lake Sharpe. Specifically, receiver spacing was reduced and/or expanded dependent on the distance, where 50\% detection probability was attained. More work is needed to identify those factors that influence detection probability of acoustic telemetry systems.",Acoustic telemetry; Detection probability; Freshwater fish telemetry; Passive array; Range testing,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00291-1,NA,14,100,320,2195,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,Alternative measurement systems for recording cardiac activity in animals: a pilot study,"Monitoring and assessing cardiac activity in animals, especially heart rate variability, has been gaining importance in the last few years as an indicator of animal health, well-being and physical condition. This pilot study tested the sensors based on ballistocardiography sensing the mechanical vibrations caused by the animal's cardiovascular system, which have proved useful in measuring cardiac activity in humans. To verify the accuracy of these measurement systems, the conventional measurements based on electrocardiography were carried out and the outcomes were compared. The main objectives were to verify the suitability of these sensors in measuring cardiac activity in animals, to determine the advantages and disadvantages of these sensors, and to identify future challenges. Measurements were performed on various animals, specifically a goat, a cow, a horse, and a sheep. Electrocardiographic measurement, which has demonstrated high accuracy in procedures for animals, was used as the study's gold standard. A disadvantage of this method, however, is the long time required to prepare animals and shear spots to attach electrodes. The accuracy of a ballistocardiographic sensor was compared to reference electrocardiographic signals based on Bland-Altman plots which analysed the current heart rate values. Unfortunately, the ballistocardiographic sensor was highly prone to poor adhesion to the animal's body, sensor movement when the animal was restless, and motion artefacts. Ballistocardiographic sensors were shown only to be effective with larger animals, i.e., the horse and the cow, the size of these animals allowing sufficient contact of the sensor with the animal's body. However, this method's most significant advantage over the conventional method based on electrocardiography is lower preparation time, since there is no need for precise and time-demanding fixation of the sensor itself and the necessity of shaving the animal's body.",Animal electrocardiography (ECG); Heart rate variability (HRV); Heart rate (HR); Animal welfare; Stress; Veterinary monitoring; Ballistocardiography (BCG); Farm animals,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00286-y,NA,12,88,284,1966,8,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY,Taking the time for range testing: an approach to account for temporal resolution in acoustic telemetry detection range assessments,"Background In acoustic telemetry studies, detection range is usually evaluated as the relationship between the probability of detecting an individual transmission and the distance between the transmitter and receiver. When investigating animal presence, however, few detections will suffice to establish an animal's presence within a certain time frame. In this study, we assess detection range and its impacting factors with a novel approach aimed towards studies making use of binary presence/absence metrics. The probability of determining presence of an acoustic transmitter within a certain time frame is calculated as the probability of detecting a set minimum number of transmissions within that time frame. We illustrate this method for hourly and daily time bins with an extensive empirical dataset of sentinel transmissions and detections in a receiver array in a Belgian offshore wind farm. Results The accuracy and specificity of over 84\% for both temporal resolutions showed the developed approach performs adequately. Using this approach, we found important differences in the predictive performance of distinct hypothetical range testing scenarios. Finally, our results demonstrated that the probability of determining presence over distance to a receiver did not solely depend on environmental and technical conditions, but would also relate to the temporal resolution of the analysis, the programmed transmitting interval and the movement behaviour of the tagged animal. The probability of determining presence differed distinctly from a single transmission's detectability, with an increase of up to 266 m for the estimated distance at 50\% detection probability (D-50). Conclusion When few detections of multiple transmissions suffice to ascertain presence within a time bin, predicted range differs distinctly from the probability of detecting a single transmission within that time bin. We recommend the use of more rigorous range testing methodologies for acoustic telemetry applications where the assessment of detection range is an integral part of the study design, the data analysis and the interpretation of results.",Animal tracking; Biotelemetry; Detection probability; Presence; absence; Study design; System performance; Temporal resolution,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40317-022-00290-2,NA,19,131,311,2144,8,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Diet disparity and diversity predict extinction risk in primates,"Species vary in their vulnerability to extinction according to their biology, ecology, environmental factors and threats to which they are exposed. Diet is an important ecological trait that affects many aspects of a species' biology, including its vulnerability to extinction. Despite the importance of diet as a species' trait, its influence on extinction risk has only been studied in a coarse way, in part due to a lack of detailed diet data covering a large breadth of species or geographic areas. We examined the association between diet and extinction risk in primates, using a high-resolution dataset covering all major primate lineages and habitats on a global scale. The resolution of the dataset allowed us to calculate multiple biologically informative metrics for diet composition and diversity, allowing us to tease apart what aspects of diet were most important for predicting the risk of extinction, whilst accounting for phylogeny, body mass and geographic range size. Our results showed that both diet disparity and diet diversity predict primate extinction risk, showing that primates that are able to consume more types of items, and items that are more disparate from one another, are less prone to extinction. Furthermore, we found that although closely related species tend to have similar dietary diversity and disparity, these metrics vary widely amongst primate families. Primates with a high diet diversity and disparity may be able to cope better with fluctuations in food availability than species with homogeneous diet items, through a portfolio effect. Understanding the degree of dietary specialization of the species may help guide new studies relating to extinction risk and threats and be useful in future species assessments.",dietary specialization; diet diversity; portfolio effect; diet; extinction risk; extinction risk in primates; primate conservation,2023,26,3,10.1111/acv.12823,1367-9430,9,64,272,1761,7,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Disproportionate admixture improves reintroduction outcomes despite the use of low-diversity source populations: population viability analysis for a translocation of the greater stick-nest rat,"Translocation is becoming an increasingly important approach to threatened species conservation. Coupled with the knowledge that maximizing genetic diversity aids population establishment, the growing use of translocations can place unsustainable harvesting pressure on critical and vulnerable source populations. However, adaptive, genetically informed modelling tools such as Population Viability Analysis (PVA) can be used to predict translocation outcomes and optimize harvesting strategies. In this study, we use PVAs for the frequently translocated greater stick-nest rat (Leporillus conditor) to demonstrate the value of admixing founder populations for translocation, even when one source population is deemed genetically depauperate. This approach not only maximizes genetic diversity in the translocated population but reduces harvesting pressure on critical populations. Further, we show that admixed harvesting ratios can be skewed significantly towards the genetically depauperate population in order to further protect the critical population while still producing favourable outcomes, providing adequate founder numbers are used. As many threatened species are limited to fragmented and bottlenecked populations, these results are broadly applicable to the science of reintroduction biology, and demonstrate the value of PVAs for preliminary translocation planning and species management.",conservation genetics; population viability analysis; reintroduction biology; admixture; translocation; Leporillus conditor; reintroduction; genetic diversity,2023,26,2,10.1111/acv.12812,1367-9430,23,192,183,1403,8,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,"Does anthropization affect physiology, behaviour and life-history traits of Montagu's harrier chicks?","The last century has seen a steep decline in biodiversity, and anthropization is considered one of the major drivers of this decline. Anthropogenic disturbances, due to human presence and/or activities, may be perceived as chronic stressors by wildlife and potentially lead to deleterious effects on traits related to fitness. The main objective of the present study was to highlight the effects of these anthropogenic elements on wild birds on sparsely urbanized farmland, far less studied than in urbanized areas. We investigated during four successive breeding seasons whether the anthropization level, assessed by infrastructure density around nests, and the harvesting conditions around nests may impact physiological, behavioural and life-history traits of Montagu's harrier Circus pygargus chicks. Higher anthropization levels were associated with higher basal corticosterone levels in nestlings during only one breeding season and a lower body condition at fledging for females, probably because they suffered from higher starvation than males. Nestlings reared in more anthropized areas or in harvested crops before their fledging harboured more fault bars on rectrices than those reared in less anthropized areas or in unharvested crops regardless of year and sex, which is suggestive of higher stress during development. Nestling behaviours were also impacted by anthropization level and harvesting conditions: chicks in harvested crops were more aggressive and in areas with higher anthropization levels more prone to escape than others. Because Montagu's harrier is a protected species, the impacts highlighted in the present study are a matter of concern, especially regarding farmland landscape modifications, and we advise limiting perturbations in areas where Montagu's harriers usually nest.",Circus pygargus; corticosterone; disturbance; fault bars; perturbation; stress,2023,26,2,10.1111/acv.12810,1367-9430,12,101,260,1809,6,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Global warming facilitates the nesting of the loggerhead turtle on the Mediterranean coast of Spain,"The ranges of many species are shifting poleward as global warming intensifies, but this process might be less intense in philopatric species, i.e. those with the tendency to reproduce at their natal sites. Marine turtles are highly philopatric and their vulnerability to global warming is exacerbated by a life history combining delayed sexual maturity, temperature-dependent sex determination and low embryo survival at high incubation temperature. Detection of nesting events of loggerhead turtles in the Western Mediterranean Sea has increased largely during the first two decades of the 21st century, which could be a response to global warming or the result of increased sampling effort. The deployment of temperature data loggers at 52 beaches scattered along the Mediterranean coast of Spain demonstrated that sand temperature is currently high enough to allow the incubation of loggerhead turtles clutches in most Spanish beaches. However, the reconstruction of sand temperature from 1950 to 2019 revealed that thermal conditions suitable for the regular nesting of loggerhead turtles have existed in Spanish beaches only since 2010, although sporadic nesting was possible previously in exceptionally warm years. The future establishment of a self-sustained population would probably require further increases in temperature, to ensure a female-biased offspring production, but the process might be jeopardized by increased erosion and beach flooding resulting from sea level rise.",Caretta caretta; feminization; marine turtles; migration; philopatry; global warming; climate change; temperature,2023,26,3,10.1111/acv.12828,1367-9430,15,99,217,1490,8,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Ground-based vegetation descriptions and remote sensing as complementary methods describing habitat requirements of a frugivorous primate in northern Madagascar: implications for forest restoration,"Non-human primate species are threatened worldwide. Their population declines go along with the loss of ecological functions such as seed dispersal that plays a crucial role in plant regeneration. Restoring essential habitat structures could thus not only protect primates, but also facilitate forest regeneration. We used classical vegetation description on the ground and a remote sensing analysis to describe habitat use of crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus), a seed-dispersing primate endemic to northern Madagascar. Our aim was to find vegetation characteristics important for lemurs that might be targeted in a restoration approach. For this, we applied both methods in differently degraded forest types. Both classical vegetation description and remote sensing analysis were able to distinguish these forest types. The habitat use of our two study groups was associated consistently with vegetation structures measured on a small scale such as tree height and density of thick trees. In contrast, vegetation productivity and water content derived from satellite imagery on a larger scale could not consistently explain habitat use of lemurs. Thus, measurements on the ground can identify suitable microhabitats that do not show on the satellite imagery scale. These microhabitats might be very important conservation elements to create buffer zones and corridors. Further, they might attract seed-dispersing species into degraded areas targeted for forest restoration, acting as natural regeneration nuclei. The potential of these microhabitats for conservation would not be recognized when analyses were based solely on landscape analyses on large scales.",point-centred quarter method; frugivores; landsat; NDVI; NDWI; EVI; MSAVI; dispersal,2023,26,4,10.1111/acv.12839,1367-9430,23,197,240,1663,8,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Group composition impacts reproductive output and population viability in captive white rhinoceros,"Captive breeding programmes can play an important role in the conservation of species threatened with extinction in the wild. White rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum, have suffered drastic declines due to illegal poaching across their range, and captive populations have the potential to safeguard this species from extinction. However, white rhinoceros birth rates in captivity have been extremely low, and there is substantial variation in breeding success between different institutions. A better understanding of the factors limiting their reproduction in captivity could improve their breeding management and conservation potential. This study used studbook data (n = 467) and comparisons with wild populations in Kenya (n = 236) to assess the breeding performance and viability of the European captive southern white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum simum, population. Our results show that the European population is declining 2\% annually under current demographic parameters. On average, just 10\% of females calved annually, in comparison to almost 40\% across wild populations. To become self-sustaining, this must increase to a minimum of 17\%, though reaching this target may lead to additional management challenges. Further analyses using studbook (n = 134 individuals) and multi-institutional questionnaire data (n = 20 institutions) suggest that modifying the social structure of captive groups could improve female breeding success. Institutions housing larger groups had proportionally greater breeding success, and females were more likely to copulate if housed with another breeding female, and more receptive to bulls if housed in a group with a lower mean age. These findings highlight the importance of considering social conditions in captive breeding programmes, particularly for species with complex social systems and low reproductive rates.",population viability analysis; southern white rhinoceros; captive breeding; social behaviour; conservation management,2023,26,3,10.1111/acv.12833,1367-9430,12,98,266,1866,5,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Identifying human-brown bear conflict hotspots for prioritizing critical habitat and corridor conservation in southwestern Iran,"Multiple studies have used species distribution models to identify human-wildlife conflict drivers. An important application of these models is spatial conflict resolution by accounting for habitat suitability and corridors. We used distribution and connectivity models to identify habitats and corridors for brown bear Ursus arctos in southwestern Iran with high risk of bear damages, and evaluated the effects of landscape composition and configuration on the predicted conflict hotspots. We used 154 locations of bear damage incidents along with a suit of predictors to develop risk models. To prepare predictive variables, we used brown bear occurrence data and a number of covariates to develop a suitability model. We then converted the suitability map into a resistance surface and used a connectivity model to predict corridors. Finally, the bear damages risk map, habitats and corridors were overlaid to prioritize conflict hotspots, corridors and habitats, and conflict-prone corridors. Proportion of suitable habitats, distance to village, density of forest patches, conservation areas and corridor bottlenecks were the main predictors contributing to bear damages risk. A total of 38.73\% of habitats, and 6.24\% of corridors across the 124 000-km(2) study area were identified as areas with high risk of bear damages. The risk of bear damage was also spatially associated with forests fragmentation and patchiness of habitat. Our results highlight the importance of landscape configuration and corridors when investigating the spatial patterns of bear damages. Our findings showed how the combination of distribution models and connectivity analysis can guide carnivore conservation planning aiming at reducing the risk of carnivore-inflicted damages.",brown bear; conflict hotspot; habitat suitability; human dimension; human-wildlife conflict; risk modeling; Iran; wildlife corridors,2023,26,1,10.1111/acv.12800,1367-9430,15,127,255,1764,8,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Influence of landscape and connectivity on anuran conservation: population viability analyses to designate protected areas,"Threatened species with restricted ranges are at risk from habitat fragmentation and loss, which amplifies genetic bottleneck and impacts of small changes to their environments. Ecological models including population viability analyses (PVAs) can predict the trajectory of populations in a way that is not invasive or detrimental to the study species. They can therefore be a vital tool in modeling populations for conservation purposes. Although habitat suitability models have been used in studies to suggest areas for protected area designation, PVAs are generally not used in this regard. Dryophytes suweonensis and Dryophytes flaviventris are two threatened treefrog species endemic to the Korean Peninsula. The two species face threats of habitat loss and degradation and predation by invasive species among others. We used an integrated modeling approach combining ecological niche, connectivity, and PVAs in Vortex to determine the likelihood of extinction of each species under baseline and protected area designation scenarios. Designation scenarios were simulated in Vortex through halting future reduction in carrying capacity (halting future degradation to sites through protected area status), reducing effects of catastrophes (mitigating the effects of drought), and reducing mortality rates (controlling invasive predator populations and ex situ raising of tadpoles to maturity). We classified the combination of these management efforts as ``active management{''} as opposed to ``no management,{'' which is currently being practiced. We additionally used a stepwise approach to determine designation priority of individual patches. Under current conditions (no management), the resulting effective metapopulations after 100 years were 167 +/- 325 individuals with an 86.5\% extinction probability for D. suweonensis and 165 +/- 200 individuals with a 90.3\% extinction probability for D. flaviventris. Under active management of all sites (93 sites covering 426.9 km(2)), the extinction probability was 0\% for both species with significantly increased metapopulation sizes, 15 910 +/- 2855 for D. suweonensis, and 4400 +/- 874 for D. flaviventris. Determining designation priority can inform the regulatory bodies on which habitat to designate and whether active or passive management should be applied. Without intervention, these species will be likely to face imminent extinction. In addition to being useful for government-imposed conservation management, our study can be followed by future studies as a methodology for prioritizing sites for protected area designation.",endangered species; Dryophytes; population viability analysis; landscape connectivity; ecological modeling; treefrog; Hylidae; conservation management,2023,26,3,10.1111/acv.12829,1367-9430,15,122,367,2593,8,NA,300,8,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Integrated spatial models foster complementarity between monitoring programmes in producing large-scale bottlenose dolphin indicators,"Over the last decades, large-scale ecological projects have emerged that require collecting ecological data over broad spatial and temporal coverage. Yet, obtaining relevant information about large-scale population dynamics from a single monitoring programme is challenging, and often several sources of data, possibly heterogeneous, need to be integrated. In this context, integrated models combine multiple data types into a single analysis to quantify the population dynamics of a targeted population. When working at large geographical scales, integrated spatial models have the potential to produce spatialized ecological estimates that would be difficult to obtain if data were analysed separately. In this study, we illustrate how spatial integrated modelling offers a relevant framework for conducting ecological inference at large scales. Focusing on the Mediterranean bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), we combined 21,464 km of photo-identification boat surveys collecting spatial capture-recapture data with 24,624 km of aerial line transect following a distance sampling protocol. We analysed spatial capture-recapture data together with distance sampling data to estimate the abundance and density of bottlenose dolphins. We compared the performances of the distance sampling model and the spatial capture-recapture model fitted independently to our integrated spatial model. The outputs of our spatial integrated models inform bottlenose dolphin ecological status in the French Mediterranean Sea and provide ecological indicators that are required for regional-scale ecological assessments like the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. We argue that integrated spatial models are widely applicable and relevant to conservation research and biodiversity assessment at large spatial scales.",bottlenose dolphins; data integration; distance sampling; integrated models; Marine Strategy Framework Directive; NIMBLE; spatial capture-recapture,2023,26,2,10.1111/acv.12815,1367-9430,14,133,245,1812,7,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Long-term reproductive costs of snare injuries in a keystone terrestrial by-catch species,"Extensive bushmeat hunting is a major threat to wildlife conservation worldwide, particularly when unselective methods such as wire snares kill target and non-target species (by-catch). Animals that escape from snares have injuries of varying severity, with effects on performance that are largely unknown, as most studies typically focus on immediate mortality caused by snaring. Here, we assessed the life-history costs of debilitating snare injuries in individually known female spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta in three clans in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. This keystone predator is a regular by-catch of illegal bushmeat hunting of herbivores in the Serengeti ecosystem. We monitored individuals which escaped from snares between May 1987 and March 2020 and survived long enough to return to their clan territories from commuting trips in the park and surrounding protected areas. Snares that inflicted debilitating injuries on females did not reduce longevity but did delay age at first reproduction and reduced both litter size and offspring survival to the age of 1 year. This long-term decrease in reproductive performance likely resulted from increased inflammatory and immune responses to the snare injury and/or a decreased ability to travel the long distances necessary to feed on migratory herbivores. While our results are based on a relatively small sample of females with debilitating injuries, they suggest that the total population-level costs of wire snares in terrestrial by-catch species may be underestimated and that future studies may need to account for the potential reproductive costs of sublethal snare injuries.",snare injury; illegal bushmeat hunting; reproductive costs; spotted hyena; by-catch; wire snare; life history; Serengeti National Park,2023,26,1,10.1111/acv.12798,1367-9430,12,89,245,1650,8,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Metamorphosis and seasonality are major determinants of chytrid infection in a paedomorphic salamander,"Chytridiomycosis, an emerging disease caused mostly by the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has caused massive amphibian population declines and extinctions worldwide. The ecology of this disease is mainly explained by the interaction of environmental factors, pathogen biology, and host traits including development. For paedomorphic salamanders, differences in B. dendrobatidis infection may be explained by metamorphosis and water physicochemical conditions. In this study, we aimed to determine the influence of environmental and host factors on B. dendrobatidis prevalence and infection intensity in the facultative paedomorphic salamander Ambystoma altamirani. We determined B. dendrobatidis prevalence and infection load in four populations of A. altamirani along 1 year (four seasons) and assessed their relationship with environmental factors and host metamorphic status (gilled or non-gilled). We found that B. dendrobatidis prevalence and infection load are largely explained by metamorphic status and environmental factors such as elevation, seasonality, water temperature, pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. To our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically show the effect of metamorphosis on B. dendrobatidis infection status across locations and seasons. This information may be used to understand the temporal dynamics of B. dendrobatidis-host interactions and to identify potential disease outbreaks that may cause cryptic sublethal effects on salamander populations. Our results will help in the development of conservation strategies for paedomorphic salamanders that are already considered threatened by anthropogenic factors such as habitat loss and climate change.",chytridiomycosis; paedomorphic salamanders; amphibian diseases; B; dendrobatidis,2023,26,3,10.1111/acv.12824,1367-9430,13,102,229,1707,5,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Not just the Big Five: African ecotourists prefer parks brimming with bird diversity,"Ecotourism helps sustain protected areas (PAs) that in turn conserve Africa's declining fauna. Identifying ecotourist preferences and which species and landscapes benefit from ecotourism could therefore support African biodiversity conservation efforts. Due to historic associations with trophy hunting and subsequent ecotourism marketing efforts, ecotourist preferences have been thought to traditionally center around the `Big Five': elephant, lion, buffalo, leopard, and rhinoceros. But these preferences may be evolving. Here, we ask two questions, one about the drivers and one about the consequences of ecotourism: (1) Which species and landscapes do ecotourists most prefer based on realized visitation data? And (2), differently, which species and landscapes benefit most from ecotourism? We gathered data on average annual tourist visits, the occurrence of nine mammals, bird species richness, forest cover, national wealth, local human population and accessibility for 164 Sub-Saharan African PAs. To address our first question, we used a Bayesian multivariable model to identify whether bird and megafaunal diversity explain visits to PAs while controlling for other factors. To address our second question, we used Bayesian univariate models to analyze the relationships between park visitation and each species/landscape. We found that tourist preferences extend beyond the Big Five to include bird diversity. We also observed that ecotourism may be well suited to conserve bird diversity, lion, cheetah, black and white rhinoceros, African wild dog and giraffe species. Collectively, our results may help inform how to leverage ecotourism to conserve African fauna.",ecotourism; megafauna; revealed preferences; Sub-Saharan Africa; protected areas; bird diversity,2023,26,4,10.1111/acv.12816,1367-9430,13,84,238,1679,6,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANIMAL CONSERVATION,Plastic pollution can affect the emergence patterns of the loggerhead turtle hatchlings,"Coastal urbanization, plastic pollution and climate change are increasingly affecting marine turtles' nesting habitats. In addition to facing risks of mortality due to saltwater inundation or predation, their eggs and hatchlings' might also be affected by plastic debris accumulation on beaches, but no studies to date have analysed such impact. To analyse whether plastic pollution on nests' surfaces affects the embryos' and hatchlings' survival odds, we designed a field experiment in a turtle hatchery on a nesting beach of the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) in Boa Vista Island (Cabo Verde). We applied three treatments with distinct plastic levels (18 nests per treatment): control (no added plastics), low density (64 plastic fragments with 24.5 g of plastic weight per nest) and high density (128 plastic fragments with 49.0 g of plastic weight per nest). Then, we tested 16 variables related to the incubation period, emergence period and hatchlings' fitness. Our results suggest that nests with high plastic density have a significantly lower probability of successful emergence. Moreover, plastics also affected the synchronized emergence of hatchlings, with more scattered and smaller emergent groups, which might increase the predation risk. Considering that turtle nesting habitats are becoming increasingly threatened, this additional threat might compromise the survival of turtle hatchlings on beaches.",Boa Vista island; Caretta caretta; Cabo Verde; emergence success; marine debris; nesting environment; sandy beaches; sea turtles,2023,26,4,10.1111/acv.12837,1367-9430,12,87,208,1424,8,NA,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

We used two robust indicators to identify and quantify two-year cycles in vendace population proxy time series at different life-stages - spawning stock biomass (SB), density of newly hatched larvae (LD) and recruitment (REC) - from 22 Finnish lakes. Then we applied Fisher's meta-analytical test to assess the adequacy of the evidence to support the hypothesis that vendace population dynamics include two-year cyclicity. The results supported this hypothesis for REC but not for SB or LD. Yet. the indicators and test are conservative and time-series of SB and LD are shorter than those for REC. The appearance of cycles in REC is associated with high post-recruitment mortality, consequently practically only one spawning per cohort. Cycles may be typical for the recovery period from low abundance period also. Still, some populations with moderate post-REC mortality and non-cyclic SB abundance exhibited cycles in REC.

ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI,"Phylogenetic relationships in vendace and least cisco, and their distribution areas in western Eurasia","I conducted a population-genetic study of the Eurasian cisco complex in an area extending from the Baltic Sea to the East-Siberian Sea using 30 enzyme loci. The results indicate that the least cisco (Coregonus sardinella) populations from most rivers of the Kara, Laptev and East-Siberian sea basins are genetically fairly homogeneous, and that the cluster they form is different from the one for the vendace (C. albula) populations from the waterbodies of the Baltic and White seas (Nei's genetic distance (D-N) = 0.076). The least cisco and vendace originated from two major phylogenetic lineages of the species occurring as the purest form in the above regions. As a result of the evolution and complex interactions among local populations within the two phylogenetic lineages of cisco at the various stages of Middle and Late Quaternary glaciations, most extant modern populations are hybrid in origin. For example, the Barents Sea populations and the easternmost population from the East-Siberian Sea basin (Kolyma River) emerged as a result of hybridization during the last colonization wave by the least cisco (East Siberian) along the Arctic coast upon cisco's interaction with local ciscoes in the west and east The White and Kovzhskoye lake populations from the Caspian Sea basin, which form a joint cluster with them, are the hybrids of the local vendace and the descendants of the first wave of least cisco's (West Siberian) expansion to Europe.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,Ancient genomes from the initial Jomon period: new insights into the genetic history of the Japanese archipelago,"Starting 16000 years ago, the Neolithic lifestyle known as the Jomon culture spread across the Japanese archipelago. Although extensively studied by archaeology and physical anthropology, little is known about the genetic characteristics of the Jomon people. Here, we report the entire mitogenome and partial nuclear genome of skeletal remains from the initial Jomon period that were excavated from the Higashimyo shell midden site at Saga City, Kyushu Island, Japan. This is the first genome analysis of the initial Jomon people of Kyushu Island. These results provide important data for understanding the temporal transition and regional differences of the Jomon people. The mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome haplogroups were similar to those found in the previously reported later Jomon people. Moreover, comparison of three nuclear genomes from the initial to final Jomon periods indicated genetic continuity throughout the Jomon period within the Japanese archipelago with no significant evidence of admixture. This indicates that the genetic differentiation found among the Jomon people was promoted by the progression of regionalization throughout the Jomon period. Further accumulation of high-quality Jomon genome data spanning a wide range of regions and ages will clarify both intimate regional and temporal differences of the Jomon people and details of their admixture history with rice fanners, as suggested by Jomon mitochondrial genome data.

Kim's work recorded the older, archaic topony ins before they were converted into sinicized (i.e. expressed with Chinese words) place names with two Chinese characters in 757 A.D. by the order of King Kyeongdeok. This paper maps specific words included in the place names of 783 locations for which the corresponding present places are evident. The following were words examined: (1) `river' and its related words; (2) `valley'; (3) `mountain' and `ridge'; and (4) `city' and `burg'. Japonic-sourced toponyms are typically distributed in the central and northern areas of the Yalu River, primarily in the district of Kogury6; however, they go beyond these regions. The use of Chinese loanwords is noted in the southern area, where determining which language was spoken is difficult. In a town near Seoul, the stem of the toponym belongs to the Korean language, whereas the unit word belongs to the Japonic language. This usage may be attributed to bilingualism, whereby Korean-speaking inhabitants used their own language for the stem of the place name. Mongolic and/or Tungusic loanwords are also found. In some cases, determining the language origin of the current toponyms is difficult. Therefore, the minute geographical distribution of the origin languages is displayed word by word.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,"Isotopic study of maize exploitation during the Formative Period at Pacopampa, Peru","Maize (Zea mays) was an important staple and ceremonial food in the pre-Columbian Andean world. Previous researchers have studied maize agriculture in early ancient Andean society by examining macro- and microbotanical remains. However, isotope analyses of human remains have shown that maize was not a primary food resource during the Formative Period (1800-1 cal BC). Although a few studies have suggested that maize was consumed in this period, we know little about how the dietary role of maize differed across the Andean society and how it changed over time. This study measures carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios from human and animal bone collagen samples and human tooth enamel samples excavated from the Pacopampa archaeological site in the highlands of northern Peru in order to better understand maize consumption in this period. The site dates to the Middle to Late Formative Periods (1200-700 cal BC, 700-400 cal BC) and the Early Cajamarca phase (cal AD 200-450). The findings indicate an increase in C-4 resource consumption during the Late Formative Period-an increase that we attribute directly to maize and indirectly to domesticated animals. Although dietary variation related to social stratification was insignificant at this site, it has been reported at and between some coeval sites. Thus, we conclude that when these populations began exploiting C-4 resources, their strategic use of these resources varied depending on the site. This study suggests that the use of maize during the Formative Period was probably greater and earlier than reported in previous isotope studies. In addition, maize utilization for domestic animals in this period, which has rarely been mentioned, was also important.",maize; diet; Andes; camelid pastoralism; guinea pig,2021,129,"2, SI",10.1537/ase.210531,0918-7960,12,83,266,1721,5,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,Modern human DNA analyses with special reference to the inner dual-structure model of Yaponesian,"Previous studies suggested two major migration events during the Jomon and Yayoi periods that affected the genetic diversity of modern Japanese (Yaponesians). We explored the possibility of a three-wave migration model by examining three datasets of modern human DNA: (1) whole mitochondrial (mt) DNA genomes of 1642 Yaponesians; (2) mtDNA haplogroup frequencies of 59105 Yaponesians from 47 prefectures; and (3) genome-wide SNP data of two Yaponesians (Ainu, Okinawa) and whole-genome sequence data of Yamato individuals. the Funadomari Jomon F23 individual, and three East Asian populations (Korean, northern Chinese, and southern Chinese). Past population size change was estimated based on dataset 1, and we clearly observed a steep population increase after the Yayoi period. Principal-component analysis and phylogenetic network analysis were applied to dataset 2, and we confirmed the pattern consistent with our model. An admixture program was used on dataset 3, and we found that the two- and three-layer migration models are both compatible with these SNP data. Taken together, these three datasets provide support for our three-wave, `inner dual-structure' model.",Yaponesia Genome Project; mitochondrial DNA; population size changes; three-wave migration model; inner dual-structure model,2021,129,"1, SI",10.1537/ase.201217,0918-7960,14,96,171,1174,5,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,"New hominoid mandible from the early Late Miocene Irrawaddy Formation in Tebingan area, central Myanmar","A new mediwn-sized hominoid mandibular fossil was discovered at an early Late Miocene site, Tebingan area, south of Magway city, central Myanmar. The specimen is a left adult mandibular corpus preserving strongly worn M-2 and M-3, fragmentary roots of P-4 and M-1 alveoli of canine and P-3, and the lower half of the mandibular symphysis. In Southeast Asia, two Late Miocene medium-sized hominoids have been discovered so far: Lufengpithecus from the Yunnan Province, southern China, and Khoratpithecus from northern Thailand and central Myanmar. In particular, the mandibular specimen of Khoratpithecus was discovered from the neighboring village of Tebingan. However, the new mandible shows apparent differences from both genera in the shape of the outline of the mandibular symphyseal section. The new Tebingan mandible has a well-developed superior transverse torus, a deep intertoral sulcus (= genioglossal fossa), and a thin, shelf-like inferior transverse torus. In contrast, Lufengpithecus and Khoratpithecus each have very shallow intertoral sulcus and a thick, rounded inferior transverse torus. The characteristic morphology of the mandibular symphysis in the Tebingan specimen suggests a different taxon from Khoratpithecus.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,Prevalence of dental caries and antemortem tooth loss at Pacopampa in an initial stage of social stratification in Peru's northern highlands,"This study examined the occurrence of carious lesions and antemortem tooth loss (AMTL) in skeletal remains from Pacopampa, a Formative period site in Peru. We sought to identify variations in carious lesions and AMTL within and between groups to uncover insights into social stratification and subsistence. Targets were permanent teeth and alveoli from skeletal remains from the Pacopampa I (1200-700 BCE) and Pacopampa II (700-400 BCE) phases. In this study, rates of carious lesions and AMTL, were analyzed in relation to cultural phase, age, sex, and burial type. The results revealed that rates varied by age (AMTL rates increased with age), sex (females exhibited higher carious and AMTL rates than males), and burial type (individuals buried with precious goods demonstrated lower carious and AMTL rates than other individuals). It is concluded that skeletal remains from the early stages of Andean social stratification revealed significant variations in dental caries and AMTL across cultural and biological factors. This study identified differences in the appearance of carious lesions and AMTL rates during the emergence of social stratification in the Central Andes in the Fonnative period. Future studies that explore diet using stable isotopic data are needed to test the assumption that variations in dental caries and AMTL are related to dietary patterns.",dental caries; antemortem tooth loss; dental wear; social stratification; Andean civilization,2021,129,"2, SI",10.1537/ase.210505,0918-7960,21,140,209,1371,5,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

The complexity and development of the society that then developed in the region have been explained by social networks enabled by the use of the llama as a cargo animal. However, the actual use of domesticated camelids in the Formative Period remains unclear. This study analyzed camelid skeletal remains excavated from the Pacopampa site (1200-400 BC) to provide information on the actual use of these animals. Osteometry determined the camelid to be llama; alpaca was not identified in the samples. Body part frequency, butchering mark distribution, and mortality profile revealed ritual consumption of the meaty part of young individuals. Four sacrificed immature llamas were detected. In contrast to the great similarity with the consumption process of artiodactyls' only llamas were sacrificed, while deer were not targeted. Although them were no features in the animal bone material indicating the use of secondary products, the increasing number of artifacts related to textile production suggest the fiber might be the result of llama herding.",Formative Period; herding; Peru; sacrifice; South American camelid,2021,129,"2, SI",10.1537/ase.2104111,0918-7960,17,108,171,1120,5,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

The Valley of the Nobles houses the tombs of ancient aristocratic families, which include the monumental complex of the Neferhotep tomb, catalogued as TT49 (XVIIIth Dynasty). The funerary monument of Neferhotep also includes tombs TT187, TT347, TT348, TT362, and TT363, although tombs TT347, TT348 (Ramessid Period), and TT363 (XIXth Dynasty) remain closed. Tombs TT49, TT187, and TT362 contained numerous human remains in different states of conservation. Those in tomb TT187 were attributable to at least 71 individuals, who showed evident signs of combustion, and also taphonomic alterations that had occurred in recent decades. The context of tomb TT362 was different, as it contained animal and human mummified remains that were disarticulated and showed few signs of exposure to high temperatures. These remains were attributable to 64 individuals. Tomb TT49 contained the remains of a single individual inside the burial chamber.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,The time-dependent evolutionary rate of mitochondrial DNA in small mammals inferred from biogeographic calibration points with reference to the late Quaternary environmental changes in the Japanese archipelago,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences have long been the most popular marker for assessing phylogenetic relationships and uncovering population dynamics. However. the mechanism of the nucleotide substitution rate of mtDNA remains unclear. While the evolutionary rate over tens of thousands of years is thought to be time dependent, the overall picture is not fully understood. This article presents recent achievements related to the time-dependent evolutionary rate of mtDNA in small rodents in the Japanese archipelago. The method focuses on rapid expansion events during the late Quaternary, during which there was a prolonged severe cold period and repeated abrupt warm periods, providing multiple calibration points. The global sea level fluctuation and migration to islands help to specify the calibration points. For calibration points at 11000, 15000, 53000., and 130000 years ago, the evolutionary rates were approximately 0.11, 0.11, 0.047, and 0.029 substitutions/site/million years, respectively, in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Cytb). Applying the higher rate to assess the evolutionary history of the commensal house mouse (Alus musculus) and complete mitochondrial genome sequences (similar to 16000 bp) allowed us to trace prehistoric human culture development based on millet and rice agriculture. The pattern of time-dependent evolutionary rates presented here is likely applicable to other small rodents. The Japanese archipelago is ideal for assessing evolutionary rates with biogeographic calibration points in the late Quaternary in species with multiple genetically distinct local populations.",land bridge; mitochondrial DNA; murine rodents; Quaternary glacial maximum; time-dependent evolutionary rate,2021,129,"1, SI",10.1537/ase.201201,0918-7960,27,209,228,1622,5,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

In this region, the earliest known lithic remains comprise simple cores and flakes recovered from the Siwalik Hills. The Siwalik Hills are the foothills of the southern edge of the Himalayas, and area goldmine zone for Soanian lithic implements. Although Acheulean remains have also been reported, their occurrences are few. Nevertheless. these remains have been known date from the Pleistocene, which shows varied patterns of land use and intraregional versatility. In the Siwalik Hills, Soanian implements are of two kinds: (i) a chopper type of the Lower Paleolithic period and (ii) a flake type belonging to the Middle Paleolithic period. The present study was undertaken at a newly discovered Stone Age locality, Bam, located within the frontal range of the Siwalik Hills in the Bilaspur district of Himachal Pradesh, India.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,A stabilized maternal mortality rate estimator for biased skeletal samples,"This paper seeks to provide a stabilized (i.e. less vulnerable to differences in sex representation) equation for estimating maternal mortality for biased skeletal samples. The stabilized equation is developed and tested on the United Nations data used to develop the original method (McFadden and Oxenham, Current Anthropology, 60(1), 141-146), and is applied to 16 bioarchaeological samples from mainland Southeast Asia. First-order correlations and basic descriptive statistics were applied to the data. The stabilized equation was comparable in accuracy to the original equation. When applied to bioarchaeological samples, it proved to be advantageous where the sex ratio differed by more than 0.15 in either direction (i.e. more females or more males). The stabilized equation is an improvement over the original equation for samples that exhibit sex bias that is randomly distributed by age.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,"Analysis of ancient human mitochondrial DNA from Verteba Cave, Ukraine: insights into the Late Neolithic-Chalcolithic Cucuteni-Tripolye culture","Verteba Cave (VC) in western Ukraine dates to the Eneolithic period (c. 5500 YBP), and contains the largest collection yet found of human skeletal remains associated with the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture. The subsistence economy of this people was based on agropastoralism, and included some of the largest and densest Middle Neolithic settlement sites in all of Europe. To understand further the evolutionary history of the Tripolye people, we examined population genetics patterns in mitochondrial DNA from ancient human remains excavated from VC chambers. From five commingled and secondary burial sites within the cave, we obtained 368 bp mtDNA HVR1 sequences from 22 individuals assignable to eight haplogroups: H (three haplotypes), HV (two haplotypes), W, K, and T. Overall nucleotide diversity is low (pi = 0.00621). The two largest samples, from Chamber G3 and Site 7, were significantly differentiated with respect to haplotype composition: G3 (n = 8) is dominated by haplotype W (pi = 0), whereas Site 7 (n = 15) is dominated by H haplotypes (pi = 0.00439). Tajima's D as an indication of population expansion was not significantly negative for the complete sample (D = -1.37) or for sites G3 (D = -0.973) and 7 (D = -1.35), which were analyzed separately. Individuals from the Tripolye culture buried at VC c. 5500 YBP had predominantly haplogroup H and related haplotypes. This contrasts with predominantly haplogroup U individuals in preEneolithic peoples from the same area, which suggests lack of genetic continuity in a site that has been dated to the Mesolithic.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,Ancestry estimation using image analysis of orbital shapes from Thai and Japanese skulls,"The orbital shape is one of the most ambiguous features for morphological study in ancestry estimation. Recent research has used digital image analysis to obtain more objective and better results. The aim of this study was to create a method and formula to determine ancestry using image analysis of orbital shapes from skulls of Thai and Japanese individuals. This pilot study applied two-dimensional digital image processing techniques to analyze 440 skulls comprising 220 modern Thai and 220 modern Japanese samples of known identities. The image analysis involved four steps: pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Five shape measurements of both the left and right orbital rims were selected and a formula was derived using multivariate discriminant analysis. Another set of 68 Thai and Japanese skulls was used as a blind test set for accuracy. The formula had a predicted and cross-validated accuracy of 80.7\% and a tested accuracy of 86.8\%.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE,Bioarchaeology of human skeletons from an elite tomb at Pacopampa in Peru's northern highlands,"The Pacopampa site is one of the largest Formative Period sites in Peru's northern highlands. This study describes newly excavated human remains from the site, compares them with previous findings, and provides bioarchaeological approaches to assess social stratification in Formative Period Andes, leading to an understanding of how social stratification emerged in the Andean civilization. The human remains studied were two individuals from an elite tomb (the `Serpent-Jaguar Priests' tomb) at the ceremonial center of the site. At the bottom of the tomb, a middle-aged female was laid over the remains of a young male. The central position of the tomb and the rich repertoire of grave goods suggest that these individuals had symbolic importance and belonged to an elite social group. The possible presence of artificial cranial deformation in the female suggests that the buried individuals were socially different from the other burial individuals of this site. There is no dental caries in these two individuals. The comparison of caries frequencies between these two individuals and non-elites showed lower caries frequencies in the former than in the latter. Taking into consideration existing isotopic data of Formative Period sites, the social differences in the caries frequencies can be attributed to the elites' dietary patterns-which contained fewer cariogenic foods.

The average shift speed of the core range -9.05 m/decade downward and that for total range is 17.15 m/decade upward across climate change scenarios. This study indicates that the response of total range and core distribution range to climate change is not synchronous. Considering poleward or northward shift will underestimate about 2.2-20.1\% for total range and 21.2-56.3\% for core range. Thus, the study have important guiding significance for determining the potential shift route and adjust the shift speed for planting the tree species in response to future climate change.

APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,CONVERSION OF WETLANDS TO FARMLAND AND FORESTS REDUCES SOIL MICROBIAL FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AND CARBON USE INTENSITY,"Changes in land use types typically lead to changes in soil ecosystem functions, and soil microorganisms can sensitively reflect soil quality and the evolution of different ecosystem functions. To characterize the impact of land use changes on the microbial function of wetlands, our study assessed three typical land use types (wetland, farmland, and forest land) in the Sanjiang Plain, and Biolog microplate technology was used to study the changes in the use intensity and functional diversity of different soil microbial carbon sources, as well as their relationship with soil physicochemical properties. Our findings indicated that the physical and chemical properties of soil changed significantly in different land use types (P < 0.05). The functional diversity and carbon source metabolism of wetland soil were significantly higher than those of farmland and forest. Furthermore, the utilization intensity of compound carbon sources was significantly higher than that of forests and farmland, whereas amino acids, esters, alcohols, amines, and acid carbon sources did not change significantly. Soil water content, total phosphorus, organic carbon, available phosphorus, and other physical and chemical factors affected soil microbial function in different land use types.

APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,DETERMINATION OF THE CRITICAL PERIOD OF WEED CONTROL (CPWC) TO INCREASE THE YIELD OF BARLEY (HORDEUM VULGARE L.) CROP IN EGYPT,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different weed competition periods on the growth and yield of an Egyptian barley crop under field conditions, as well as to estimate the critical period of weed control (CPWC) in barley. The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications (i.e., plots 4 x 4 m each) and consisted of a quantitative series of both increasing duration of weed interference and length of weed-free periods. The measured morphological parameters of barley plants were greater in non-weedy barley fields than in weedy barley fields. The shoot height of non-weedy barley plants was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of weedy plants. After 75 DAE (Days After Emergence) of weed infestation, the maximum height and plant density were obtained. The biomass of barley plants and their associated weeds was gradually increased until 45 DAE, when barley biomass continued to increase, while weed biomass decreased. The maximum barley yield in the weed-free plots was 3.2 t ha(-1) after 90 DAE, while it was 2.2 t ha(-1) in the weed-infested plots after 75 DAE. Based on a 10\% yield loss, the CPWC fell between 63 and 79 DAE, while a 5\% yield loss fell between 41 and 102 DAE. Weed presence prior to and after the CPWC is not expected to reduce crop yield. As a result, weed removal at the CPWC is critical to allow plants to grow to their full potential without being hampered by competition and, hence, crop yield loss.",Barley; weed management; logistic model; yield loss; experimental design,2022,20,5,10.15666/aeer/2005\_43214338,1589-1623,21,126,255,1497,5,14,200,5,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,DISTRIBUTIONAL RANGE SHIFTS IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE: A CASE STUDY OF CONIFER SPECIES ENDEMIC TO SOUTHWESTERN CHINA,"Climate change is widely expected to influence geographic distribution and range shifts of plant species. Southwestern China, which has been identified as one of the global biodiversity hotspots, is experiencing a warming trend that is well above the global average. Pinus yunnanensis is a mountainous conifer species endemic to southwestern China. However, little is known about its specific responses to future climate change. Here, based on a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model, we integrated environmental factors, bioclimatic variables, and species occurrence data from extensive field surveys to project the potential suitable habitats of P. yunnanensis for the years 2050 and 2090 under two climate scenarios. According to our projections, P. yunnanensis generally experienced a suitable habitat loss in the coming decades, and there was a clear acceleration of habitat loss with the severity of climate scenarios. Moreover, the suitable habitat of P. yunnanensis showed a slight southward and downslope shift in response to climate change. Our results indicated that temperature-related factors and solar radiation, especially temperature seasonality, lowest temperature in the coldest month, and mean diurnal range, performed better than precipitation and topo-soil factors in explaining species distributional dynamics. In addition, we identified southern Sichuan and north-central Yunnan as long-term refuges for P. yunnanensis under future climate change, while southeastern Tibet should be protected as a priority conservation area.

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,Best practice-Is natural revegetation sufficient to achieve mitigation goals in road construction?,"Aims The area influenced by road construction is large, and measures to re-establish vegetation in disturbed areas are routinely carried out to reduce impacts on biodiversity. However, goals of mitigation measures are often unclear, and the effects on biodiversity of mitigation measures is rarely monitored. We assessed the effects of different revegetation treatments (natural revegetation, seeding, planting) on vegetation development along highways, and on wildlife crossings of different age. Location Highways in southeast Norway. Methods We collected data on vascular plant species, vegetation cover and height, soil grain size and organic matter content, and compared the species composition, richness, and diversity of the restored sites with reference plots in the adjacent target vegetation (mature forest). Results Our results show a significantly higher richness and diversity in restored plots compared to reference plots, and an increased similarity of species composition over time. Species composition was most similar to reference plots in naturally revegetated plots and seeding seemed to reduce both species and functional trait composition similarity. Conclusions It is unrealistic that the defined target vegetation will develop on restored sites. Defining a realistic and achievable target vegetation for each road construction project in relation to land use, adjacent vegetation type and successional stage, as e.g., forest edge instead of forest, would be useful.

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,Classification of rocky outcrops plant communities in the mountains of Central Argentina,"Aims Classification of plant communities and identification of their diagnostic species in different types of rocky outcrops in mountains from Central Argentina. We also explored how these plant communities differ in their endemisms, chorotypes and non-natives species composition, as well as in rock chemistry, elevation and climatic variables. Location Cordoba Province, Central Argentina. Methods The study was based on 505 phytosociological releves collected from 2009 to 2019 using the Braun-Blanquet cover-abundance scale. The hierarchical ISOmetric feature mapping and Partition Around Medoids (ISOPAM) analysis was applied. The vegetation matrix was ordinated through isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP), and the geochemical and bioclimatic variables were related to the ISOMAP ordination. Results We identified 14 plant communities distributed in three main clusters. We recorded 59 endemic species at the national level and 28 narrow endemics, restricted to the study area and nearby mountains. The number of non-native plants was relatively low (26 species). Perennial herbs (221 species), grasses (97 species) and shrubs (68 species) were the most prominent life forms. Plant communities were associated with rock chemistry (carbonate and acidic rocks), and also with elevation and climatic variables. Conclusion This study highlights the remarkable heterogeneity of outcrop vegetation in Central Argentina. It reveals that elevation and rock type (geochemical composition) were relevant factors associated with the floristic composition of plant communities and also, that outcrop habitats comprise a high level of endemisms, as well as a low number of non-native species, suggesting a high value for the conservation of local and regional biodiversity.",Chaco Serrano; chorotypes; elevation; endemism; rock chemistry; rocky outcrops; vegetation classification,2022,25,4,10.1111/avsc.12686,1402-2001,12,88,249,1765,7,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,Cryptogams and dwarf evergreen shrubs are vulnerable to nitrogen addition in a boreal permafrost peatland of Northeast China,"Aim Boreal peatlands are very sensitive to nitrogen (N) enrichment due to the low soil N availability. Our aim was to reveal how increased N availability altered plant composition in boreal permafrost peatlands with dense vascular plants (>50\%). Location Greater Khingan Mountains, Northeast China. Methods A nitrogen addition experiment with four N addition levels (0, 3, 6, and 12 g N m(-2) year(-1)) was conducted in a poor fen in the continuous permafrost zone with vascular plant coverage above 60\%. Plant diversity, community composition, and above-ground biomass were investigated after four, six, and eight years of N addition. Results Nitrogen addition decreased species richness and diversity but enhanced total above-ground biomass. Plant height determined the plants' responses to N addition, and the magnitudes increased with N addition level and experimental duration. The relative coverage of high-stature (>50 cm) species increased, but the relative coverage of low-stature (<50 cm) species decreased with elevating N addition levels. When N addition proceeded, the relative coverage and above-ground biomass of tall deciduous shrubs and nitrophilous grasses increased, whereas the relative coverage and above-ground biomass of dwarf evergreen shrubs, mosses, and lichens declined. Regardless of N addition levels, cryptogams (i.e., mosses and lichens) and a dwarf evergreen shrub (Chamaedaphne calyculata) disappeared after eight-year N addition. Conclusions Cryptogams and dwarf evergreen shrubs are highly vulnerable to increased N availability, and N enrichment-induced biodiversity loss, especially the disappearance of cryptogams, will deteriorate ecosystem structure and function in boreal permafrost peatlands.",biodiversity loss; light competition; minerotrophic poor fen; nitrogen enrichment; sphagnum mosses,2022,25,4,10.1111/avsc.12691,1402-2001,18,124,243,1736,5,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,Deferment associated to contrasting grazing intensities affects root/shoot biomass allocation in natural grasslands,"Questions (i) How does a strategic deferment influence both shoot and root biomass in South American Campos natural grassland after a long time of contrasting livestock grazing intensities? (ii) How do functional strategies of plants to tolerate or avoid grazing affect patterns of aboveground and belowground biomass? Location A natural Campos grassland in the Central Depression of Rio Grande do Sul State, Southern Brazil (latitude 30 degrees 05 ` 27 `' S, longitude 51 degrees 40 ` 18 `' W, and altitude 46 m). Methods We studied the effects of deferments (spring or autumn) at moderate and severe livestock grazing intensities (maintained by adjusting contrasting forage allowances during 25 years) on the cover of dominant species, and aboveground and belowground biomass. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with three replications of grazing exclusions, applied simultaneously at moderate and severe grazing intensities. Measurements of above- and belowground biomass and the coverage of the five dominant species were performed before and after grazing exclusion periods. Results Under severe grazing intensity, erect-growing grasses were replaced by prostrate species, which were able at least to maintain the belowground biomass found at moderate grazing intensity. In response to deferments, severe grazing intensity changed toward a significant increase in aboveground biomass and in the coverage of plants with erect growing habit. However, total belowground biomass remained unaffected by exclusions in both grazing intensities. The relation of root:shoot biomass was lower under moderate grazing intensity, and showed a negative response to deferment treatments at severe grazing intensity. Conclusion Long-term contrasting grazing intensities applied in South American Campos grasslands determine several changes in above- and belowground relationships. Prevalence of prostrate plants under severe grazing is associated with a high partitioning capacity of assimilates toward the subterranean biomass, higher than in the tall species predominant under moderate grazing. The fast recovery of aboveground biomass, the maintenance of the underground biomass and the increase of tall grasses in response to deferments reveals the high resilience capacity of this ecosystem after a long-term period of overgrazing.",aboveground biomass; botanical composition; long-term experiment; root; shoot biomass,2022,25,3,10.1111/avsc.12671,1402-2001,13,115,338,2352,5,NA,300,10,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,Embedding trait-based ecology within indigenous knowledge to advance sustainable management of Tibetan rangeland,"Questions Traditional pastoralists attribute high numbers of plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) to impoverished soils that favor more and better forage for pika, suggesting a bottom-up control of pika density. Conversely, government policies focus on excessive numbers of this small mammalian herbivore as the primary top-down cause of degradation in Tibetan rangeland. Despite concerted campaigns to reduce pika abundance in recent decades, the sustainability of Tibetan rangelands remains uncertain. Location Alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. Methods We proposed a conceptual model based on indigenous knowledge that predicted pika numbers from soil condition and plant traits. At three alpine meadow sites lightly grazed by livestock, we tested whether spatial variation in pika burrow density could be explained by changes in the functional composition of the plant community attributable to species turnover and intraspecific trait variation associated with changes in soil fertility. Results Due primarily to intraspecific trait variation, changes in the functional composition of the meadow community accounted for 56\%-68\% of the spatial variation in pika density, changes in the proportion of plant functional groups for 62\%-74\%, and changes in edaphic conditions for 71\%-82\%. Greater pika density was associated with a decline in soil phosphorus availability and a lower-growing vegetation profile enriched in both the quantity and quality of forage preferred by pikas. Conclusions These results, which are in accord with indigenous knowledge, suggest that compensating soil phosphorus losses and maintaining a well-calibrated grazing rotation can better manage pika populations and improve the sustainability of Tibetan rangelands. By combining trait-based ecology and traditional knowledge, our study provides new insight into both understanding the dynamic complexity of grazing regimes and managing rangeland sustainability.",community functional composition; functional traits; intraspecific trait variation; plateau pika; soil phosphorus; sustainability,2022,25,4,10.1111/avsc.12687,1402-2001,13,112,271,1948,6,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,Grassland restoration on former arable land: Fine-scale grass accumulation and damaged soil conditions limit species establishment,"Question Which vegetation and soil parameters limit species establishment in restored grasslands? Do these parameters operate predominantly on a fine or a community scale? Location White Carpathian Mountains, SE Czech Republic. Methods We compared 16 grasslands restored on former arable land with 9 well-preserved reference grasslands. We sampled cover of plant species in plots of 2 m x 2 m (community scale) in which four 20 cm x 20 cm subplots (fine scale) were nested. We quantified fine-scale heterogeneity as the mean Sorensen dissimilarity index among the species composition of the subplots. To characterize site conditions, we analyzed soil properties, above-ground plant biomass and its nutrient content. Results Restored grasslands had a lower number of plant species at both the community and fine scales. Species number at the community scale was positively associated with the species number at the fine scale (irrespective of grassland type), but was not associated with fine-scale heterogeneity. This indicates the importance of fine-scale biotic interactions for overall species diversity. In support of this, in both grassland types, the species number was negatively associated with the cover of grasses, but only at the fine scale. Total cover (but not the biomass) was lower in restored grasslands, and was positively related with species number, particularly in restored grasslands. This indicates that the lower species number in the restored grasslands mainly resulted from deteriorated abiotic conditions. Such deterioration of the plant environment can be attributed particularly to the soil of the restored, formerly plowed grasslands. They had a lower soil organic matter content and a higher proportion of fine soil particles (silt and clay), indicating reduced soil water availability. The lower soil N content of restored grasslands was also reflected in the nutrient content of plant biomass, where lower N:P and N:K ratios indicated a limitation of plant growth by N-supply. Conclusion The species number was generally driven by fine-scale biotic interactions, which operated similarly in both grassland types. The reduced number of plant species in restored grasslands is the result of several factors among which altered soil conditions in the former arable land appears to be highly important.",fine and community scale; grass cover; grassland restoration; plant-plant interactions; plant-soil interactions; soil properties; White Carpathians,2022,25,2,10.1111/avsc.12665,1402-2001,16,130,351,2330,7,NA,300,10,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,Increased diversity of the species pool via seeding augments establishment of native species in experimental vacant-lot restorations,"Question The harsh geophysical template characterized by the urban environment combined with people's choices has led ecologists to invoke environmental filtering as the main ecological phenomenon explaining urban biodiversity patterns. Yet, dispersal is often overlooked as a driving factor, especially on expanding vacant land. Does overcoming dispersal limitation by seeding native species in urban environments and increasing the functional or phylogenetic diversity of the seeding pool increase native plant species diversity and abundance in urban vacant land? Location Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Methods We took an experimental approach to learn how different dimensions of plant biodiversity within a regional species pool augmented via seed additions, can explain variation in community structure over a three-year period. Vacant lots were cleared and manipulated with seeding treatments of high or low phylogenetic and functional diversities from a pool of 28 native species. Establishment success, total native cover and native-species richness were followed and compared to cleared, unseeded control lots as well as unmanipulated lots. Results Seeding increased native plant abundance and richness over uncleared plots, as well as cleared and unseeded control plots. Phylogenetically diverse seed mixtures had greater establishment success than mixtures composed of closely related species. Diversifying seed mixtures increased the likelihood of including species that are better able to establish on vacant land. However, there were no differences in varying levels of either functional or phylogenetic diversity. Conclusions Augmenting the regional species pool via diverse seed mixtures can enhance native plant cover and richness under the harsh environmental conditions conferred by land abandonment.",dispersal; functional diversity; phylogenetic diversity; seeding regime; urban ecosystems; vacant land,2022,25,4,10.1111/avsc.12692,1402-2001,17,132,252,1816,6,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,Observer-driven pseudoturnover in vegetation monitoring is context-dependent but does not affect ecological inference,"Aims Resurveys of vegetation plots are prone to several errors that can result in misleading conclusions. Minimizing such errors and finding alternative approaches for analyzing resurvey data are therefore important. We focused on inter-observer error and excluded other sources of variation. Our main questions were: How large is the inter-observer error (i.e. pseudoturnover) in vegetation surveys, and can it be reduced by simple data aggregation approaches? Which factors are affecting pseudoturnover and does it vary between morphological species groups or change over time? Is ecological inference robust against inter-observer differences? Location Switzerland. Methods Over seven years, we double-surveyed a total of 224 plots that were marked once in the field and then sampled by two observers independently on the same day. Both observers conducted full vegetation surveys, recording all vascular plant species, their cover, and additional plot information. We then calculated mean ecological indicator values and pseudoturnover. Results Average pseudoturnover was 29\% when raw species lists were compared. However, by applying simple aggregation steps to the species list, pseudoturnover was reduced to 17\%. Pseudoturnover further varied among habitat types and declined over the years, indicating a training effect among observers. Most overlooked taxa, responsible for pseudoturnover, had low cover values. Mean ecological indicator values were robust against inter-observer differences. Conclusions To minimize pseudoturnover, we suggest continuous training of observers and species-list aggregation prior to analysis. As mean ecological indicator values were robust against inter-observer differences, we conclude that they can provide a reliable estimate of temporal vegetation and ecological changes.",dry grassland; ecological indicator value; fen; flood plain; inter-observer difference; long-term biodiversity monitoring; observer error; pseudoturnover; raised bog; vegetation survey,2022,25,3,10.1111/avsc.12669,1402-2001,13,117,250,1820,10,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,Propagation distance thresholds of woody Cerrado species in a pasture matrix,"Question: Is there a decrease in the richness, structural variables and composition similarity of woody Cerrado species with habitat-matrix distance, potentially influenced by soil compaction and propagule dispersal strategies in the pasture matrix? Location: We studied three landscapes of a pasture matrix in areas of the Cerrado biome in southwestern Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We sampled 110 plots of 2 m x 2 m in the matrix, stratified in ranges perpendicular to the edge of the habitat, and 10 plots in the forest with no edge effect (60 m from the edge). We undertook soil sampling and collected information about the plants (taxonomy, height, circumference and establishment form by germination or resprouting). We defined habitat distance as the predictor variable for the following response variables: abundance, richness, establishment form, mean height, mean diameter at soil height and dispersal syndrome of the individuals sampled; in addition to the porosity and bulk density of the sampled soil. Results: We found significant differences between habitat and matrix for abundance, richness, mean height and germination number, but non-significant differences for resprouting number and mean diameter at soil height. There was no relationship regarding matrix-habitat distances for structural variables, and habitat species composition was similar only for the first 10 m distance from the habitat edge. Conclusion: Pasture did not prevent plant establishment but might act as an environmental filter. Pasture matrices modify the composition and diversity of the plant community compared with the Cerrado community. Pastures are dominated by resprouting, autochory and grassland species.

Two non-operculate species, Indoplanorbis exustus, and Racesina luteola and five operculate species, namely Pila globosa, Filopaludina bengalensis, Gabbia orcula, Melanoides tuberculata, and Brotia costula were considered for the experiment extending for a period of 28-days. Grazing, burrowing and bulldozing activities of snails on sediments bed induced changes in physicochemical properties of substratum and modulated the organic mineralization process. All seven snail species increased NH4+-N and PO43--P flux from sediment to overlying water in comparison with the control. Moreover, in snail presence modulated NOX- (NO2- -N + NO3- -N) concentrations and other parameters (DO, pH, TDS, conductivity) to the column water. Snail activity induced changes in physicochemical properties (TN, AP, OC, porosity and WHC) of sediment and modulated the organic mineralization process based on the length of the snails. The sediment texture was changed, more prominently in presence of the operculate snails than the non-operculate snails. Apparently, the operculate benthic snail F. bengalensis induced greater changes in the sediment in comparison to other snails.

Coral cover decreased by 93\% and coral diversity by six-fold. This phenomenon has resulted from a long-term outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster sp. (COTS) reinforced by sea surface temperature anomalies in June 2019. The last survey, conducted in the target monitoring site in May 2021, revealed that the outbreak of COTS had ceased together with the disappearance of food sources for this starfish. Predator removal caused by overfishing and to some degree, nutrient enrichment resulting from the local seasonal upwelling, apparently determined the extent of the COTS outbreak.

AQUATIC ECOLOGY,The energetic cost of facing cyanotoxins: a case study on Daphnia magna,"Under the effects of global change, toxic cyanobacterial proliferations increase and subsequently threaten freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide. Zooplankton consumers, a key trophic level of freshwater ecosystems, are particularly impaired by cyanotoxins, but populations regularly exposed to cyanobacteria can develop tolerance against toxins. While the physiological processes involved in this tolerance have been extensively studied, their consequences for consumers' energetics remain poorly explored, impeding predictions of energy flow from zooplankton up to higher trophic levels. Here, we explored the metabolic response of Daphnia magna exposed to toxic and non-toxic strains of cyanobacteria to define the energy dedicated to cyanotoxins resistance mechanisms. We showed that resting metabolic rate (RMR) of individuals exposed to toxins increased by up to 60\%, reflecting the energy requirement involved by cyanotoxin resistance processes. By quantifying the energy dedicated to resistance mechanisms, RMR constitutes an interesting metric to estimate overall capacity of individual zooplankters to actively handle cyanotoxins. Moreover, RMR responds more promptly to cyanotoxins than growth thus being adequate to assess short-term cyanotoxins constraints (< 72 h). Overall, we showed that cyanotoxins resistance constitutes an energy leak in freshwater ecosystems. Quantifying this leak of energy may help anticipate alterations of energy flow within food web in response to cyanobacterial proliferation and, ultimately, enhance our predictions of freshwater ecosystem structure and functions in a context of global change.",Daphnia magna; Metabolism; Cyanobacteria; Toxins; Freshwater,2023,57,1,10.1007/s10452-022-09990-6,1386-2588,12,71,223,1652,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

To illustrate the temporal and spatial variation in the main colony characteristics for Microcystis and their key environmental factors in Lake Taihu, an annual investigation of the size, morphospecies and viability (the viable cell rate) of Microcystis colonies was performed in this study from 2020 to 2021. The average colony diameter ranged from 81.12 to 499.54 mu m at all sites during this investigation. The average colony diameter of the whole lake in spring and in late autumn to early winter was higher than that in other times. Microcystis flos-quae, Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis novacekii and Microcystis wesenbergii were the main dominant morphotypes, which was mainly affected by pH, TDP and temperature.

AQUATIC ECOLOGY,A trait-based perspective toward the mechanistic understanding of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage in a tropical rice field,"Approximately 15\% of the world's wetlands are rice fields, vital in providing food for 40\% of the human population. Due to farming practices-induced habitat disturbances, rice cultivation acts as a habitat filter that retains only taxa possessing specific traits to overcome the constraints. Being aquatic biota, benthic macroinvertebrates are also impacted by the intermittent presence of water in rice fields. The biological traits and trait combinations of benthic macroinvertebrates enabling their existence during the rice cultivation cycle in seasonal rice fields of Maranchery Kole (The Ramsar site Vembanad Kole wetland's part) were studied. Based on the literature, 63 categories of 11 biological traits assignable at the genus level were used to characterize benthic macroinvertebrates. The taxa by traits data matrix was subjected to Gower's distance-based hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis to categorize faunal groups with similar trait assembly. According to the abundance weighted trait modality scores, the predominant traits were small body size, life duration of more than 1 year, multivoltine life cycle, aquatic larval stage, aquatic passive dispersal, cocoons as resistant form, locomotion by full water swimming, tegumental respiration, asexual reproduction, detritus as food and deposit-feeding. Trait-based classification of taxa resulted in 5 clusters. Characteristic trait combinations in each cluster particularly those beneficial for survival in unstable lentic freshwaters enabled the existence of taxa. Cluster I, the most abundant group (oligochaetes), was benefited from trait combinations including resistance forms to survive the intermittent presence of water in rice fields. Asexual reproduction and early onset of reproduction ensured their higher abundance from the transplanting phase. Detrital feeding also facilitated their rapid buildup in newly flooded fields rich in decomposing detritus. Cluster groups II and III, actively flying colonists characterized by competitive traits like predation, were more in tillering and preharvest phases. Apart from resistant and resilient traits ensuring survival in the temporary and disturbed habitat, exclusive trait combinations favored the faunal groups through different phases.",Biological traits; Rice cultivation; Temporary aquatic phase; Vembanad Kole,2022,56,4,10.1007/s10452-022-09984-4,1386-2588,16,127,314,2275,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
AQUATIC ECOLOGY,Abundance and seasonality of phoronid larvae in coastal temperate waters: More abundant than previously thought?,"In zooplankton surveys, many smaller taxa or species considered less important are often overlooked. One such example is the actinotrocha larvae of phoronid worms that are rarely quantified in zooplankton samples yet may play important roles in marine food webs. To gain a better understanding of phoronid ecology in coastal waters, we retrospectively analysed 145 plankton samples collected from two coastal sites in Ireland (Lough Hyne and Bantry Bay). Samples were collected using plankton nets from depths of 20 and 40 m. Phoronids were present in 37.7\% and 38.2\% of samples, with mean abundances of 0.3 +/- 0.5 ind. m(-3) and 1.2 +/- 2.8 ind. m(-3), respectively, and were identified as Phoronis muelleri and Phoronis hippocrepia. Phoronids were present consistently each year from April to October at Lough Hyne and from February to October at Bantry Bay. Comparisons with other taxa in Lough Hyne show that abundances are similar to those of fish larvae (1.1 +/- 1.8 ind. m(-3)) and echinoderm larvae (2.3 +/- 4.4 ind. m(-3)). Examination of these samples from Irish waters suggests that phoronids are more abundant in temperate waters than previously reported.",Phoronida; Biodiversity; Marine protected area; Larval abundance; Plankton sampling,2022,56,4,10.1007/s10452-022-09982-6,1386-2588,15,112,186,1170,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC ECOLOGY,Causes of aquatic ecosystem degradation related to tourism and the feasibility of restoration for karst nature reserves,"Tourism remains one of the top threats in nature reserves worldwide. In this study, we first used both a field survey and in situ nutrient enrichment experiments to assess the effects of tourisms on aquatic ecosystems in a World Natural Heritage site that includes lakes, streams, shoals, and waterfalls. The results showed that phosphorus (P) enrichment altered benthic algal assemblage composition and the color of bryophyte-dominated benthic substrates in a shoal. Epilithic diatoms and their responses to the nutrient addition were significantly different between the control and test sites on a lake, which had contrasting tourist impacts in a lake. Second, we assessed the resilience of a lake heavily visited in the reserve by comparing phytoplankton density before and after a 2-year reserve closure due to an earthquake. Our study confirmed the hypotheses: (1) the perceived color change in Jiuzhaigou Natural Reserve waters was caused by nutrient enrichment in relation to tourist activities and was closely associated with a shift in algal composition; and (2) the changes to the fluvial and lake systems are still at their early stages and could be recovered by reducing tourism pressure. Our findings provide managers of protected karstic nature reserves with critical information for identifying causes of reserve degradation, estimating the carrying capacity for tourism and establishing limits of acceptable ecosystem changes.

AQUATIC ECOLOGY,Determinant factors of diatom assemblage's distribution along the Coastal Central Constantine (Northeastern Algeria),"The present study is based on the identification of benthic diatoms sampled along the Coastal Central Constantine in northeastern of Algeria. Our work aims to address relationships between environmental variables and characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the diatom flora. Diatoms and samples for physicochemical analysis were collected from 26 sampling sites between May 2017 and August 2018. The number of species accounted for was 109 species in the Safsaf watershed, 117 taxa in the Kebir and 129 species in the watershed of Guebli which was the most diversified catchment. The great majority of diatom taxa were cosmopolitan species. Naviculaceae were the most abundant (47.87\%). Our results demonstrated the main environmental variables controlling the diatom distribution in all the watersheds, including conductivity, and pollution gradients highlighted in Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA). The results of the Shannon diversity index (H') showed that the species diversity observed in the sampled sites during summer is higher than that observed in spring and winter. During this season, mean Shannon diversity values were around H' = 4.49, 3.98, and 4.17, respectively, while species richness varied between 13 and 34 across the three watersheds.",Benthic diatoms; Canonical correspondence analysis; Diversity indices; Environmental gradients,2022,56,4,10.1007/s10452-022-09980-8,1386-2588,13,116,189,1279,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC ECOLOGY,Interaction between the thinly encrusting sponge Clathria venosa and the branched coral Acropora palmata,"Acropora palmata is colonized by encrusting sponges, such as Clathria venosa, in the lower zones of coral branches, especially in areas devoid of living tissue. To analyze the responses of tissues involved in the areas of interaction, we investigated the advancement rates and the sponge growth and recovery rates after the removal of sponge tissue. To assess the advance or retreat rates of the sponge and coral, steel screws were placed at the limits of the sponge/coral interaction area (treatment 1), and the response of the coral and sponge tissues was recorded. In treatment 2, the sponge was removed by scraping and cleaning the area. In treatment 3, the sponge was removed, and the area occupied by the sponge was filled with epoxy putty. We found that the interaction was a standoff (T1) in 64.2\% of cases, the sponge advanced in 7.1\% of cases, and regression was observed in 28.7\% of cases. Following its partial removal of the sponge (T2), C. venosa recovered the formerly occupied space in one month, whereas in T3, growth and recovery required 3 months. Clathria venosa is a colonizing species of the lower parts of the bases and branches of A. palmata, which despite presenting a rapid regeneration rate, no evidence was found that in contact with the coral, the sponge generates tissue deterioration.",Sponge; coral interactions; Standoff relationship; Coral defense; Endangered species,2022,56,4,10.1007/s10452-022-09981-7,1386-2588,14,104,219,1318,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC ECOLOGY,Negative effects of ghost nets on Mediterranean biodiversity,"Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing nets (i.e., ghost nets) strongly affect biodiversity in marine ecosystems of numerous localities around the world. Based on videos posted by different people in YouTube (TM), we accessed the negative effects of these gears in the Mediterranean Sea. We identified 86 species, from 12 groups, in 12 countries within the Mediterranean region (including in the Africa, Europe, and Asia). Of the species entangled in ghost nets, 10 are considered threatened with extinction according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Fishes and macrocrustaceans were the most recorded groups entangled in ghost nets. We also identified algae, other invertebrates (i.e., cnidarians, echinoderms, molluscs, poriferans, tunicates) and vertebrates (i.e., turtles and mammals). The larger number of ghost fishing events were recorded in Italy and Turkey. This is the most complete study showing the negative effects of ghost nets on marine biodiversity worldwide, based on data retrieved from digital media. With the available literature, our data are important to implement measures against ghost fishing nets in the Mediterranean Sea.",Cyclical catching; Digital media; Entanglement; Fishing; Megafauna; YouTube (TM),2022,NA,NA,10.1007/s10452-022-09985-3,1386-2588,8,60,173,1178,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC ECOLOGY,"Nutrient limitation of primary production in rivers along a land use gradient in the Lake Biwa Basin, Shiga Prefecture, Japan","Benthic microalgae (BMA) biomass and community structure in freshwater lotic systems are often limited by inorganic nutrient availability. We examined nutrient limitation of benthic algae biomass and community structure using nutrient diffusing substrates in four rivers along a land use gradient in the Lake Biwa basin, Japan. Ambient in-stream nutrient concentrations were correlated to catchment land use, with the highest nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations being found in rivers draining more forested catchments. Nutrient limitation of primary producer biomass and nutrient-driven changes in community structure were evident in all four rivers, regardless of in-stream nutrient concentrations and surrounding land use. BMA biomass (measured as chlorophyll log-response ratio) exhibited the greatest nutrient limitation in rivers with higher in-stream nutrient concentrations. The relationship to catchment land use was less clear, with the highest nutrient limitation being observed in the catchment with moderate amounts of agricultural and forested land use. Nutrient additions resulted in a shift from dominance by Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) to a mixed Bacillariophyceae-Chlorophyceae (chlorophyte) community in all rivers and this shift was most pronounced in the forested catchments. Changes within the diatom community with nutrient additions were also observed, although the shifts in diatom community within a river in response to nutrient additions were much smaller than the differences in diatom community composition among rivers. Diatom taxa classified as highly motile increased with nutrient additions in all rivers. Our results suggest that primary producer community in rivers may be sensitive to nutrient inputs even in areas with elevated nutrient concentrations and catchments dominated by agricultural land use. There is likely widespread nutrient limitation in rivers of Japan, across both in-stream nutrient and land use gradients and any increases in nutrient loading will likely stimulate benthic algal growth. Our findings highlight the importance of looking at both biomass and species composition to assess ecosystem-level impacts of elevated nutrient levels.",Benthic microalgae; Nutrient limitation; Primary production; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Nutrient-diffusing substrates,2022,56,4,10.1007/s10452-022-09971-9,1386-2588,20,125,306,2197,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
AQUATIC ECOLOGY,Nutritional context modulates the salinity tolerance of freshwater invertebrates,"Food quality is known as a major driver of organisms' performances, but the way it may modulate the response of consumers to environmental stressors now appears as critical issue of trophic ecology. Here we evaluated whether and how food quality mediates the salinity tolerance of the model organism Daphnia magna to assess the resistance of zooplankton populations to salinization, which constitutes a serious threat for freshwater ecosystems worldwide. We showed that diets lacking highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) and sterols reduce the salinity tolerance range of daphnids by more than 30\%. Our measurements of individual metabolic rate coupled with the quantification of consumers NaCl body content revealed that this reduction in salinity tolerance arises either from an increased energetic cost of iono-/osmo-regulation when food quality declines or from a lower resistance to NaCl when consumers lack sterols and highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA). While improving individual salt tolerance, these two mechanisms may have opposite consequences at ecosystem scale and need to be fully considered when predictions of consumers responses to multifactorial stresses are induced by global change.",Zooplankton; Daphnia magna; Freshwater; Salinization; Metabolism; Food quality,2022,56,4,10.1007/s10452-022-09975-5,1386-2588,9,80,177,1208,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC ECOLOGY,Species conservation target for freshwater fishes inhabiting Bengal sub-tropical montane rivers of Eastern Himalayas: an indexed value approach for priority determination,"Identifying conservation strategy is essential regarding prioritization, planning, and managing biodiversity. The Eastern Himalayan freshwater reaches contain diverse taxa of fish species. Despite having several coarse scales of assessment, the information regarding the fine-scale conservation priorities is scanty. The development of indices from multimeric attributes has been proved efficient, aiding conservation planning, in-depth research, exploitation, policy-making, and public awareness. Therefore, this study aims to provide detailed indexing of conservation values for the freshwater fish species inhabiting the sub-Himalayan Terai-Dooars ecoregion of the Eastern Himalayas. Based on three years of extended sampling in six freshwater reaches, 170 indigenous fish species were identified. Each fish species was assigned a discrete conservation value following their rarity, taxonomic singularity, contribution to beta diversity, global threat status, regional importance, and maximal achievable body lengths. Neolissochilus hexagonolepis has the highest conservation value. In contrast, the lowest values were observed for Pethia gelius, Pethia guganio, and Pethia phutunio. The freshwater habitats of upper and lower elevation harbor essential fish species for conservation, driven by precipitation, topographic, and land cover variability. Such results were accomplished through spatial interpolation and prioritization regarding fish conservation, protection, and vulnerability toward the human footprint for this region of the Eastern Himalayas.",Fish species conservation value; Vulnerability index; Eastern Himalayas; Terai-Dooars ecoregion,2022,56,4,10.1007/s10452-022-09973-7,1386-2588,21,170,199,1561,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Several dozen species of snails migrated, during the last two centuries, in either direction across North Atlantic and this process is ongoing. The intensity of the faunal exchange is unequal since much more snail species have dispersed from North America to Europe than in the opposite direction. Two cases of ``failed{''} invasions of North American lymnaeid snails to Europe are discussed. A species of pulmonate snails, Ampullaceana balthica (Linnaeus, 1758), is reported here as new for the malacofauna of Canada (and for the whole North America).

AQUATIC INVASIONS,"Abundance and growth of the invasive Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea, in the lower Columbia River, USA","The Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea, is a broadly distributed and abundant invasive species, yet many aspects of its biology are not well understood. Based on previous research by other investigators, we hypothesized that abundance, population growth rate, and individual growth rate of C. fluminea would increase with temperature, chlorophyll -a, and dissolved oxygen. We sampled C. fluminea at two sites in the lower Columbia River (CR), USA. Modal progression analyses indicated a life span of 2-3 years. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) predicting the abundance of C. fluminea indicated a significant negative association with chlorophyll -a concentration, whereas a GLMM predicting the population growth rate of C. fluminea indicated a significant positive association with dissolved oxygen. The GLMM predicting the individual growth rate of C. fluminea indicated the individual growth rate was not significantly related to any individual environmental variable. Overall, these results emphasize that the biology of C. fluminea in the CR is similar in many regards to other populations studied in temperate regions globally, but that important spatial differences can occur between sites separated by 60 km within the same river system.",invasive species; population biology; aquatic ecology; North America,2022,17,1,10.3391/ai.2022.17.1.03,1798-6540,16,101,185,1247,4,NA,300,7,Other structure requirements,325,275,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC INVASIONS,Effect of lipid levels and size in invasive carp overwinter survival,"Recruitment is one of the most important dynamic rate functions (i.e., recruitment, growth, and mortality). Often, recruitment can be heavily dependent on overwinter survival. Wintertime presents thermal and metabolic challenges to fish. Studies have suggested that overwinter survival and mortality is correlated to lipid content before entering winter. Inadequate lipid reserves are related to poor condition and may lead to overwinter mortality. Young fish need to accumulate adequate lipid reserves before entering winter. In the Mississippi River, where silver carp Hypophthalmichthys moltrix Valenciennes, 1844 are hyper abundant, silver carp are not experiencing recruitment issues. As such, we evaluated lipid levels and size as potential silver carp recruitment regulators. Silver carp were collected by the Long Term Resource Monitoring element in 2015 on the middle Mississippi River using mini fyke nets; total lengths ranged from 34-177 mm. Lipid levels of whole carp were determined using the phosphovanillin assay. No difference in lipid levels (mg/g) was observed between spring and fall fishes. Additionally, we observed no relation between total length and lipid levels. Size structure did not significantly differ between fall age-0 and spring age-1 silver carp. Our results suggest there may not be a size dependent overwinter mortality/survival in silver carp in the middle Mississippi River. Additionally, lipids may not be a driving factor in overwinter mortality/survival. Our research suggests silver carp in the Mississippi River basin do not follow most early life history paradigms and may explain the successful nature of the silver carp invasion.",recruitment; early life-history; invasive species; Mississippi River; population dynamics,2022,17,2,10.3391/ai.2022.17.2.10,1798-6540,11,68,245,1676,5,NA,300,7,Other structure requirements,325,275,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC INVASIONS,Environmental related variation in growth and life-history traits of non-native sailfin catfishes (Pterygoplichthys spp.) across river basins of South China,"Plasticity in growth and life-history traits is an important attribute of non-native (NN) fishes, facilitating their adaptation to novel environments. Few studies have investigated geographical variations in multiple biological traits and the factors affecting the variations. In this study, variations in multiple biological traits of NN sailfin catfishes Pterygoplichthys spp. were investigated in the main river basins of the Guangdong and Hainan provinces of South China. The impacts of environmental factors on the biological traits were analysed using general linear modeling and an information-theoretic approach. Among-basin differences in population growth was observed, with richness of competitor fishes negatively affecting growth, maturity and reproductive traits - this suggests biotic resistance was mediated by competition with native fishes. These traits were positively affected by total phosphorus concentration, which is indicative of bottom-up effects, mediated by inorganic nutrients, potentially playing an important role in the invasion success of NN fish. In population level, a bet-hedging strategy was observed in sailfin catfishes under unfavourable environment conditions (e.g. Nangdujiang), whereas a ``master-of-some{''} strategy was found under favourable conditions (e.g. Pearl River Delta and Western Basin). The results suggested that plasticity in multiple biological traits of sailfin catfishes is an important strategy to overcome changing environmental conditions in different rivers, and habitat-specific variations across river basins would reflect trade-offs amongst traits at the population level. Therefore, habitat-specific management measures, adapted to the invaded ecosystem's features and the life-history strategy of the NN species, could provide an effective means to control invasive species.",fish invasion; phenotypic plasticity; multiple biological traits; resource availability; loricariid fish,2022,17,1,10.3391/ai.2022.17.1.06,1798-6540,20,156,246,1844,5,NA,300,7,Other structure requirements,325,275,no,yes,yes

This species complex has recently been recorded spreading to natural intertidal and subtidal habitats on the central California outer coast near the San Francisco Bay, suggesting that its invasive potential is greater than previously believed. To determine the species and clades present in these outer coast populations, and their relationship to populations in nearby bays and harbors, we produced COI sequences for a set of new Watersipora specimens sampled from four rocky intertidal sites, for which there is currently no published genetic data. Watersipora subtorquata and Watersipora new species were both identified at rocky intertidal sites. All haplotypes identified in this analysis have previously been reported in California harbors and marinas, suggesting that intertidal populations may be sourced from existing populations in harbors, rather than representing independent invasions. Field observations of intertidal populations support Watersipora's year-round persistence at rocky intertidal sites, which has significant implications for invasion dynamics and invasion management strategies. Continued sequencing of outer coast Watersipora samples will be crucial to further characterize the genetic diversity and structure of these coastal populations and describe the dynamics of Watersipora's outer coast spread.",cryptic species; introduced species; San Francisco Bay; marine invertebrates; cytochrome oxidase I,2022,17,2,10.3391/ai.2022.17.2.01,1798-6540,18,125,210,1514,5,NA,300,7,Other structure requirements,325,275,no,yes,yes

AQUATIC INVASIONS,Invading grass-like alga transforms rippled sand bars into bumpy muddy flats: arrival of a game changer in the Wadden Sea?,"In the wake of biological globalization, translocated species of high bio-engineering capacity increasingly change bottom topography of sedimentary coasts. A Vaucheria- taxon (Xanthophyceae) of unknown origin is spreading at the transition between intertidal and subtidal zones, while resident Vaucheria-species are confined to the upper shore in the Wadden Sea (European Atlantic). Near the island of Sylt, dense turfs of green filaments rapidly expanded over an area of 180 ha within 3 years. The unicellular filaments reach about 5 cm out of and 5 cm into the sediment. Felted rhizoids provide firm anchorage. Dry phytomass (up to 208 g m-2) was similar to that of intertidal seagrass beds. Residual filaments overwinter in the sediment and give rise to renewed growth in late spring. In addition, oospores germinate. Fine particles are trapped by the turf during summer, generating laminated cohesive mud. Muddy hummocks arise up to 20 cm above ambient sand flats, alternating with troughs but gradually merge into coherent and pertinacious plateaus of mud. This shift in bottom topography and sediment composition may potentially change the mud balance of tidal basins, and the capacity of tidal flats in catching up with accelerating sea-level rise.",invasion; algal turf; bioengineering; mud; tidal flats; Vaucheria,2022,17,1,10.3391/ai.2022.17.1.01,1798-6540,20,122,193,1255,6,NA,300,7,Other structure requirements,325,275,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC INVASIONS,"More non-native fish species than natives, and an invasion of Malawi cichlids, in ancient Lake Poso, Sulawesi, Indonesia","Ancient Lake Poso in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, is among the deepest lakes in Asia, and hosts a largely endemic fauna of fishes, crustaceans, and molluscs. Introduction of non-native fish species started at least a century ago to foster local fish production. Recent fieldwork suggests that introduction of non-native fishes is ongoing, including species that originate from the ornamental pet trade. These include the hybridogenic ornamental ``flowerhorn{''} cichlid, a fish that spread rapidly in Sulawesi's Malili Lakes, and the ``golden cichlid,{'' Melanochromis auratus from African Lake Malawi. This popular aquarium species colonized Lake Poso even more rapidly than the flowerhorn, and is omnipresent at benthic habitats across most of the lake. Here, we list records of 17 non-native fish species from Lake Poso, present the first assessment of golden cichlid stomach contents outside of their native habitat, report the occurrences of non-native crustaceans, molluscs and plants, and discuss potential impacts on the native fauna and ecosystem. Most of the non-native species have established substantial populations, and it appears very plausible that the non-native fauna affects endemics. This is supported by the finding that golden cichlid stomachs contained a broad spectrum of items, including fish, their scales, fins, eggs and larvae, and various invertebrates. We conclude that non-native species introduction poses a substantial and increasing threat to the Lake Poso fauna, a major hotspot of aquatic biodiversity in the Wallacea region.",species flock; conservation; ancient lakes; non-native fishes; freshwater,2022,17,1,10.3391/ai.2022.17.1.05,1798-6540,18,120,229,1561,5,NA,300,7,Other structure requirements,325,275,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC INVASIONS,Palatability of mangrove leaves to invasive apple snails: the relation between feeding electivity and multiple plant characteristics,"Mangrove forests worldwide have been subjected to biological invasion. Invasive apple snails (Pomacea canaliculata) have established populations in some mangrove forests. The feeding behavior of P. canaliculata in mangroves has been unclear until now. The feeding electivity of P. canaliculata to mangrove leaves, including leaves from Acanthus ilicifolius, Acrostichum aureum, Kandelia candel, Aegiceras corniculatum, and Sonneratia apetala, was studied through a selective test, a nonselective test, and a T-tube test. The growth indicators, the feeding ratio, the feeding rate, the feeding amount, the electivity indicator, and the electivity frequency were determined. The weight increase ratios of P. canaliculata that consumed leaves of A. ilicifolius and A. aureum were higher than those that consumed leaves of K. candel, S. apetala, and A. corniculatum. The electivity indicator showed that P. canaliculata preferred A. ilicifolius leaves and fed little on A. corniculatum leaves. Acrostichum aureum leaves were the second most preferred food for the apple snails. The feeding electivity of P. canaliculata to leaves from five species of mangrove trees was significantly differentiated by cluster analysis, redundancy analysis, and principal component analysis. Eight feeding indicators of the apple snails were positively correlated with the leaf characteristics of nitrogen content, protein content, leaf area, moisture content, and aspect ratio and negatively correlated with the lignin, phenolic, and tannin contents. Pomacea canaliculata could discriminate mangrove leaves through physical and chemical characteristics and shift feeding electivity among mangrove leaves under intraspecific competition. Mangrove forests composed mainly of A. ilicifolius and A. aureum might be at risk of invasion by P. canaliculata.

AQUATIC INVASIONS,"Potential overwintering areas of the alien apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata, in Japan at its northern distribution limit","For risk assessment and prevention of further invasion of the alien apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata, into new habitats in Japan, we estimated the snail's potential overwintering areas on the basis of climate data and a field census. Presence or absence was examined at 38 sites in six regions of Kyushu Island, where the snail has invaded most areas in which it can overwinter. The effects of cumulative low temperature during winter on the presence/absence data were examined by using a logistic regression analysis. As a result, a model using cumulative low temperature below 10 degrees C (CLT10) was adopted as the best determinant of snail overwintering success, with the risk evaluation formula y = 1 / {[}1 + exp(-4.7931474 + 0.007574x)], where x is CLT10 (5-year average) and y is the probability of overwintering success. To verify the model, y was calculated for 1348 sites on Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu islands where P. canaliculata was confirmed to be present by recent field censuses. Of these sites, 1344 (> 99.7\%) had y values exceeding 0.4; the remaining four had y values ranging from > 0.2 to 0.4, with a minimum of 0.377. These results indicate that the model can be used to predict the overwintering success and subsequent localization of P. canaliculata.

AQUATIC INVASIONS,Presence of a second Eriocheir species in Europe as confirmed by molecular and morphological data,"New Chinese mitten crab sequence data were obtained from eight European localities spanning France, The Netherlands, England and Wales. The Netherlands and Wales samples were taken from two areas where mitten crab populations had never before been sequenced. DNA results uncovered the presence of a second Eriocheir species coexisting sympatrically with E. sinensis H. Milne Edwards, 1853 in the Dee Estuary, Wales and at two sites sampled in The Netherlands. Molecular results and comparative morphology analyses suggest that the second species in European waters is likely to be an undescribed cryptic species. Additional evidence for the presence of a second European invasive mitten crab species is provided by confocal laser scanning microscopy of the male first gonopod. The origins of the Welsh introduction may date back to the early 2000s, when several Dutch dredging operators were active in the Dee Estuary. Despite several localities being sampled, the Eriocheir cryptic species was not found in England, which suggests that English and Welsh mitten crab populations originate from independent introductions. These results radically challenge current assessments of Eriocheir invasion in Europe and should be considered by stakeholders as a new baseline to implement efficient management strategies against invasive mitten crabs.",Chinese mitten crab; cryptic species; Dee Estuary Wales; dredging operations; phylogeography; molecular systematics; morphometrics; confocal laser scanning microscopy; first male gonopod morphology; carapace frontal margin,2022,17,3,10.3391/ai.2022.17.3.03,1798-6540,15,97,198,1341,10,NA,300,7,Other structure requirements,325,275,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC INVASIONS,Spread of invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies and their effect on native fish species in the Neckar River (South Germany),"Fish assemblages in the Neckar River were investigated by electrofishing under the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD) to assess the ecological status of rivers. This monitoring program also provides information on the distribution of invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies along the Neckar River in Germany, a tributary of the Rhine River. The western tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris was first recorded on the Neckar River in 2007, followed by bighead goby Ponticola kessleri and round goby Neogobius melanostomus in 2009 and 2012, respectively. The current distribution boundary for Ponto-Caspian gobies coincides with the navigation limit for cargo ships at the river port of Plochingen (about 200 km up-stream of the city of Mannheim). Marked differences in fish assemblages took place following invasion of the round goby, with average CPUE of native stone loach Barbatula barbatula and gudgeon Gobio gobio declining from 19.6 and 21.5 individuals per 100 m, respectively, to fewer than one. Bighead gobies failed to build up a stable stock after round goby invasion but have still been caught in small numbers at most sampling sections. The earlier-arriving western tubenose goby could not be detected any longer. The results indicate a strong impact of the round goby on native fish assemblages in the Neckar River which will hamper efforts to improve the ecological quality of the river. Further investigations are needed to assess long term effects of round goby invasion and find solutions for achieving the mandatory European Water Framework Directive (WFD) target of ``good ecological status `` of the river.",biodiversity; gudgeon; invasive alien species; round goby; stone loach,2022,17,2,10.3391/ai.2022.17.2.05,1798-6540,18,115,250,1626,5,NA,300,7,Other structure requirements,325,275,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC INVASIONS,The distribution and spread of quagga mussels in perialpine lakes north of the Alps,"The dreissenids, quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis and zebra mussel D. polymorpha, are invasive freshwater mussels in Europe and North America. These species strongly impact aquatic ecosystems, such as the food web through their high abundance and filtration rate. They spread quickly within and between waterbodies, and have the ability to colonize various substrates and depths. The zebra mussel invaded and established in Swiss lakes in the 1960s, whereas the quagga mussel was not detected until 2014. We collected all available data from cantonal as well as local authorities and other institutions to describe the colonization pattern of quagga mussels in perialpine lakes north of the Alps. We also collected data regarding the distribution of larval stages of the mussels, the so-called veliger larvae. We observed that in lakes colonized by the quagga mussel, veligers are present the whole year round, whereas they are absent in winter in lakes with only zebra mussels. Additionally, we present detailed information about the invasion and colonization pattern of quagga mussels in Lake Constance. Quagga mussels colonized the lakeshore within a few years (similar to 2016-2018), outcompeted zebra mussels, and have reached densities > 5000 ind.m(-2) in the littoral zone, even at 80 m densities above 1000 ind.m(-2) were found at some locations. At the end of the article, we discussed possibilities on how the spread of quagga mussels within and among northern perialpine lakes should be monitored and prevented in the future.",Dreissena density; Dreissena bugensis; veliger phenology; monitoring; Lake Constance; invasive species,2022,17,2,10.3391/ai.2022.17.2.02,1798-6540,14,83,238,1536,6,NA,300,7,Other structure requirements,325,275,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC INVASIONS,Trematode parasites have minimal effect on the behavior of invasive green crabs,"Trophically-transmitted endoparasites can manipulate the behavior of intermediate hosts to increase transmission to definitive hosts. Less clear, however, is whether these relationships exist when parasites and hosts have limited coevolutionary history, e.g., a native parasite infecting an invasive host. We investigated infection by the northeastern North American trematode Microphallus similis in non-native green crabs (Carcinus maenas) to assess whether infection by M. similis influenced feeding behaviors in C. maenas and if this changed with time post-infection. We manipulated infection by randomly assigning crabs to parasite exposure and control groups. We then measured individual crab behavior at five time points (pre-infection, 72 h, 1 week, 2 week, and 3 week post-infection) with an established ethogram that recorded multiple behavioral types. We also conducted righting response trials at each time point and additionally at 4 and 5 weeks post-exposure. Compared to controls, infected crabs showed little difference in recorded behaviors, and burden of infection (i.e., number of trematode cysts) was not correlated to any behavioral metric. This lack of behavioral impact occurred at all stages of infection. Active parasite penetration/establishment early in the infection process did not provoke greater behavioral response than later stages, when the encysted parasite becomes relatively dormant. Although M. similis is capable of infecting non-native C. maenas, our results suggest that it does not manipulate host behavior, possibly because of limited coevolutionary history with C. maenas in the region, or because host manipulation is unnecessary for successful completion of its life cycle. In nature, this may have implications for the crab's invasion success in the western Atlantic, where it has escaped much of its native parasite diversity.",Carcinus maneas; coevolutionary history; enemy release; manipulation; microphallid; Microphallus similis; non-native,2022,17,2,10.3391/ai.2022.17.2.07,1798-6540,12,79,269,1874,7,NA,300,7,Other structure requirements,325,275,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"16S rRNA gene sequences of Candidatus Methylumidiphilus (Methylococcales), a putative methanotrophic genus in lakes and ponds","A putative novel methanotrophic genus, Candidatus Methylumidiphilus (Methylococcales), was recently shown to be ubiquitous and one of the most abundant methanotrophic genera in water columns of oxygen-stratified lakes and ponds in boreal and subarctic areas. However, it has probably escaped detection in many previous studies that used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing due to insufficient database coverage, as previously analysed metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) affiliated with Ca. Methylumidiphilus do not contain 16S rRNA genes. Therefore, we screened MAGs affiliated with the genus for their 16S rRNA gene sequences in a recently published lake and pond MAG data set. Among 66 MAGs classified as Ca. Methylumidiphilus (with completeness over 40\% and contamination less than 5 \%) originating from lakes in Finland, Sweden and Switzerland as well as from ponds in Canada, we found 5 MAGs, each containing one 1532 bp sequence spanning the V1-V9 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. After removal of sequence redundancy, this resulted in 2 unique 16S rRNA gene sequences. These sequences represented 2 different putative species: Ca. Methylumidiphilus alinenensis (GenBank accession OK236221) and another unnamed species of Ca. Methylumidiphilus (GenBank accession OK236220).

AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Diversity of taxon-specific traits of seasonally distinct unicellular eukaryotic assemblages in a eutrophic coastal area with marked plankton blooms,"In this work, we focused on the functional characterization of unicellular eukaryotic assemblages that had previously been taxonomically characterized by 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in a eutrophic coastal site with marked plankton blooms. Biological traits of different functional groups were assigned to the retrieved operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The traits included size, trophic strategy, the presence of spines, mucilage production, colony formation, motility, spore formation, and potential harmfulness. Functional diversity indices were calculated and compared to analogous taxonomic diversity indices, indicating a strong positive coupling of richness and dominance and a negative coupling of evenness, even at a low taxonomic resolution (at the family/genus/species level). Biological trait trade-offs and co-occurrences of specific traits were evident during the succession of plankton blooms. The trophic strategy dominating in the assemblages frequently alternated between autotrophy, mixotrophy, and a few recorded cases of parasitism. Given that there was no indication of nutrient limitation, we suggest that biotic pressures force marine eukaryotes to exploit narrow niches by adopting specific strategies/traits that favour their survival. These traits act by increasing resource acquisition potential and via predator avoidance. This leads to a unique succession of blooms in the system, characterized by adaptations of the bloom taxa that are a direct response to the preceding assemblage.",High throughput sequencing; Marine protists; 18S rRNA gene; Functional diversity; Biological traits,2022,88,NA,10.3354/ame01992,0948-3055,19,148,209,1520,5,20,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Evaluation of the mycobiome of ballast water and implications for fungal pathogen distribution,"Marine transport has the potential to alter the geographic range of microorganisms through ballast water movement. Recent culture-independent studies investigated the bacteriome of ballast water, but no prior studies have examined the mycobiome. Here were examined 60 ballast and harbor samples from 4 major ports and 5 ocean samples using culture-independent techniques to determine (1) the composition of harbor and ballast water mycobiomes; (2) if ballast contained human and environmentally relevant fungal pathogens; and (3) the potential risk of introduction to coastal ecosystems. Results indicate that ballast water and harbor water contain a diverse mycobiome and that ballast water may contain fungal taxa that are relevant human and marine fish pathogens. Fungal genera were identified that contain known coral and coastal plant pathogen species; however, species-level identification of these potential pathogens could not be conclusively resolved. Ballast and harbor mycobiomes contained similar taxa, suggesting that environmental filtering may not inhibit the spread of fungal taxa between these ecosystems. This study highlights the potential risks of ballast movement and suggests further research of the ballast mycobiome is needed.",Community ecology; Fungi; Marine environment; Global transport; Species introduction,2022,88,NA,10.3354/ame01990,0948-3055,13,94,177,1250,5,20,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Feeding ecology and microbiome of the pteropod Limacina helicina antarctica,"The pteropod (pelagic snail) Limacina helicina antarctica is a dominant grazer along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and plays an important role in regional food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycling. For the first time, we examined the gut microbiome and feeding ecology of L. h. antarctica based on 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences of gut contents in the WAP during austral summer. Eukaryotic gut contents of L. h. antarctica indicate that this species predominantly feeds on diatoms and dinoflagellates, supplementing its diet with ciliates and foraminifera.

AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Microalgal characterization during a mucilaginous bloom on deep gorgonian forests of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo MPA,"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have increased in frequency, but despite an extreme increase in research on this topic, general knowledge on HABs is still scarce. Mucilaginous algal blooms, in particular, are ever more present and can heavily affect marine ecosystems. Gorgonians appear significantly affected, as their branches are easily entangled (pelagic aggregates) and overgrown (benthic aggregates) by mucilage. Moreover, their proximity to the bottom makes them susceptible to benthic anoxia. In the present study, we investigated the mucilaginous bloom that affected the gorgonian forests of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (MPA) (NE coast of Sardinia) in summer 2020. We focused mainly on the characterization of dominant benthic microalgae, identifying those responsible for the bloom. Sampling was performed considering the colonies of Paramuricea clavata present on hard substrata along 2 transects near the Secca del Papa, in the B Zone of the MPA. The characterization of the microalgal community and the count of the most abundant species (>10 cells ml-1) were carried out using the Utermohl sedimentation method. The community was mainly composed of diatoms (Bacillariophyta) belonging to the genera Pseudo-nitzschia, Nitzschia and Cylindrotheca. C. closterium appeared to be the most abundant species.

AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"Microbial communities (bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes) in a temperate estuary during seasonal hypoxia","Eutrophication and hypoxia markedly alter trophic dynamics and nutrient cycling in estuarine water columns, but little is known about the microbial communities that drive and interact with these changes. Here we studied microbial plankton (bacteria, archaea, protists and micro-metazoans) in a large temperate estuary where bottom hypoxia occurs every summer due to warmer temperatures, stratification, and oxidation of organic matter fueled by nutrient enrichment. We used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes (V4 region) and quantified multiple abiotic and biotic factors in surface and bottom waters during the summer of 2019. The conditions associated with the intensification of hypoxia in bottom waters as the summer progressed were linked to significant changes in the diversity, community structure and potential functioning of microbial communities. Under maximum hypoxia (dissolved oxygen concentration: 0.9-3.1 mg 1(-1)), there were increased proportions of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacterivorous and parasitic protists, and copepod nauplii. Sequence proportions of AOA (Nitrosopumilus) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospinaceae) were significantly correlated with the concentration of oxidized N species (nitrite plus nitrate, which peaked at 14.4 mu M) and the proportions of nauplii DNA sequences and biomass.

AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,A phosphate starvation response gene (psr1-like) is present and expressed in Micromonas pusilla and other marine algae,"Phosphorus (P) limits primary production in regions of the surface ocean, and many plankton species exhibit specific physiological responses to P deficiency. The metabolic response of Micromonas pusilla, an ecologically relevant marine photoautotroph, to P deficiency was investigated using metabolomics and comparative genomics. The concentrations of some intracellular metabolites were elevated in the P-deficient cells (e.g. xanthine, inosine), and genes involved in the associated metabolic pathways shared a predicted conserved amino acid motif in the non-coding regions of each gene. The presence of the conserved motif suggests that these genes may be co-regulated, and the motif may constitute a regulatory element for binding a transcription factor, specifically that of Psr1 (phosphate starvation response). A putative phosphate starvation response gene (psr1-like) was identified in M. pusilla with homology to well characterized psr1/phr1 genes in algae and plants, respectively. This gene appears to be present and expressed in other marine algal taxa (e.g. EmiBanta huxleyi) in field sites that are chronically P limited.

The richness of operational taxonomic units increased downstream of the pre-treatment system (reverse osmosis feedwater) compared to raw seawater for Archaea, while it decreased for bacteria and protists. Overall, the reverse osmosis feedwater was found to be enriched in ammonia-oxidising bacteria and Archaea compared to raw seawater, and also contained greater proportions of taxa typically observed in aquatic biofilms and/or within other water treatment systems. Although the microbial load was reduced by the pre-treatment system, the increase in proportion of biofilm-associated microbes suggests the presence of active microbial communities within multimedia filters and other parts of the pre-treatment system that might increase biofouling risks.",16S rDNA; 18S rDNA; Ammonium oxidation; Desalination,2021,86,NA,10.3354/ame01958,0948-3055,11,90,130,955,4,20,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Effects of seawater viscosity and temperature on the movement of the marine dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum,"It is important to understand how planktonic dinoflagellate movements may be affected by environmental conditions, including those potentially influenced by climate change. Because of their small size, dinoflagellates can be expected to be highly sensitive to changes in viscosity; however, there is currently little understanding of how these organisms and other algae may be regulated by seawater viscosity. Previous work that has addressed the effects of seawater viscosity on single-celled plankton considered unnaturally large viscosity changes from a bio-mechanical perspective, sometimes without considering temperature effects. We studied the swimming of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum, a common coastal species, when exposed to environmentally relevant temperature and viscosity changes. P. minimum showed an additive response to seawater viscosity and temperature: cold temperature and high viscosity both slowed swimming speeds. However, seawater temperature and viscosity did not affect the movement direction or linearity of swimming of the dinoflagellates. We argue that temperature-related changes in movement may be partially regulated by a mechanical response to viscosity, which increases at cold temperature. We also propose possible future directions for laboratory and modelling studies.",Dinoflagellate; Plankton; Seawater viscosity; Temperature; Motility,2021,86,NA,10.3354/ame01957,0948-3055,15,111,178,1317,5,20,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

However, microbial composition and therefore their role in ecosystems is likely to be strongly influenced by the environment. Here, we examined Macquarie Harbour, a highly stratified system on the west coast of Tasmania, Australia, to determine environmental factors driving microbial diversity. Water was sampled along spatial and environmental gradients to examine the structure and composition of the microbial communities, using high-throughput sequencing. The spatial distribution of the communities was found to be homogenous throughout the harbour's surface, although it differed from riverine and oceanic samples. In contrast, the distribution and composition of microbial communities varied with depth-related changes in salinity and oxygen. Prokaryotes associated with riverine and brackish waters dominated the oxic surface waters. Phytoplankton metabolite-related bacteria and nitrite oxidizers were abundant at the halocline, whereas microbes linked to the consumption of organic matter, nitrogen and sulphur metabolization inhabited the hypoxic bottom waters and may be acting as major players in oxygen consumption throughout the harbour's water column.

However, researchers do not yet know the extent of fungal diversity and species distribution within these important ecosystems. Therefore, we examined the detrital fungal communities from contrasting aquatic habitats (temperate peatlands and streams) to provide an in-depth inventory and greater understanding of how these communities differ. Fine submerged detritus or substrate on or beneath the stream bed were collected from 6 sites. Fungal cultures were isolated from samples collected in May, July/August, and November from 2 sites in 2014 and 4 sites in 2016. Culture-independent analyses were conducted on 42 environmental samples collected in November 2016. Results indicated that peatland and stream fungal communities were taxonomically diverse, phylogenetically distinct, and harbored many unknown taxa from the kingdom Fungi. Specifically, stream habitats were more species-rich, in both number of species and phylogenetic diversity, compared to peatland habitats. In addition, fungal species and phylogenetic distribution within most major fungal classes were distinct between peatland and stream fungal communities.

ARCTIC SCIENCE,"Algal responses to metal(loid) pollution, urbanization, and climatic changes in subarctic lakes around Yellowknife, Canada","The lakes around Yellowknife (Northwest Territories, Canada) have been impacted by multiple environmental stressors throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries. Here, we have synthesized diatom assemblage data from ten lake sediment cores from the Yellowknife area and used a landscape-scale paleolimnological approach to investigate the cumulative impacts of past gold mining activities, urbanization, and climate warming on aquatic biota. Our investigations indicated that diatom species turnover (measured using detrended canonical correspondence analysis) was highest at lakes closer to the city and mines, as these sites were more severely impacted by land-use changes (e.g., sewage disposal, run-off from waste disposal sites) and roaster stack emission from the gold mines. Diatom assemblage shifts indicative of climate-induced changes to lake thermal properties were also observed across the gradient of human activities. The inclusion of remote sites was useful to disentangle the effects of climate-mediated changes from impacts related to mining and urbanization. This investigation suggests that the diatom assemblages of the lakes around Yellowknife have changed markedly over the last similar to 80 years and there are no signs of biological recovery since the cessation of mining activities around the turn of the 21st century.

ARCTIC SCIENCE,Isotopic and traits-based trophic diversity of Canadian Beaufort Sea benthic communities in relation to food supply,"In the Arctic, climate-driven alterations to the quality and quantity of organic matter reaching the seafloor will likely affect benthic food web function. We used biomass-weighted diversity measures based on trophic traits (those related to feeding behaviours, e.g., mobility, size, food source), stable isotope ratios (delta N-15 and delta C-13), and taxonomy to assess linkages between benthic food web structure and indicators of food supply in the shelf and slope ecosystems of the Canadian Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf (down to 500 m). Benthic communities across both regions used a similar diversity of sedimentary organic matter sources according to stable isotopes, despite known differences between regions in organic matter input and benthicpelagic coupling. Shelf-edge and upper-slope communities exhibited relatively high trophic trait diversity, which likely reflected the exploitation of pulsed food inputs associated with dynamic processes at the shelf break that affect the production and advection of organic matter to the benthos. Pairwise relationships between trophic traits and sedimentary proxies of benthic food supply were not significant at the regional scale. However, cluster analyses supported the notion that trophic trait composition was influenced by proximity to the shelf edge, where food supply is influenced by episodic events that may not be reflected by in situ sedimentary proxies. Our findings add to growing evidence that evaluating trophic traits composition may provide more information regarding functional responses to changes in benthic food supply than either isotopic or taxonomic diversity indices alone.",trait-environment relationships; Beaufort Sea; Amundsen Gulf; RLQ; organic matter pathways,2022,NA,NA,10.1139/AS-2021-0040,NA,16,115,239,1655,5,NA,200,NA,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
ARID ECOSYSTEMS,Invasion of the Ash-Leaved Maple (Acer negundo L.) in the Buzulukskiy Bor National Park,"Theinvasion of Acer negundo L. into floodplain forests with the dominance of Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. has been studied in the Buzulukskiy Bor National Park located in the Orenburg region. In this region, this invasive species is observed in various forest stands. According to the current data, it occupies over 20 000 hectares or -5\% of the total forest area and is actively naturalizing in natural floodplain forests. A. negundo is included into the ``black list{''} of Orenburg and neighboring regions and in the ``black hundred{''} of invasive species of Russia. This work was arranged on two bands of sample plots located on the right and left banks of the Borovka River that flows through the protected area (65 plots in total, each 20 x 50 m in size). The woody phytocenoses of the Borovka River floodplains are formed mainly byAlnus glutinosa, Salix alba L., Acer negundo, and Populus nigra L. For the entire studied area, the dominant species is A. glutinosa (100\% occurrence), whose average number reaches 545 per ha (80.4\% of the total number of trees) and significantly exceeds the total number of trees of other species. The average number ofA. negundo trees is 34 per ha (66.2\% occurrence); this invasive species takes the third place among tree species after S. alba (46 per ha, 63.1\% occurrence). Another 11 tree species have been classified as species of low importance for the floodplain communities of the Borovka River. According to the obtained data, the dense and mature riparian forest formed mainly by A. glutinosa with the admixture of S. alba and P nigra is able to maintain the balance of its species diversity, and both the invasion and the degree of dominance of A. negundo do not exceed the value of a secondary species with a 5\% share in phytocoenoses on average (for some sample plots, the maximum share of this species reaches 17-20\%).

ARID ECOSYSTEMS,The Hydrochemistry and Hydrobiology of Technogenic Reservoirs at Mining Territories of the Southeastern Transbaikal Region,"Reservoirs of anthropogenic genesis are a special component of the technogenic landscape. Their environmental conditions differ from those of natural water bodies. Such differences include a limited catchment area and a low thickness of bottom sediments, as well as high contents of metals, metalloids, and salts. The objects of our research are various lake formations that formed during the development of mineral deposits in the Eastern Transbaikal region. This article describes the chemical composition of the waters and the species diversity and the structure of hydrobiont communities that are different in their formation and purpose of technogenic reservoirs of mining areas. Algae and zooplankton of technogenic water bodies in a region with an arid climate have been studied for the first time. The studied waters have a variety of morphometric and physicochemical characteristics with a wide range of pH values (2.99-8.80), total mineralization (85.9-9065 mg/L), and content of ore and associated elements. According to the chemical composition, the waters are sulphate and bicarbonate-sulphate, with different ratios of magnesium and calcium. The species diversity of the algae and zooplankton of the studied water bodies is low (75 taxa of plankton algae, 8 taxa of macroalgae, and 63 species and subspecies of plankton invertebrates). This is associated with extreme environmental conditions, where species richness is influenced by physicochemical conditions of the habitat. The determining factors for the development of Cryptophyta representatives are micro- and macrocomponent composition and general mineralization, for other groups of phytoplankton (Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta, Chrysophyta, Charophyta, Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta, and Dynophyta) it was the content of bicarbonates. Quantitative indicators of zooplankton are positively related to the concentration of ammonium nitrogen (for Crustacea) and negatively to pH (Rotifera).",mining fields; technogenic reservoirs; hydrochemical composition; phytoplankton; macroalgae; zooplankton,2022,12,4,10.1134/S2079096122040023,2079-0961,15,122,276,1958,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ARID ECOSYSTEMS,Identification of Ancient Anthropogenic Activities in Steppe Regions on the Basis of Holocene Deposits in the Southeastern Part of Rostov Oblast,"The gully system of the Sal and Don Rivers in the southeastern part of Rostov oblast was surveyed; the collected data indicate that Holocene deposits occupy a significant area and show high diversity. Accumulation of Holocene deposits in different areas was determined by local specifics, exogenous processes, landforms, parent rocks, and other factors. The following types of Holocene deposits were identified: (1) deposits on negative landforms (floodplain and first terrace above the floodplain) formed by alluvial, deluvial, and, to a certain extent, eolian processes; (2) deposits on the second terrace above the floodplain formed at the end of the Khvalynian stage of the Caspian Sea and during the new euxinic stage of the Black Sea; and (3) intermediate forms of Holocene deposits in minor depressions. The deposit accumulation history on negative and positive landforms is determined by the presence of contrasting stages reflecting changes in the external environment. The identified Holocene deposits of different ages turned out to be confined to archaeological artifacts indicating short-term habitats of nomadic cattle herders in various epochs. This makes it possible to identify and subsequently research ``invisible{''} early human sites and obtain additional data on anthropogenic impacts on steppe resource areas in ancient times.",paleogeography; Holocene; gully; soil; steppe; Don River; archaeological artifact,2022,12,3,10.1134/S2079096122030040,2079-0961,21,144,200,1349,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ARID ECOSYSTEMS,The Properties of Agriculture-Related Objects in Arid Regions in Northwest Mongolia and the Tyva Border Areas,"Long-term studies allowed the author to assign the arid areas of traditional livestock farming in Central Asia to regions of agriculture extensively developed in the past. It is well known that in Central Mongolia there are multiple traces of sedentary agricultural people, for instance, the settlement cities of the Early Medieval Period. The Uvs Nuur Basin area covered by bare shifting sands and the valley of its main stream known as the Tes-Khem River, located in Northwest Mongolia, were not previously regarded as regions recognized for ancient agriculture. Nevertheless, the author's surveys found the traces of an authentic ancient civilization based on agriculture within the indicated area. A wide range of irrigation systems, traces of ancient settlements and cities, and the specific character of ancient agricultural landscapes would clearly suggest conducting a comprehensive study of the ancient history and the anthropogenic impact on the environments in this region. Certain agriculture-related objects, whose properties are of great interest for understanding the history of human civilization in the Uvs Nuur basin, the Tes-Khem River valley, and Central Asia, are considered in this article. The study is based on the decryption of satellite images (Google.Earth, Infokart, and Syssoft), landscape observations, the geological, geographical, archeological, and historical methods, toponymy, and complex soil surveys. Palegeographic features are shown based on the analyses of carpological remains. The objects of the complex system research are the agricultural settlements and the irrigation systems across the upper Tes-Khem River valley (Mongolia) confined to young tectonic-surface rupture zones and Cenozoic basaltoid evolution areas at the absolute elevation of approximately 1700 m and the settlement in its lower-course landscape, consisting of clay-wall structures unaffected by later aonthropogenic impacts (Mongolia). The survey of land sites in the Lake Shara-Nuur area (the Uvs Nuur Basin, Tyva) confined to the lowland peatlands and the peat soils is quite informative. Wheat caryopses in similar peat soils on the territory of neighboring Mongolia were previously found within a survey. A strong anthropogenic impact on the environment (deforestation and uses of agricultural and irrigated landscapes as pastures were followed by overgrazing) caused soil degradation, a groundwater level decline, landscape desertification, and terminal agricultural decline. The complex system of research into the ancient agriculture developed by the author lays the foundations for landscape archaeology of arid regions in Central Asia.",Northwest Mongolia; Uvs Nuur Basin; ancient agriculture related objects; traces of settlements; land sites; irrigation canals; Tsetserleg; Lake Shara-Nuur; Tes-Khem River; Cenozoic volcanism,2022,12,4,10.1134/S2079096122040175,2079-0961,16,109,382,2658,10,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ARID ECOSYSTEMS,Planktonic and Benthic Algocoenoses in Highly Mineralized Rivers that Drain into Lake Elton,"This paper presents results of long-term (2008 and 2012-2019) studies of phytoplankton and phytobenthos in seven highly mineralized rivers of the Lake Elton basin. Two-hundred-and-fourteen algal taxa belonging to seven systematic divisions have been identified in the algal flora; of them, the division Bacillariophyta features the greatest species richness and abundance. A comparative analysis of the taxonomic structure and species diversity of algocoenoses in the mineralization gradient was performed. The following structure-forming species represented by widespread euryhaline taxa were identified: Chaetoceros muelleri Lemm., Conticribra weissflogii (Grun.) S. Suchoples et Williams, Nitzschia closterium Ehr., Halamphora coffeaeformis (Ag.) Meresch., and Achnanthesbrevipes Ag., (Bacillariophyta), as well as Cyanoprokaryota (Phormidium breve (Kutz. ex Gom.) Anagn. \& Kom., Oscillatoria limosa Ag. ex Gom., O. tenuis Ag. ex Gom., and Geitlerinema amphibium (Ag. ex Gom.) Anagn.). Species of the genus Dunaliella (Chlorophyta) predominate in rivers featuring critical salinity conditions. It is established that the abundance and biomass of algae in algocoenoses vary in a wide range and do not depend on the mineralization level. In mesohaline rivers, the negative correlation between specific species richness and mineralization is weak; while in polyhaline rivers, it is statistically significant (R = -0.50, R = -0.52, p < 0.05). Seasonal dynamics of planktonic algocoenoses is manifested by changes in the species structure, abundance, and biomass.",saline rivers; Lake Elton; algocoenoses,2022,12,4,10.1134/S2079096122040059,2079-0961,13,91,215,1562,3,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ARID ECOSYSTEMS,Mapping the Rangelands of Wild Ungulates in the Barsakelmes Nature Reserve (Kazakhstan),"This article presents a medium-scale map of the forage areas of the Kaskakulan cluster area of the Barsakelmes Nature Reserve, where wild ungulates, kulans, saigas, and goitered gazelles, live. The map was designed using data from ground surveys and remote sensing. The author's technique and a set of spectral indices were used for processing satellite data. Maps of seasonal rangeland yields, which were considered when calculating the total yield, were designed based on the interpretation of space images. The legend to the Rangeland map is a system of headings that take into account zonality, ecological and physiognomic types of vegetation, and soil conditions. Types of rangelands are reflected in the legend by 15 numbers; for each the total yield for the seasons of the year is given.

ARID ECOSYSTEMS,The Effects of River Control and Climatic and Hydrological Changes on the State of Floodplain and Delta Ecosystems of the Lower Don,"The terrestrial floodplain ecosystems of the Lower Don are still poorly studied, although almost the entire lower reaches of the Don are regulated by reservoirs and low-head hydroelectric systems, which significantly change ecosystems and landscapes. The research was carried out according to our own methodology. Field studies were carried out on five model ecological profiles with a detailed analysis of vegetation and the position of surface groundwater at model points. Desk studies included analysis of statistical hydrological materials and satellite images from Landsat 2, 3, and 5 and Sentinel-2, as well as the determination of the state of the ecosystems and landscapes using a two-stage methodology for assessing disturbances in terrestrial ecosystems and landscapes as a result of changes in the water level in the study area. It has been revealed that the main factor influencing the change in the biotic components of ecosystems in the Lower Don reaches is the reduction in the amplitude of fluctuations in water discharges (and levels) in the annual cycle as a result of the river control and climate changes. The decrease in the frequency of flooding of the floodplain and delta areas by almost 4 times along with a 3.5 times decrease in spring flood discharges and a 2.2 to 2.3 times increase in low-water discharges (both winter and summer-autumn flows) has led not only to a rise of the Don channel level by more than 2.5 m, but also to a rise and stabilization of the groundwater level (GWL) in the floodplain and delta of the Lower Don, which has involved a succession of communities of the upper and middle floodplains by nontypical invasive species. On the upper floodplain, native oak and elm forests have been almost completely replaced by green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and boxelder maple (Acer negundo) forests. Typical willow (Salix alba) forests on the middle floodplain are replaced by indigobush (Amorpha fruticosa) forests in the near-channel floodplain and oleaster (Elaeagnus angustifolia) forests in the central parts of the floodplain. The forb meadows of the middle floodplain are replaced by almost monodominant reed-grass (Calamagrostis epigeios) meadows with thorny weeds of thistle (Cirsium) and cocklebur (Xanthium) species. Newly formed nontypical floodplain communities are better resistant to a year-round steadily high GWL. Assessment of the disturbance of the water level in the ecosystems and landscapes on a 5-point scale according to our own methodology has shown that the least disturbed (two of the five possible points) areas are the areas that are most distant from the hydraulic structures, namely, areas in the new and old Don deltas. The other profiles (3-5), located in the impact zone of the hydraulic structures, have a moderate degree of disturbance (three points), which currently requires only local hydraulic and forest engineering drainage measures, rather than changes in the hydrological regime of the river.",Lower Don; water flow change; low-water period; high water; waterlogging; floodplain; groundwater level (GWL); floodplain ecosystems and landscapes; assessment of ecosystem disturbance,2022,12,4,10.1134/S2079096122040126,2079-0961,22,131,467,2980,9,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ARID ECOSYSTEMS,Environmental and Economic Assessment of Agricultural Land Degradation in the Central and Western Zones of the Republic of Tyva,"The presented ecological and economic assessment of agricultural land in the Republic of Tyva was developed taking into account the theoretical foundations of the economic assessment of the cost of land and the methods for valuation of environmentally significant factors. According to the agricultural and natural-economic zoning of the East Siberian region, the Republic of Tyva is assigned to the steppe sheep-breeding and cattle-breeding zone. For the purpose of a more rational distribution and scientifically based specialization of agricultural production, the territory of Tuva is divided into four agricultural zones (Economics of the Tuva ASSR, 1973). The agricultural lands of the study area are included in the Central agricultural zone, mainly agricultural subtaiga, livestock-grain steppe and in the mainly livestock-grain Western agricultural zone. These are the largest, developed and densely populated parts of the republic, where most of the arable land, two-thirds of the hayfields and pastures, and more than 80\% of the population of the republic are concentrated. Territories of agricultural lands are located within the dry-steppe, steppe and forest-steppe natural and climatic zones. The climate is characterized by the highest degree of aridity. The main types of soils on arable land are chestnut sandy loamy soils that are subject to wind erosion (60\%), chernozems (23\%), and alluvial soddy soils (15\%). The performed assessment shows that the total damage from soil degradation for the Central and Western agricultural zones of the republic is estimated at more than 3.5 bln rubles, which is about one-third of the cost of agricultural land of the republic. A decrease in the cost of land for the period from 2012 to 2017 was revealed for the Tandinskii (54.1\%) and Chedi-Kholskii districts (47.2\%), which is due to soil degradation.",environmental and economic assessment; soil degradation; agricultural zone; basin; Tyva Republic,2022,12,4,10.1134/S2079096122040199,2079-0961,19,127,284,1866,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ARID ECOSYSTEMS,Halocnemeta strobilacei Formation in the Caspian Lowland: Ecological-Phytocoenotic Classification and Characteristic Plant Communities,"The Halocnemeta strobilacei formation in the Caspian Lowland is represented in European Russia by four classes of associations and 14 associations. Communities of Halocnemum strobilaceum are common in the desert and steppe zones have different species compositions and occupy different areas. Coenoses belonging to the Halocnemeta strobilacei pura classes of association are the most widespread. Communities of the following two class of associations are also typical for the study area: Halocnemeta strobilacei halosuf-fruticulosa and Halocnemeta strobilacei annulosa. Communities of another classes of association, Halocnemeta strobilacei graminosa occur rarely. Monodominant communities are confined to soils with high concentrations of chloride ions (Cl-).

ARID ECOSYSTEMS,The Winter Distribution of Young Greater Spotted Eagles (Clanga clanga) Marked with GPS-GSM Trackers in the European Part of Russia,"Using GPS-GSM trackers, data were obtained on the winter locations of four young Greater Spotted Eagles (Clanga clanga) in the center of the European part of Russia. The birds migrated to wintering areas located in the Middle East (Israel, northern Egypt, and Saudi Arabia), in southeastern Africa (Sudan and South Sudan), and also in southern Russia (the Republic of Adygea and Krasnodar Territory). The dates of arrival at the wintering grounds differed significantly and on average were October 27 (+/- 22 days), while departure occurred almost simultaneously, March 24 (+/- 3 days) on average. It has been established that, unlike the birds of western populations (Polish, Baltic and Belarusian), our Spotted Eagles flew from their wintering grounds later. According to the results of the research, an uneven distribution of Greater Spotted Eagles in the wintering areas was revealed. Most of the time, the birds kept to favorite places confined to both natural and anthropogenic wet habitats. During the entire wintering period, Greater Spotted Eagles used from 2 to 4 key areas, between which they periodically moved, only occasionally flying out of them.",Greater Spotted Eagle; Clanga clanga; wintering of birds; GPS-GSM telemetry; Central Russia,2022,12,3,10.1134/S207909612203012X,2079-0961,20,131,182,1161,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ARID ECOSYSTEMS,The State of Wild Tulips of the Northern Macroslope of Kyrgyz Ala-too in Relation to the Problem of their Disappearance,"Kyrgyzstan is very rich in bulbous plants. In general, the group of ephemeroids in Kyrgyzstan is widely represented and belongs to different taxa (families, genera, and species). This article discusses the current state of tulips on the northern macroslope of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too. Strong polymorphism, frequent hybridizations, especially among tulips, as well as a change in the color of flowers during drying of the herbarium, make the scientific identification of individual species quite difficult. This article presents the results of initial research and the annual regime of conservation of the tulip population in the eastern part of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too. According to the data we obtained, tulips are sensitive to the reserved regime. Vegetation monitoring was carried out on test plots, which were established in 2019, as well as on control plots. All trial sites are of the same dimension (10 x 10 m(2)). For semi-stationary monitoring, five test sites were allocated and they were fenced with chain-link mesh to protect against livestock. To carry out comparative characteristics and identify the stage of demutation of test sites, monitoring of ten control test sites was carried out in adjacent identical territories. The number of wild tulips in the fenced trial plots of 1 year ago is much higher than in the control plots. The protected regime for 1 year had a favorable effect on the vegetation cover of the mid-mountain altitudinal zone. In a short period of time, a demutation stage is observed for the entire floristic composition of the communities. The short-term (1 year) reserve regime had a positive effect on the floristic composition of communities, the projective cover of the herbage, an increase in the abundance of wild tulips, and contributed to the accumulation of steppe felt.",ephemeroids; tulip; subendemics; anthropogenic impact; test plot; control plot; fruit-bearing individuals; enclosure; demutation; total projective cover,2022,12,4,10.1134/S2079096122040084,2079-0961,20,119,288,1807,10,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ARID ECOSYSTEMS,Water Regime Types in Sand Massifs of the Don River Basin,"Under conditions of an arid climate and insufficient moisture supply for plants, the study of soil and the hydrological features of sand massifs becomes relevant. The purpose of this study was to investigate water regime types in sand massifs of the Don River basin. During 2003-2021, route and stationary (laying out of water regime sites) surveys were arranged on the territory of sand massifs of the river and its tributaries. Laboratory studies were carried out at the hydrological complex of the Federal Scientific Center of Agroecology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which included eight large lysimeters and 18 vegetation sites. Infiltration in open sands reached 70\% of the annual precipitation volume on average. The maximum runoff to the groundwater was observed for sand massifs of the Upper Don. According to lysimetric studies, the average annual intensity of the groundwater runoff under black fallow conditions was 0.73 mm/day for sand soils (the highest value), 0.65 mm/day for sandy loam soils, and 0.37 mm/day for loamy soils. At the same time, in the second half of the year, sandy loam soils were able to discharge more water into the groundwater than sandy and loamy soils. A nonflushing water regime was observed mainly on the third terrace of sandy massifs characterized by deep groundwater occurrence (>8 m) and soils with a heavy granulometric composition. Daily fluctuations of the groundwater level with the general decrease of this index were observed in the areas, where groundwater was available for tree roots, since the night water inflow did not compensate for transpiration water flow. The seasonal fluctuations of the groundwater level in the sands of the Don basin areas were 40-60 cm on average, but can also reach 90 cm.",sand massifs; water regime; soil and hydrological constants; groundwater runoff; lysimeters,2022,12,4,10.1134/S2079096122040102,2079-0961,11,57,285,1764,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ARID ECOSYSTEMS,The Status of Salsola arbusculiformis and Anabasis salsa Shrub Grasslands on the Ustyurt Plateau in Karakalpakstan (Uzbekistan),"The current grassland covered with Salsola arbusculiformis and Anabasis salsa shrubs, which is typical for the Ustyurt plateau surface land in Karakalpakia (Usbekistan), has been described. The results of nature surveys of the species composition and the forage yields of plant communities defined by dominant S. arbusculiformis are reported. The causes that contributed to the differences between the data produced in these surveys and the data reported by the Karakalpak researchers in the 1970s was considered. The grasslands are widely distributed throughout the Ustyurt plateau in Karakalpakia, covering half of its northern and eastern areas (1 291 414 ha), typically on gravel-loamy brackish-fissured gravelly clay, loamy, and gypsum soils. These grasslands comprise four vegetation communites: Artemisia terrae-albae Salsola arbusculiformis (Salsola arbusculiformis, Artemisia terrae-albae, Atraphaxis spinosa, and Convolvulus fruticosus) containing Zaisan saxaul (Haloxylon ammodendron), Artemisia terrae-albae Salsola arbusculiformis (Salsola arbusculiformis, Artemisia terrae-albae) containing a) Convolvulus fruticosus, Rheum tataricum, Stipa richteriana, and b) Anabasis brachiata, Anabasis salsa Salsola arbusculiformis (Salsola arbusculiformis, Anabasis salsa) containing Zaisan saxual (Haloxylon ammodendron), and shrub (Salsola arbusculiformis, Atraphaxis spinosa, Convolvulus fruticosus). The areas of the analyzed grassland communities, soil types, projective cover percentage, landscape plant species, their distribution patterns, forage yields, and seasonality as recommended for use have been determined. The monotony of the plant composition tends to remain due to the complexes of Caroxylon arborescens, Anabasi salsa, and sagebrush communities. Over a year of observations (2021), a poor annual growth rate under 1 cm in the dominant species (S. arbusculiformis and Artemisia terrae-albae) because of the lack of water was recorded, as they were stressed. The seasonal forage yield of the Salsola arbusculiformis and Anabasis salsa shrub pasture varies in the range of 0.5 centner/ha to 3.5 centner/ha. The highest yield is recorded in the autumn season. According to evaluation of the forage yield from grazing herbal leys (centner/ha), the studied grassland communities are recommended for use for autumn-winter grazing.",Republic of Karakalpakstan; Ustyurt Plateau; desertification; grassland community; degradation; vegetation cover; forage yield,2022,12,3,10.1134/S2079096122030106,2079-0961,17,127,314,2347,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ARID ECOSYSTEMS,Features of the Interannual and Seasonal Dynamics of the Ecological State of Salt Lakes under the Arid Climate of Crimea,"Unique lakes of various genesis are found on the Crimean Peninsula, which have a high recreational and balneological potential. They are under a significant anthropogenic load, which, along with the arid climate, leads to negative consequences for the ecosystems and even to the loss of biological and hydro-mineral resources. More than this, the closely located water bodies can differ significantly due to differences in human activities. Lake Moinaki on the western outskirts of Yevpatoria is divided by a sand barrier into two reservoirs, Moinaki-1 (larger) and Moinaki-2 (smaller). The aim of this work was to study some physicochemical parameters of water (temperature, pH, oxygen content, salinity, and redox potential, Eh) and Artemia population (Artemia salina (L, 1758)) in these water bodies in 2018-2020. The seasonal dynamics of the studied parameters has been characterized by an increase in salinity and Eh in summer resulted from an increase in air and water temperature and its intense evaporation. Simultaneously, a decrease in oxygen content and as well as in pH levels has been observed. The identified features were more pronounced in Moinaki-2 than in Moinaki-1. Artemia cysts were found in both reservoirs, while nauplii and adults were found only in Moinaki-2 in 2020, after drying and subsequent restoration of the hydrological regime of the water body.",hypersaline lakes; Crimea; oxygen content; salinity; pH; Eh,2022,12,3,10.1134/S2079096122030118,2079-0961,20,120,213,1378,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,"Aridity mediates the effect of wood extraction on the reproductive output of an endemic disturbance-adapted woody species (Cenostigma microphyllum, Leguminosae) in the Caatinga dry forest","Chronic anthropogenic disturbances and climate change have been recognized as drivers of biological reorganization across human-modified tropical landscapes, also negatively affecting the reproductive output of some plant species. Here, we investigated to what extent these drivers affect the reproductive output of Cenostigma microphyllum, a disturbance-adapted tree species endemic to the Caatinga dry forest. The production of flowers/inflorescence, fruits and seeds was estimated for 105 plants (>= 3 cm diameter at soil height) across 11 forest stands (20 x 50 m each), covering gradients of chronic disturbances (e.g. goat and livestock herbivory; wood extraction; and removal of non-timber forest products) and aridity at the Catimbau National Park. We documented that when the drivers were analysed in isolation, the fruit-set was positively associated with increased wood extraction, and the fruit-set and total number of seeds/plots were reduced under increasing aridity. We also verified a complex interaction between wood extraction and aridity emerged. In forest stands, the combination of high levels of aridity and wood extraction leads to a decrease in the fruit-set and total number of seeds/plots. Conversely, the fruit-set and total number of seeds/plots increased in stands exposed to lower aridity but high levels of wood extraction. Our results suggest that chronic disturbances and aridity affect plant fitness in a complex way including both negative and positive effects on attributes related to plant reproductive performance, which could result in both proliferation and population decline in the same landscape. Although C. microphyllum benefits from anthropogenic disturbances and is considered a disturbance-adapted species, it apparently does not benefit from increases in aridity, which is an expected future scenario for the Caatinga dry forest.",chronic disturbances; fruit-set; pollination; seasonally dry tropical forests; water deficit,2023,48,2,10.1111/aec.13265,1442-9985,25,187,270,1878,5,15,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Drivers of collapse of fire-killed trees,"Large quantities of dead wood can be generated by disturbances such as wildfires. Dead trees created by disturbances play many critical ecological roles in forest ecosystems globally. The ability of deadwood to serve its ecological roles is contingent, in part, on the length of time trees remain standing following disturbance. Here, we briefly outline the results of a 10-year study that aimed to quantify the rate of collapse of trees killed in a major wildfire in the wet ash forests of mainland south-eastern Australia. We also quantified the factors associated with dead tree collapse. Our analyses revealed that 23\% of 417 measured trees collapsed between 2011 and 2021. The most parsimonious model of the factors influencing tree collapse revealed a strong effect of diameter; smaller diameter trees were more likely to collapse over the 10 years of our study than larger diameter trees. In addition, trees in small and large patches were more likely to collapse than trees in contiguous forest (where there had been no logging in the surrounding area). If current rates of tree fall are maintained, then many of trees initially measured will have collapsed by 2030. Such losses of dead trees will have major negative effects on key values of ash-type forests such as biodiversity conservation.",Fire; tree collapse; South eastern Australia,2023,48,"1, SI",10.1111/aec.13256,1442-9985,6,40,210,1303,3,15,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Living on the edge: The use of fruit-feeding butterflies to evaluate edge effect on subtropical assemblages,"This study evaluated how the edge effect influences the structuration of fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages in swamp forest fragments of the subtropical Atlantic Forest, Southern Brazil. Sampling was carried out twice in 10 fragments using baited traps placed in sampling units both at the forest edge and 50 m within the forest interior, with the habitats being defined by a set of environmental variables. Richness and abundance were higher for edge habitats with an effect of temperature depending on humidity and luminosity. The subfamily/tribe composition of fruit-feeding butterflies was segregated between edge and interior and was predicted by wind speed and the interaction between humidity and luminosity. Fifty meters within the forest interior is not sufficient to cause homogenization of butterfly composition between the edge and interior of swamp forest fragments, indicating distinct assemblages in each habitat.

AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,"Population size and survival of the Brazilian Torrent Frog Hylodes heyeri (Anura, Hylodidae)","Population dynamics are influenced by environmental variability and understanding the abundance and persistence of individuals and populations is a fundamental goal of population ecology. Thus, estimating demographic parameters to identify the factors important for population variability is required to understand temporal and spatial dynamics. The stream-living diurnal frog Hylodes heyeri is endemic to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil in the states of Parana, Sao Paulo and Santa Catarina. Here we use capture-mark-recapture methods to estimate survival rates and population size of this Brazilian Torrent Frog in Pico do Marumbi State Park, Parana. We used CJS models for an open population to estimate apparent survival, capturability and population size in two streams. The number of captures during each session was positively correlated with the minimum weekly temperature. Despite that correlation, the most parsimonious model of survival and capturability was the constant model for both parameters, resulting in a monthly survival rate of 0.38 (95\% CI = 0.30-0.46). Thus, only the abundance of the frog differed in the two streams (79 vs. 36), with the population size estimate of 187 individuals. Reproduction is seasonal in the Brazilian Torrent Frog and so the low monthly survival rate suggests that animals move over time rather than die, because 38\% month(-1) survival should result in <1\% of the population remaining after 5 months. Thus, researchers must recognize that populations are labile and individuals often move or are washed downstream during heavy rainfall, generating apparently rapid local turnover that is unlikely to reflect true mortality.",anurans; capturability; demography; mark-recapture; population dynamics,2023,48,"1, SI",10.1111/aec.13254,1442-9985,13,92,249,1674,5,15,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,"Problem solving of wild animals in the Wet Tropics of Queensland, Australia","While many species of animals can solve food-baited problems, most studies are conducted in captivity, which may not reflect the natural behavioural and cognitive abilities of wild animals. As few studies have explored problem solving of Australian animals generally, we investigated the problem solving abilities of native Australian species in natural rainforest in the Wet Tropics of Queensland. We baited multiple types of puzzles (matchbox task, cylinder task, and tile and lever tasks on a Trixie Dog Activity Board) with different food types (seeds, fruit, sardines) and placed the puzzles in front of trail cameras. We noted the species captured on camera, whether or not individuals interacted with the puzzles, the number of interactions with puzzles, and whether or not different animals solved them. We found that seven species from multiple taxa (mammals, birds, reptiles) could solve food-baited problems in the wild, providing the first evidence of problem solving in these native species. As problem solving may help animals cope with anthropogenic threats, these results provide some insights into which Wet Tropics species may potentially be more vulnerable and which ones might be better at coping with changing conditions.",behavioural flexibility; cognition; innovation; novel object; rainforest,2023,48,2,10.1111/aec.13270,1442-9985,12,75,189,1242,5,15,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Response of the dung beetle community to different climatic zones: Does the land use system matter?,"The conversion of Brazilian savanna into exotic pastures leads to the loss of dung beetles and a decrease in their contribution to ecological functions. We hypothesized that the dung beetle communities from exotic pastures would show greater significant differences between climatic zones, when contrasted to communities from Brazilian savanna in the same region, since dung beetle assemblages in pastures are more simplified. We assessed which variables (purpose of production, type of management, percentage the habitat per buffer, soil penetration resistance, pasture area and herd size) affect more the dung beetle community in exotic pastures. We carried out this study in 48 areas of native Brazilian savannas and exotic pastures distributed across four bioclimatic zones: BZ1, hot with three dry months; BZ2, hot with 4-5 dry months; BZ3, sub-hot with 4-5 dry months and BZ4, meso-thermal with 4-5 dry months of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. In each BZ, six areas of Brazilian savannas and six areas of exotic pasture were selected. In the Brazilian savanna areas, the species richness, abundance and biomass of dung beetles did not differ between the bioclimatic zones, unlike the exotic pastures. The composition of the dung beetle community was different between land use systems and between bioclimatic zones; the interaction between the two factors was also significant. Our results provide evidence that dung beetle communities active in exotic pastures are more susceptible to climatic environmental variations than communities from more complex and stable habitats, such as savannas. Finally, the best model suggested that all the six variables combined explained about 91\% of the total variability in species composition observed between sampling sites.",biodiversity conservation; bioindicator; pastures; savanna; Scarabaeinae,2023,48,2,10.1111/aec.13267,1442-9985,16,99,266,1768,5,15,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Species distribution modelling of the endangered Mahogany Glider (Petaurus gracilis) reveals key areas for targeted survey and conservation,"The Mahogany Glider (Petaurus gracilis) is one of the most endangered marsupials in Australia. Its known distribution is an approximately 120 km strip of fragmented coastal woodland in north-east Queensland, from north of Townsville to the Tully area. Records are clustered in a number of well-surveyed areas, with significant areas of lowland habitat unsurveyed. Around 30\% of historic records fall in areas that were subsequently cleared for farmland, and ongoing clearing and fragmentation of lowland sclerophyll forest continues within the potential distribution. Resolving the distribution is an urgent requirement to guide conservation but Mahogany Gliders are difficult to detect in the field. Species distribution modelling offers a technique for estimating the fine-scale distribution and for targeting further field survey and conservation efforts. We used known occurrence records (N = 481) to predict the distribution of Mahogany Gliders across the Wet Tropics bioregion. We used climatic, topographic and other environmental predictors to generate distribution models using Maxent and Random Forest algorithms, each with two bias correction methods. The predictions revealed that many unknown populations may exist within the currently defined distribution and in important areas beyond this (e.g. Hinchinbrook Island). There was reasonable congruence between models, and we include syntheses of the models to present the most likely current distribution. The most important predictor variables across the models were precipitation seasonality (high seasonality), elevation (generally <100 m), soil type (hydrosols) and vegetation type (including Eucalyptus and Melaleuca woodlands). Our results identify core habitat and reveal key areas that require targeted field surveys. Importantly, the predicted suitable habitat is highly fragmented and ongoing conservation efforts need to improve habitat connectivity and limit further fragmentation.",Australian Wet Tropics; fragmentation; Mahogany Glider; Maxent; Random Forest; road bias,2023,48,2,10.1111/aec.13266,1442-9985,18,139,272,1957,6,15,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,An ephemerality paradox: Evidence of virtual semelparity in ephemeral pool-breeding anurans,"Oviparous species that reproduce in unpredictably variable environments risk depositing their eggs in situations that may become unsuitable for offspring survival at any time. This uncertainty often leads to selection for iteroparity as a form of bet-hedging to spread offspring development spatially and temporally, thereby improving the odds of some cohorts experiencing optimal conditions. Paradoxically, an iteroparous mode appears to be the exception for a small number of amphibians that exploit temporary aquatic systems. In this study, we provide evidence of this paradox in an Australian anuran, the sandpaper frog, Lechriodus fletcheri, which breeds almost exclusively in small, highly ephemeral pools that often dry before the completion of tadpole development. A capture-mark-recapture study was conducted on a population over three consecutive breeding seasons, to determine how often adults returned to breeding sites within and between years and the extent of iteroparity. We found practically no adult returns between seasons, even though recapture events often occurred within season, suggesting that this species is virtually semelparous. A similar life history is apparent in other amphibians, suggesting that some species are able to persist in unpredictable environments by likely taking advantage of other forms of bet-hedging in the absence of iteroparity. For L. fletcheri, we suggest that an extended breeding season may lend itself to the process of cohort splitting at a population level, resulting in the future reproductive activity of offspring from each generation being spread across multiple seasons. Our study shows how an iteroparous life history is not the only way to deal with environmental uncertainty.",amphibian; bet-hedging; cohort splitting; semelparous life history; variable environment,2022,47,8,10.1111/aec.13246,1442-9985,11,91,255,1741,5,15,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Drought limits large trees in African savannas with or without elephants,"Consumers, including megaherbivores and fire, are considered important limiting forces for woody plants and canopy closure in African savannas. However, climatic events like drought can also play a significant role in limiting trees and maintaining tree-grass coexistence in savannas. The extent to which top-down control (e.g. megaherbivores) and bottom-up resource limitation through drought and competition interact to influence savanna tree mortality and woody structure is unclear. Here, we compared the change in the number of large trees before and after a severe drought in a savanna with elephants (Loxodonta africana) and one without elephants. Elephants and drought both limited the number of large trees at our sites, but contrary to our predictions, there was no interactive effect of these drivers on overall changes in tree densities. However, there was a synergistic effect on the dominant tree species, Senegalia nigrescens, such that tree loss post-drought was greater where elephants were present compared to where they were absent. Hence, our results suggest that species-specific differences in drought resistance, as well as density-dependent factors, likely impact the severity of drought effects on savanna tree communities. In savannas, drought has the potential to exert strong control on tree survival and prevent canopy closure, thus partially filling the role of megaherbivores in limiting large trees when these consumers are absent. As drought severity and frequency are predicted to increase in the future, the influence of drought on savanna vegetation structure becomes increasingly important to consider.",tree loss; Loxodonta africana; Senegalia nigrescens; climate; herbivory,2022,47,8,10.1111/aec.13244,1442-9985,11,72,240,1639,5,15,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Effect of forest areas configuration on the community of insectivorous bats in agroforestry landscapes,"In Chile, many aspects of the ecology of bats and their distribution are unknown, despite their ecological and economic importance. This situation does not allow a correct implementation of conservation efforts even when they are legally recognized as beneficial animals for agriculture. Here, we studied the bats' activity and community in two agricultural landscape types (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous) in a hotspot of biodiversity in the centre-south of Chile. We monitored four transects of 10 km per landscape type with 10 listening points separated by 1 km. These transects were repeated 5 times, once per month. We evaluated the bats activity according to the forest cover type (native, mixed and plantations) and the isolated trees density. Our results showed that the heterogeneous landscape was dominated by T. brasiliensis while the homogeneous landscape was by Lasiurus spp. However, only the species T. brasiliensis was affected by the landscape type. In the heterogeneous landscape, only the forest cover variables had significance in the activity of the bat species, where Lasiurus spp. and M. chiloensis had a positive response for native and mixed forest, as well as Lasiurus spp. had a negative response for plantations. The density of isolated trees had a negative effect on the activity of T. brasiliensis and Lasiurus spp. in the homogeneous landscape type.

AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Ineffectiveness of ants in protecting two sympatric myrmecophilous plants against endophytic beetles,"Extrafloral nectarized plants attract ants, which may protect them against herbivory and increase plant fruit set production. In some cases, however, ants are ineffective against herbivores. Such events occur, for instance, when herbivores present adaptations to avoid ant predation. Thus, the outputs of these interactions depend on factors such as ant identity, plant phenology and herbivore features. Here, we investigated the endophytic florivorous beetles' impact on the reproductive success of their host plants, two sympatric Banisteriopsis (Malpighiaceae) species, depending on the action of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) visiting ants. We experimentally manipulated the presence of ants and herbivores on B. malifolia and B. laevifolia species during their reproductive period to test the effectiveness of ants-EFNs mutualism on plant fruit set production. We performed treatments where three similar inflorescences were selected to be (I) control branch, with no manipulations, (II) beetle-free branch, isolated with textile cover and (III) ant-free branch, isolated at the base with atoxic wax. We hypothesized that endophytic herbivores have a negative impact on the plant reproductive success because they escape the action of ants (biotic defences). As a result, we observed (i) that florivorous Anthonomus beetles have a negative impact on Banisteriopsis reproductive success; (ii) ants fail in protecting plants against floral endophytic beetles; and (iii) most of the results were species-specific. Our results indicate that these systems present very conditional outcomes that depend on the intrinsic factors of each plant species.",asymmetric system; biotic defence; context dependency; extrafloral nectaries; trophic cascade,2022,NA,NA,10.1111/aec.13262,1442-9985,12,100,234,1648,5,15,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Interspecific variation in fish spatial synchrony relates to reproductive traits in a highly fragmented river,"Spatial synchrony occurs when the abundance of populations in different locations rise and fall together. This pattern is caused mainly by dispersal and spatially correlated environmental stochasticity. The levels of spatial synchrony can vary between species, yet little is known about which species traits can explain this interspecific variation. In addition, traits may have different degrees of influence on spatial synchrony levels because of their differences in plasticity. We hypothesized that conservative traits-reproductive and morphological-will best explain interspecific variation in synchrony, while those that may vary according to the environment-feeding and habitat preference-will be weakly related to this interspecific variation. We evaluated the spatial synchrony of freshwater fish species in a highly fragmented river in the Neotropical region and related the levels of synchrony to seven predictors: diet, reproductive traits (migration, fecundation, parental care and spawning), position in the water column, niche breadth, body size, body shape and average temporal occurrence of each species. The fish species showed low levels of spatial synchrony but a high interspecific variation (correlation values ranging from -0.11 to 0.41). We found that this variation was mainly related to species' reproductive traits, that is, sedentary species with partial spawning and without parental care had higher mean spatial synchrony than species with the opposite characteristics. In contrast, more plastic traits (diet and habitat preferences) were poor predictors of mean spatial synchrony. We speculate that, despite the low spatial synchrony found, if extreme impacts continue to occur in the basin at the regional scale, it may negatively affect local fish populations in a synchronous manner, resulting in increased risk of simultaneous declines.",dispersal; fish migration; functional traits; Moran effect; population synchrony,2022,47,8,10.1111/aec.13241,1442-9985,15,109,265,1871,5,15,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,Male agility in relation to mating success in two non-territorial damselflies,"Male body size is usually correlated with mating success in insects. For non-territorial species, the small male advantage hypothesis predicts that smaller males may be favoured in sexual selection because small body size may predict agility and manoeuvrability. Consequently, selection for male size may drive the evolution of female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Nevertheless, recent evidence shows that non-territorial male damselflies that actively search for females may be larger and more agile than those that perch and wait for females to appear. Thus, here we addressed whether the male size is an indicator of male agility and if it may be used to predict male reproductive success in two non-territorial damselflies. To this end, we conducted a field study with Acanthagrion truncatum Selys, 1876 and A. lancea Selys, 1876 (Zygoptera, Coenagrionidae). Males of A. truncatum adopt a sit-and-wait mating strategy, while the males actively search for females in A. lancea. Hence, we expected different selective forces acting on male body size and agility in these species. We compared the body size and wing length of mated and unmated males, and between sexes, to describe their patterns of SSD. Our results suggest that wing length can be used as a proxy for male body size and agility in both species. However, we have found no evidence for the small male advantage that could explain wing dimorphism in A. truncatum, nor selection for larger males in A. lancea. In conclusion, this study corroborates other studies that suggest agility cannot explain SSD in non-territorial damselflies and fail to support the small male advantage hypothesis.",aerodynamics; allometry; Coenagrionidae; flight; reproductive behaviour; sexual selection,2022,47,8,10.1111/aec.13240,1442-9985,11,77,261,1662,6,15,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

At the regional level, the cladoceran Daphnia spinulata is found in numerous habitats with wide conductivity range (160 mu S cm(-1) to 14.000 mu S cm(-1)), but information about the species's tolerance range or life history is scarce. Our objective was to generate essential information about D. spinulata's life history and the main parameters related to two contrasting salinity levels representative of water bodies of the pampean plain. Results obtained in laboratory bioassays showed that individuals at low conductivity (700 mu S cm(-1)) had more moults, a lower mortality and a higher life expectancy at birth, a higher generation time, and an earlier peak density than those at high-conductivity treatments (5000 mu S cm(-1)). The maximum density reached was similar for both conductivities indicating a similar growth capability attained by different strategies. Moreover, the results indicated that D. spinulata at different conductivities was able to reproduce, with the offspring thus contributing to population growth. This study provided a knowledge of the life history strategies of this endemic cladoceran at two different conductivities, thus generating crucial information on the population dynamics and for evaluating the species's role as a possible salinity indicator in pampean water bodies.

AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY,An integrative taxonomic approach resolves the Prostanthera lasianthos (Lamiaceae) species complex,"The diagnostic characteristics and distinctiveness of plant taxa have traditionally been based on a combination of geographic and morphological discontinuity.

AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY,"Fassettia, a new North American genus of family Ceratophyllaceae: evidence based on cladistic analyses of current molecular data of Ceratophyllum","The major goal of this study was to re-analyse a published molecular dataset based on ITS and matK sequences of the genus Ceratophyllum (Ceratophyllaceae) within a cladistic framework, operating only with rooted trees. The problem is lack of an identifiable suitable outgroup to Ceratophyllum. We show different ways to root trees and thus resolve the sister group relationships within this genus. We root the trees using an all zero outgroup or a combination of exemplar taxa from among monocots (Acorus), eudcots (Ranunculus) and Chloranthus. Ceratophyllum echinatum was consistently strongly supported as sister to all of the remaining taxa of the genus. This observation is congruent with the earlier results of Les who noted the uniqueness of C. echinatum in a series of comprehensive morphological and biosystematic studies. We, here, transfer C. echinatum to a new and presumably monotypic genus Fassettia Mavrodiev.

BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,An arachnid's guide to being an ant: morphological and behavioral mimicry in ant-mimicking spiders,"Batesian mimicry imposes several challenges to mimics and evokes adaptations in multiple sensory modalities. Myrmecomorphy, morphological and behavioral resemblance to ants, is seen in over 2000 arthropod species. Ant-like resemblance is observed in at least 13 spider families despite spiders having a distinct body plan compared to ants. Quantifying the extent to which spiders' shape, size, and behavior resemble model ants will allow us to comprehend the evolutionary pressures that have facilitated myrmecomorphy. Myrmaplata plataleoides are thought to closely resemble weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina. In this study, we quantify the speed of movement of model, mimic, and non-mimetic jumping spiders. We use traditional and geometric morphometrics to quantify traits such as foreleg size and hindleg size, body shape between the model ant, mimic, and non-mimics. Our results suggest that while the mimics closely resemble the model ants in speed of movement, they occupy an intermediate morphological space compared to the model ants and non-mimics. Ant-mimicking spiders are better at mimicking ants' locomotory movement than morphology and overall body shape. Some traits may compensate others, suggesting differential selection on these mimetic traits. Our study provides a framework to understand the multimodal nature of mimicry and helps discern the relative contributions of such traits that drive mimetic accuracy in ant-mimicking spiders. Mimicry provides a textbook example of adaptation by natural selection. Ant-like resemblance is observed in 13 spider families despite spiders having a distinct body plan compared to ants. Jumping spiders, Myrmaplata plataleoides, closely resemble weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina. We quantified movement, leg size and body shape of model ants, mimics, and non-mimics.

BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Can native predators be used as a stepping stone to reduce prey naivety to novel predators?,"Lay Summary Prey species that are naive to novel predators are at increased risk of predation and potential extinction. We showed that exposure of prey to a native predator can improve anti-predator traits compared to naive prey. However, these behavioral advantages may not be a useful stepping stone for exposure to a novel predator if the novel and native predators are behaviorally distinct. Predator naivety negatively affects reintroduction success, and this threat is exacerbated when prey encounters predators with which they have had no evolutionary experience. While methods have been developed to inculcate fear into such predator-naive individuals, none have been uniformly successful. Exposing ontogenetically- and evolutionary-naive individuals first to native predators may be an effective stepping stone to improved responses to evolutionarily novel predators. We focused on greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis) and capitalized on a multi-year mammalian recovery experiment whereby western quolls (Dasyurus geoffroii) were reintroduced into parts of a large fenced reserve that contained a population of naive bilbies. We quantified a suite of anti-predator behaviors and measures of general wariness across quoll-exposed and quoll-naive bilby populations. We then translocated both quoll-exposed and quoll-naive individuals into a large enclosure that contained feral cats (Felis catus) and monitored several behaviors. We found that bilbies can respond appropriately to quolls but found only limited support that experience with quolls better-prepared bilbies to respond to cats. Both populations of bilbies rapidly modified their behavior in a similar manner after their reintroduction to a novel environment. These results may have emerged due to insufficient prior exposure to quolls, inappropriate behavioral tests, or insufficient predation risk during cat exposure. Alternatively, quolls and cats are only distantly related and may not share sufficient similarities in their predatory cues or behavior to support such a learning transfer. Testing this stepping stone hypothesis with more closely related predator species and under higher predation risk would be informative.",anti-predator trait; greater bilby; marsupial; neophobia; predator-prey,2023,34,1,10.1093/beheco/arac097,1045-2249,16,91,311,2196,5,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Group social structure has limited impact on reproductive success in a wild mammal,"The frequency and type of dyadic social interactions individuals partake in has important fitness consequences. Social network analysis is an effective tool to quantify the complexity and consequences of these behaviors on the individual level. Less work has used social networks to quantify the social structure-specific attributes of the pattern of all social interactions in a network-of animal social groups, and its fitness consequences for those individuals who comprise the group. We studied the association between social structure, quantified via five network measures, and annual reproductive success in wild, free-living female yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer). We quantified reproductive success in two ways: (1) if an individual successfully weaned a litter and (2) how many pups were weaned. Networks were constructed from 38 968 interactions between 726 unique individuals in 137 social groups across 19 years. Using generalized linear mixed models, we found largely no relationship between either measure of reproductive success and social structure. We found a modest relationship that females residing in more fragmentable social groups (i.e., groups breakable into two or more separate groups of two or more individuals) weaned larger litters. Prior work showed that yellow-bellied marmots residing in more fragmentable groups gained body mass faster-another important fitness correlate. Interestingly, we found no strong relationships between other attributes of social group structure, suggesting that in this facultatively social mammal, the position of individuals within their group, the individual social phenotype, may be more important for fitness than the emergent group social phenotype. Lay Summary How individuals interact with other members of their own species often has fitness consequences. Such interactions also structure social groups, which may in turn affect the individuals who reside in the group. Using social network analysis to quantify social group structure, we show that female yellow-bellied marmots living in more fragmentable social groups (breakable into two or more separate groups of two or more individuals) weaned larger litters.",fitness consequences; long-term study; social mammal; social network analysis; social structure; yellow-bellied marmot,2023,34,1,10.1093/beheco/arac102,1045-2249,13,82,315,2197,6,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"Higher ultraviolet skin reflectance signals submissiveness in the anemonefish, Amphiprion akindynos","When signaling submission, it is important to wave the ``white flag.{'' In the Barrier Reef anemonefish, ultraviolet color patterns serve to signal submissiveness. In staged contests over dominance between size-matched anemonefish, low ultraviolet skin reflectance strongly predicted fish winning a contest, while high UV skin reflectance predicted losing. We demonstrate that juvenile subordinates benefit by signaling their submissiveness with a naturally higher ultraviolet skin reflectance which evokes less aggression from larger, more-dominant fish and likely aids with social group integration. Ultraviolet (UV) vision is widespread among teleost fishes, of which many exhibit UV skin colors for communication. However, aside from its role in mate selection, few studies have examined the information UV signaling conveys in other socio-behavioral contexts. Anemonefishes (subfamily, Amphiprioninae) live in a fascinating dominance hierarchy, in which a large female and male dominate over non-breeding subordinates, and body size is the primary cue for dominance. The iconic orange and white bars of anemonefishes are highly UV-reflective, and their color vision is well tuned to perceive the chromatic contrast of skin, which we show here decreases in the amount of UV reflectance with increasing social rank. To test the function of their UV-skin signals, we compared the outcomes of staged contests over dominance between size-matched Barrier Reef anemonefish (Amphiprion akindynos) in aquarium chambers viewed under different UV-absorbing filters. Fish under UV-blocking filters were more likely to win contests, where fish under no-filter or neutral-density filter were more likely to submit. For contests between fish in no-filter and neutral density filter treatments, light treatment had no effect on contest outcome (win/lose). We also show that sub-adults were more aggressive toward smaller juveniles placed under a UV filter than a neutral density filter. Taken together, our results show that UV reflectance or UV contrast in anemonefish can modulate aggression and encode dominant and submissive cues, when changes in overall intensity are controlled for.",Clownfish; color; contest; reef fish; social communication; vision,2023,34,1,10.1093/beheco/arac089,1045-2249,11,99,312,2177,6,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Ineffective integration of multiple anti-predator defenses in a rotifer: a low-cost insurance?,"To maximize survival, prey often integrates multiple anti-predator defenses. How the defenses interact to reduce predation risk is, however, poorly known. We used the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus to investigate how morphological (spines) and behavioral (floating) defenses are integrated against a common predatory rotifer, Asplanchna brightwellii, and if their combined use improves survival. To this end, we assessed the cost of the behavioral defense and the efficiency of both defenses, individually and combined, as well as their mutual dependency. The results show that the behavioral defense is costly in reducing foraging activity, and that the two defenses are used simultaneously, with the presence of the morphological defense enhancing the use of the behavioral defense, as does the pre-exposure to predator cues. However, while the morphological defense reduces predation risk, the behavioral defense does not, thus, adding the costly behavioral defense to the morphological defense does not improve survival. It is likely that the cost of the behavioral defense is low given its reversibility-compared to the cost of misidentifying the predator species-and that this has promoted the adoption of both defenses, as general low-cost insurance rather than as a tailored strategy toward specific predators. Thus, the optimal strategy in the rotifer appears to be to express both morphological and behavioral defenses when confronted with the cues of a potential predator. When predators are around, no effort should be spared in defending oneself. We show that the rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus, uses both spines on its body and floating behavior to defend itself when exposed to predator cues. However, only spines are needed to reduce predation risk. It seems likely that the low cost of floating has promoted its adoption, in addition to the possession of spines: it offers a general low-cost insurance against predation.",behavioral defenses; morphological defenses; phenotypic plasticity; predator-prey interactions; predatory cues,2023,34,1,10.1093/beheco/arac106,1045-2249,12,94,291,1940,5,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Anthropogenic noise and light alter temporal but not spatial breeding behavior in a wild frog,"Increasing urbanization has led to large-scale land-use changes, exposing persistent populations to drastically altered environments. Sensory pollutants, including low-frequency anthropogenic noise and artificial light at night (ALAN), are typically associated with urban environments and known to impact animal populations in a variety of ways. Both ALAN and anthropogenic noise can alter behavioral and physiological processes important for survival and reproduction, including communication and circadian rhythms. Although noise and light pollution typically co-occur in urbanized areas, few studies have addressed their combined impact on species' behavior. Here, we assessed how anthropogenic noise and ALAN can influence spatial and temporal variation in breeding activity of a wild frog population. By exposing artificial breeding sites inside a tropical rainforest to multiple sensory environments, we found that both anthropogenic noise and ALAN impact breeding behavior of tungara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus), albeit in different ways. Males arrived later in the night at their breeding sites in response to anthropogenic noise. ALAN, on the other hand, led to an increase in calling effort. We found no evidence that noise or light pollution either attracted frogs to or repelled frogs from breeding sites. Thus, anthropogenic noise may negatively affect calling males by shifting the timing of sexual signaling. Conversely, ALAN may increase the attractiveness of calling males. These changes in breeding behavior highlight the complex ways that urban multisensory pollution can influence behavior and suggest that such changes may have important ecological implications for the wildlife that are becoming increasingly exposed to urban multisensory pollution. Urbanization exposes animal populations to sensory pollutants, including anthropogenic noise and artificial light, possibly affecting survival and reproductive success. We examined the effects of noise and light pollution on breeding behavior in a wild population of frogs. Frogs called later in the night with anthropogenic noise, potentially increasing predation and reducing reproductive success. Light increased the amount of frog calling, suggesting that light might play an important role in altering communication in urban frog populations.",anthropogenic noise; artificial light at night; breeding behavior; multisensory pollution; sexual communication; urbanization,2022,33,6,10.1093/beheco/arac077,1045-2249,15,93,323,2322,6,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Black and orange coloration predict success during male-male competition in the guppy,"Investigating how intrasexual competition and intersexual mate choice act within a system is crucial to understanding the maintenance and diversity of sexually-dimorphic traits. These two processes can act in concert by selecting for the same trait, or in opposition by selecting for different extremes of the same trait; they can also act on different traits, potentially increasing trait complexity. We asked whether male-male competition and female mate choice act on the same male traits using Trinidadian guppies, which exhibit sexual size dimorphism and male-limited color patterns consisting of different colors arranged along the body and fins. We used behavioral assays to assess the relationship between color and competitive success and then compared our results to the plethora of data on female choice and color in our study population. Males initiated more contests if they were larger than their competitor. Males won contests more often if they had more black coloration than their competitor, and the effect of black was stronger when males had less orange than their competitor. Additionally, males won more often if they had either more structural color (iridescence) and more orange, or less structural color and less orange than their competitor, suggesting multiple combinations of color traits predict success. Females from our study population exhibit a strong preference for more orange coloration. Thus, traits favored in male contests differ from those favored by intersexual selection in this population. These results suggest that inter- and intrasexual selection, when acting concurrently, can promote increased complexity of sexually selected traits. Mate choice and mate competition can favor different extremes of a trait, or different traits altogether. Female Trinidadian guppies from the Paria River prefer males with high amounts of orange color and large tail fins. Here, we show that male-male competition instead favors large males with more black and less orange on their body. The conflicting selection pressures generated by female choice and male-male competition may therefore explain the complexity of male guppy color pattern.",animal behavior; color polymorphism; intersexual mate choice; intrasexual competition; male contests; Poecilia reticulata,2022,33,6,10.1093/beheco/arac093,1045-2249,12,85,325,2173,6,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Breeding site fidelity is lower in polygamous shorebirds and male-biased in monogamous species,"Sex-bias in breeding dispersal is considered the norm in many taxa, and the magnitude and direction of such sex-bias is expected to correlate with the social mating system. We used local return rates in shorebirds as an index of breeding site fidelity, and hence as an estimate of the propensity for breeding dispersal, and tested whether variation in site fidelity and in sex-bias in site fidelity relates to the mating system. Among 111 populations of 49 species, annual return rates to a breeding site varied between 0\% and 100\%. After controlling for body size (linked to survival) and other confounding factors, monogamous species showed higher breeding site fidelity compared with polyandrous and polygynous species. Overall, there was a strong male bias in return rates, but the sex-bias in return rate was independent of the mating system and did not covary with the extent of sexual size dimorphism. Our results bolster earlier findings that the sex-biased dispersal is weakly linked to the mating system in birds. Instead, our results show that return rates are strongly correlated with the mating system in shorebirds regardless of sex. This suggests that breeding site fidelity may be linked to mate fidelity, which is only important in the monogamous, biparentally incubating species, or that the same drivers influence both the mating system and site fidelity. The strong connection between site fidelity and the mating system suggests that variation in site fidelity may have played a role in the coevolution of the mating system, parental care, and migration strategies. Birds may return to the same breeding site to reunite with their old partner. For migratory bird species, whether to return to the same site as last year to breed or disperse to a new site depends on their mating system. Among 49 species of shorebirds from around the globe, species that form an exclusive breeding pair returned to the previous breeding site more than species where one sex mates with multiple partners.",dispersal; mate fidelity; migration; return rate; sex-bias; site tenacity; shorebird; wader,2022,33,3,10.1093/beheco/arac014,1045-2249,13,94,325,2009,8,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Call combinations in chimpanzees: a social tool?,"Recent attention within the field of ageing has focused on the relationship between the age of parents and the quality of offspring, but the picture that is emerging is that the presence of this aspect of ageing is highly variable. We describe a laboratory experiment that independently measured effects of maternal and paternal age effects on the fitness traits of larvae and female foster mothers in a species of insect that feeds its young during their development as larvae. A growing body of evidence suggests the capacity for animals to combine calls into larger communicative structures is more common than previously assumed. Despite its cross-taxa prevalence, little is known regarding the evolutionary pressures driving such combinatorial abilities. One dominant hypothesis posits that social complexity and vocal complexity are linked, with changes in social structuring (e.g., group size) driving the emergence of ever-more complex vocal abilities, such as call sequencing. In this paper, we tested this hypothesis through investigating combinatoriality in the vocal system of the highly social chimpanzee. Specifically, we predicted combinatoriality to be more common in socially-driven contexts and in females and lower-ranked males (socially challenging contexts and socially challenged individuals respectively). Firstly, through applying methods from computational linguistics (i.e., collocation analyses), we built an objective repertoire of combinatorial structures in this species. Second, we investigated what potential factors influenced call combination production. We show that combinatoriality is predominant in 1) social contexts vs. non-social contexts, 2) females vs. males, and 3) negatively correlates with male rank. Together, these results suggest one function of combinatoriality in chimpanzees may be to help individuals navigate their dynamic social world. More generally, we argue these findings provide support for the hypothesized link between social and vocal complexity and can provide insight into the evolution of our own highly combinatorial communication system, language.",combinatoriality; evolution of language; non-human primates; Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii; social complexity hypothesis,2022,33,5,10.1093/beheco/arac074,1045-2249,7,48,300,2116,5,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Can you hear/see me? Multisensory integration of signals does not always facilitate mate choice,"Females of many species choose mates using multiple sensory modalities. Multimodal noise may arise, however, in dense aggregations of animals communicating via multiple sensory modalities. Some evidence suggests multimodal signals may not always improve receiver decision-making performance. When sensory systems process input from multimodal signal sources, multimodal noise may arise and potentially complicate decision-making due to the demands on cognitive integration tasks. We tested female tungara frog, Physalaemus (=Engystomops) pustulosus, responses to male mating signals in noise from multiple sensory modalities (acoustic and visual). Noise treatments were partitioned into three categories: acoustic, visual, and multimodal. We used natural calls from conspecifics and heterospecifics for acoustic noise. Robotic frogs were employed as either visual signal components (synchronous vocal sac inflation with call) or visual noise (asynchronous vocal sac inflation with call). Females expressed a preference for the typically more attractive call in the presence of unimodal noise. However, during multimodal signal and noise treatments (robofrogs employed with background noise), females failed to express a preference for the typically attractive call in the presence of conspecific chorus noise. We found that social context and temporal synchrony of multimodal signaling components are important for multimodal communication. Our results demonstrate that multimodal signals have the potential to increase the complexity of the sensory scene and reduce the efficacy of female decision making. Animal courtship signals are complex. Males of many species advertise their availability as a mate using a complex suite of acoustic, visual, olfactory, or other signals. In tungara frogs, females assess potential mates using both acoustic and visual signals of courting males. In some conditions, the visual cue of a male's inflatable vocal sac can improve the ability of a female to discriminate among different male advertisement calls. When the mating scene becomes noisy, however, a female's ability to choose among the advertisement calls may be compromised. Here we demonstrate how visual and acoustic noise can interfere with female mate choice decisions.",acoustic noise; mate choice; multimodal perception; sexual selection; tungara frog; visual noise,2022,33,5,10.1093/beheco/arac061,1045-2249,14,95,320,2270,6,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Chemical footprints mediate habitat selection in co-occurring aphids,"Habitat selection is a critical process that shapes the spatial distribution of species at local and regional scales. The mechanisms underlying habitat preference rely on environmental factors, species traits, and ecological interactions with other species. Here, we examined spatial segregation between two co-occurring aphid species (Rhopalosiphum maidis and R. padi) on wheat plants. We hypothesized that spatial segregation between these aphid species was mediated by aphid cuticular compounds left as chemical ``footprints{''} on plant surfaces. Combining field and laboratory experiments, we first examined how plant microsites alter fitness by measuring the fecundity of each species. Next, we tested whether intra- and interspecific pre-inhabitation modified habitat selection in both aphid species. Both aphid species preferred and exhibited higher fecundity on wheat stems versus leaves. Laboratory trials showed that R. maidis pre-inhabitation altered R. padi spatial preference. By gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and bioassays testing the effects of aphid density and footprint extracts, we found a density-dependent response, with R. padi avoiding locations previously inhabited by R. maidis. The chemical analysis of footprint crude extracts revealed a highly abundant compound, 1-hexacosanol, and when presented in the synthetic form, also elicited R. padi displacement. Altogether, it indicated that R. maidis footprints altered R. padi habitat selection with cuticular compounds playing a relevant role in the habitat selection process in co-occurring aphid species. Traits like body size, thermal sensitivity, and pheromone production/response can alter a species' habitat preferences with implications for the ways animals compete for limited resources. We used field and laboratory experiments to explore how two aphid species compete for the same host plant microsites. We showed that a cuticular chemical signal deposited by the competitor aphid species contributes to spatial segregation between the co-occurring species.",cuticular compounds; plant microsites; Rhopalosiphum maidis; Rhopalosiphum padi,2022,33,6,10.1093/beheco/arac076,1045-2249,8,68,284,2059,4,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Coordination of care by breeders and helpers in the cooperatively breeding long-tailed tit,"In species with biparental and cooperative brood care, multiple carers cooperate by contributing costly investments to raise a shared brood. However, shared benefits and individual costs also give rise to conflict among carers conflict among carers over investment. Coordination of provisioning visits has been hypothesized to facilitate the resolution of this conflict, preventing exploitation, and ensuring collective investment in the shared brood. We used a 26-year study of long-tailed tits, Aegithalos caudatus, a facultative cooperative breeder, to investigate whether care by parents and helpers is coordinated, whether there are consistent differences in coordination between individuals and reproductive roles, and whether coordination varies with helper relatedness to breeders. Coordination takes the form of turn-taking (alternation) or feeding within a short time interval of another carer (synchrony), and both behaviors were observed to occur more than expected by chance, that is, ``active{''} coordination. First, we found that active alternation decreased with group size, whereas active synchrony occurred at all group sizes. Second, we show that alternation was repeatable between observations at the same nest, whereas synchrony was repeatable between observations of the same individual. Active synchrony varied with reproductive status, with helpers synchronizing visits more than breeders, although active alternation did not vary with reproductive status. Finally, we found no significant effect of relatedness on either alternation or synchrony exhibited by helpers. In conclusion, we demonstrate active coordination of provisioning by carers and conclude that coordination is a socially plastic behavior depending on reproductive status and the number of carers raising the brood. Individuals raising a shared brood prefer other carers to invest more than themselves, resulting in conflict over each carer's investment. We investigated whether this conflict might be mitigated by coordinating visits. We found that long-tailed tits coordinate their care, taking turns to feed chicks and synchronizing arrivals at nests. The degree of coordination varied among individuals and nests, showing that this behavior is socially plastic, consistent with its proposed role in conflict resolution.",alternation; conflict; cooperation; coordination; parental care; synchrony,2022,33,4,10.1093/beheco/arac048,1045-2249,13,90,324,2316,6,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Effects of resource availability on the web structure of female western black widows: is the web structure constrained by physiological trade-offs?,"Finding food often comes at the cost of an increased risk of predation. This could explain why animals often differ in their strategy to obtain food while avoiding predators. We found that spiders did not adjust their web to balance prey capture against predator protection. Instead, changes in web structure caused by variation in the abundance of food that spiders experience are more likely to explain differences among the webs of individual spiders. A major challenge of biological research is to understand what generates and maintains consistent behavioral variation among animals. Time and energy trade-offs, where expressing one behavior is achieved at the expense of another, are often suggested to favor the maintenance of behavioral differences between individuals. However, few studies have investigated how individuals adjust their allocation to different functions over time and depending on resource abundance. Black widow spiders of the genus Latrodectus build persistent webs that include structural threads which protect against predators and sticky trap threads to capture prey. Web structure consistently differs among individuals in the number of trap and structural threads. To quantify the intensity of a trade-off, we assessed the relationship between the number of structural and trap threads and tested whether varying food abundance affected individual differences in web structure. We further quantified how these individual differences change over time and with food abundance. We subjected spiders to three different levels of prey abundance and monitored the structure of their webs every twelve hours. We found no evidence for a trade-off between trap and structural threads. Instead, spiders that produced more structural threads also produced more trap threads, showing that spiders invested equally in both types of threads. Interestingly, the magnitude of individual differences in web structure was greatest when spiders were fed ad libitum and at the beginning of web construction. We suggest that variation in web structure between spiders could be the result of stable developmental differences in morphology or genetic differences.",animal architecture; animal personality; behavioral syndromes; extended phenotype; foraging; individual differences; Latrodectus hesperus,2022,33,6,10.1093/beheco/arac086,1045-2249,21,147,322,2173,7,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Environment and mate attractiveness in a wild insect,"The role of female choice in sexual selection is well established, including the recognition that females choose their mates based on multiple cues. These cues may include intrinsic aspects of a male's phenotype as well as aspects of the environment associated with the male. The role of the spatial location of a potential mate has been well studied in territorial vertebrates. However, despite their role as laboratory models for studies of sexual selection, the potential for insects to choose their mates on the basis of location has scarcely been studied. We studied a natural population of individually tagged crickets (Gryllus campestris) in a meadow in Northern Spain. Adults typically move between burrows every few days, allowing us to examine how pairing success of males can be predicted by the burrow they occupy, independent of their own characteristics. We observed the entirety of ten independent breeding seasons to provide replication and to determine whether the relative importance of these factors is stable across years. We find that both male ID and the ID his burrow affect the likelihood that he is paired with a female, but the burrow has a consistently greater influence. Furthermore, the two factors interact: the relative attractiveness of an individual male depends on which burrow he occupies. Our finding demonstrates a close interaction between naturally and sexually selected traits. It also demonstrates that mate choice studies may benefit from considering not only obvious secondary sexual traits, but also more cryptic traits such as microhabitat choice. We show that female insects choosing to cohabit with a male place more importance on where he lives than on who he is, but the combination of the two is more important still. We know that female birds often choose a male based on the quality of his territory; our 10 years of observing crickets moving around a Spanish meadow to share burrows with members of the opposite sex, reveals insects can do the same.",among year; attractiveness; environment; sexual selection,2022,33,5,10.1093/beheco/arac067,1045-2249,8,52,323,2002,4,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Exposure to elevated temperature during development affects bumblebee foraging behavior,"Climate change is increasingly linked to wild bee loss though the impact on their behavior is poorly documented. Using an experimental approach, we show that elevated developmental temperatures can have drastic effects on bumblebee foraging behavior. Workers developed at elevated temperatures performed fewer foraging trips, potentially because of changes in wing morphology and lower worker production. Ultimately, this may lead to fitness costs for the colony and affect pollination efficiency. Bee foraging behavior provides a pollination service that has both ecological and economic benefits. However, bee population decline could directly affect the efficiency of this interaction. Among the drivers of this decline, global warming has been implicated as an emerging threat but exactly how increasing temperatures affect bee foraging behavior remains unexplored. Here, we assessed how exposure to elevated temperatures during development affects the foraging behavior and morphology of workers from commercial and wild Bombus terrestris colonies. Workers reared at 33 degrees C had a higher visiting rate and shorter visiting time than those reared at 27 degrees C. In addition, far fewer workers reared at 33 degrees C engaged in foraging activities and this is potentially related to the drastic reduction in the number of individuals produced in colonies exposed to 33 degrees C. The impact of elevated developmental temperature on wild colonies was even stronger as none of the workers from these colonies performed any foraging trips. We also found that rearing temperature affected wing size and shape. Our results provide the first evidence that colony temperature can have striking effects on bumblebee foraging behavior. Of particular importance is the drastic reduction in the number of workers performing foraging trips, and the total number of foraging trips made by workers reared in high temperatures. Further studies should explore if, ultimately, these observed effects of exposure to elevated temperature during development lead to a reduction in pollination efficiency.",body size; Bombus terrestris; colony development; foraging behavior; geometric morphometrics; global warming,2022,33,4,10.1093/beheco/arac045,1045-2249,10,87,309,2094,6,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Failed despots and the equitable distribution of fitness in a subsidized species,"It turns out nice jays don't always finish last. While social dominance is typically expected to improve fitness, in areas with abundant human food subsidies, socially subordinate Steller's jays achieve similar fitness as dominant individuals. It is likely that when food is so abundant, dominant jays do not try to exclude subordinates from accessing it. This phenomenon demonstrates that the link between dominance and fitness may be altered in landscapes with abundant human food. Territorial species are often predicted to adhere to an ideal despotic distribution and under-match local food resources, meaning that individuals in high-quality habitat achieve higher fitness than those in low-quality habitat. However, conditions such as high density, territory compression, and frequent territorial disputes in high-quality habitat are expected to cause habitat quality to decline as population density increases and, instead, promote resource matching. We studied a highly human-subsidized and under-matched population of Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) to determine how under-matching is maintained despite high densities, compressed territories, and frequent agonistic behaviors, which should promote resource matching. We examined the distribution of fitness among individuals in high-quality, subsidized habitat, by categorizing jays into dominance classes and characterizing individual consumption of human food, body condition, fecundity, and core area size and spatial distribution. Individuals of all dominance classes consumed similar amounts of human food and had similar body condition and fecundity. However, the most dominant individuals maintained smaller core areas that had greater overlap with subsidized habitat than those of subordinates. Thus, we found that (1) jays attain high densities in subsidized areas because dominant individuals do not exclude subordinates from human food subsidies and (2) jay densities do not reach the level necessary to facilitate resource matching because dominant individuals monopolize space in subsidized areas. Our results suggest that human-modified landscapes may decouple dominance from fitness and that incomplete exclusion of subordinates may be a common mechanism underpinning high densities and creating source populations of synanthropic species in subsidized environments.",Cyanocitta stelleri; density dependence; fitness; habitat selection; human food subsidy; ideal despotic distribution; resource under-matching; Steller's jay,2022,33,5,10.1093/beheco/arac064,1045-2249,12,80,323,2346,8,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,"Female fruit flies copy the acceptance, but not the rejection, of a mate","We studied whether Drosophila females copy the acceptance or the rejection of a courting male or both. We disentangled positive (mating acceptance) and negative (mating rejection) information during the demonstration by showing either a courting male being rejected or copulating with a demonstrator female. Afterwards, the observer female could choose between the same male phenotypes. We found that the copulation is the relevant cue triggering mate copying, while a rejection seems to be unimportant. Acceptance and avoidance can be socially transmitted, especially in the case of mate choice. When a Drosophila melanogaster female observes a conspecific female (called demonstrator female) choosing to mate with one of two males, the former female (called observer female) can memorize and copy the latter female's choice. Traditionally in mate-copying experiments, demonstrations provide two types of information to observer females, namely, the acceptance (positive) of one male and the rejection of the other male (negative). To disentangle the respective roles of positive and negative information in Drosophila mate copying, we performed experiments in which demonstrations provided only one type of information at a time. We found that positive information alone is sufficient to trigger mate copying. Observer females preferred males of phenotype A after watching a female mating with a male of phenotype A in the absence of any other male. Contrastingly, negative information alone (provided by a demonstrator female actively rejecting a male of phenotype B) did not affect future observer females' mate choice. These results suggest that the informative part of demonstrations in Drosophila mate-copying experiments lies mainly, if not exclusively, in the positive information provided by the copulation with a given male. We discuss the reasons for such a result and suggest that Drosophila females learn to prefer the successful males, implying that the underlying learning mechanisms may be shared with those of appetitive memory in non-social associative learning.",Drosophila melanogaster; mate copying; observational learning; social learning,2022,33,5,10.1093/beheco/arac071,1045-2249,13,72,307,2081,4,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Habitat change alters the expression and efficiency of a female ornament,"Anthropogenic habitat changes are disrupting the mate choice process in a range of organisms, with consequences for populations and communities. Research has so far focused on male sexually selected traits and female mate choice, given their conspicuousness, whereas effects on female ornaments and male mate choice have been largely overlooked. Yet, females of many species develop ornaments that males use in mate choice. These ornaments can be costly and reduce female fecundity and viability and, hence, influence population growth rate. Thus, attention should be paid to changes in female ornaments and the consequences the changes have for populations. Here, we show that declining visibility in aquatic ecosystems reduces the investment of female three-spined stickleback in a melanin-based ornament in favor of increased mate search activity. The adjustment appears adaptive as males pay less attention to the ornament under poor visibility, and as melanin-based ornaments are generally physiologically costly. It is likely that past fluctuations in visibility have promoted the evolution of environment-dependent plasticity in female ornamentation. More attention should be paid to changes in female ornaments and their adaptive value, across taxa, given the impact that female investment in ornaments can have on fecundity and population growth rate. Environments are changing at an accelerating rate because of human activities and knowledge of the responses of both males and females is needed to evaluate and predict the ultimate impact on populations and biodiversity. Females often use costly ornaments to attract males. Yet, how these are influenced by human-induced environmental change is unknown, although information on changes in both male and female traits are needed to determine the impact of environmental change on populations. We show that declining visibility reduces the efficiency of a female ornament in the threespine stickleback, and interestingly, that females show adaptive adjustments of the ornament to its reduced efficiency.",environmental change; eutrophication; fecundity; reproduction; sexual selection; signals,2022,33,6,10.1093/beheco/arac080,1045-2249,11,72,302,2063,6,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,Habitat choice versus habitat transformation in a nest-building fish: which matters most?,"Many animals dig nests to provide good conditions for their progeny. Nevertheless, the distinction between the importance of the choice of habitat compared with the characteristics of the modifications made during nest building is little considered. Using the sea lamprey as a study case, it appears that both choice and modification should be considered but that habitat modification had a greater impact on keeping eggs in the nest. Animals of many species lay their eggs in nests built to provide their offspring a suitable microhabitat during a critical phase of development. Nest characteristics result from two processes: habitat choice and modification that may impact differently nest suitability for eggs. This field-based study aimed to estimate their independent effects and their interaction effects on the capacity of sea lamprey nests to retain eggs. Physical variables linked to both habitat choice and habitat modification affected nest suitability, but higher effect sizes indicated the prevalence of habitat modification. The most retentive nests were built in habitats with slower current (habitat choice) and had steeper slope between the deepest part of the nest (pit) and the downstream mound (habitat modification); the positive effect of the steep slope increasing with flow velocity in the nest. Our results show that habitat choice and habitat modification must be taken into account in evolutionary or conservation studies that analyze nest-building animals.",conservation; egg retention; evolution; habitat modification; nest; sea lamprey,2022,33,3,10.1093/beheco/arac029,1045-2249,12,89,223,1485,6,14,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Food-caching chickadees do not exhibit directional bias when learning a spatial task,"Animals frequently encounter situations in which they can choose to move either left or right. Consistent preferences to move a specific direction may be associated with lateralization, or the asymmetric structure and function of the brain and nervous system. Other lateralized behaviors commonly occur across taxa, possibly reflecting a selective advantage of cerebral specialization. Yet, lateralization and possible directional biases are rarely tested within an ecologically relevant context, such as movement, or while animals are making decisions on a larger scale. Here, we quantify to what extent wild food-caching mountain chickadees (Poecile gambeli) in their natural environment demonstrate consistent directional biases in movement when learning a spatial task. Directional bias was estimated from the direction (left or right) that birds moved around a square experimental apparatus while searching for a food reward at the beginning of the tasks, at which point birds had not yet fully learned the location of the food reward. Chickadees did not show a directional bias in movement at a population level. Individual variation in directional bias was significantly repeatable across years but did not significantly vary between two elevations and was not significantly associated with performance on either a spatial learning and memory task or a single spatial reversal learning task. Overall, our results show that chickadees did not show directional bias when deciding what direction to move during spatial cognitive tasks, suggesting that no consistent preference in movement direction may be advantageous when searching for food on a larger scale. Significance statement Many animals across a wide range of taxa will consistently prefer to use either their left or right side to complete certain types of tasks. Such asymmetric behaviors may be associated with asymmetries in brain structure and are well documented in birds. Yet, mountain chickadees did not show similar directional biases in their movement-based decision-making. Furthermore, biases in their movement were not associated with overall cognitive performance. These null results suggest that while strong left or right preferences may be beneficial in certain contexts, such biases might not be advantageous while foraging for food on a larger scale.",Spatial cognition; Lateralization; Directional bias; Foraging; Food-caching; Chickadee,2023,77,1,10.1007/s00265-022-03275-6,0340-5443,12,84,346,2334,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Of mice and cats: interspecific variation in prey responses to direct and indirect predator cues,"Prey behavioral responses to predation risk cues may vary between species; moreover, the strength of these behaviors may differ depending on risk cue. In northwestern Taiwan, we used the giving up density (GUD) framework supported with camera trap observations to test how two wild murid rodents that differ by up to fivefold in body size (striped field mouse, Apodemus agrarius, and lesser rice-field rat, Rattus losea) altered their foraging behavior depending on microhabitat characteristics (indirect predator cues) and exposure to predator odors (direct predator cues) of three felids: the native leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), the introduced domestic cat (Felis catus), and the exotic bobcat (Lynx rufus). GUD was not affected by predator odors but rather by microhabitat type; rodents removed more seeds under the cover of vegetation compared to exposed food stations, which may reflect a proactive approach to avoiding high-risk areas in a heterogeneous environment. The smaller mouse, A. agrarius, spent more time foraging in experimental food patches compared to the larger rat, R. losea, irrespective of predator odor. Conversely, R. losea spent more time investigating stations and exhibiting vigilance compared to A. agrarius. Species-level differences are consistent with behavioral phenomenon that smaller, ``faster `` species confer more boldness compared to larger, ``slower `` species, which reinforces the connection between behavior and pace of life, and further elucidates how the behavior of different prey species may not be interchangeable in contexts of risk. Significance statement In the wild, animals eat while trying not to be eaten. Therefore, preys often change their behavior in response to risk cues, but the intricacies of these behavioral shifts can be complex and vary between species. With the use of camera trap monitoring and experimental food patches, we were able to examine fine-scale species-specific behaviors and test for dissimilarities. Two species of wild rodents did not change their foraging behavior to the addition of predator odors, but we did observe an interspecific behavioral variation. The smaller, ``faster `` rodent species spent more time foraging, while the larger, ``slower `` species spent more time vigilant with more thorough investigation. These interspecific behavioral differences likely indicate the smaller species demonstrated more boldness, whereas the larger rodent was more cautious, which is consistent with the association between pace of life (POL) and behavior.",Behaviors; Giving up density (GUD); Vigilance; Foraging; Microhabitat; Predation risk,2023,77,1,10.1007/s00265-022-03277-4,0340-5443,15,96,376,2549,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Begging is an honest signal of hunger in a communally nesting bird with low genetic relatedness,"Kin selection theory predicts that conflict over resource allocation will intensify as relatedness between dependent young and adult caregivers decreases. As inclusive fitness constraints on dishonest signalling relax, begging behaviour is less likely to be a reliable indicator of hunger or condition. Therefore, dishonest signalling is expected to be especially prevalent in communally breeding species, for which offspring survival often depends on care from both related and unrelated adults. We evaluated the scope for conflict and its consequences for dishonest signalling in the greater ani (Crotophaga major), a communally nesting cuckoo in which multiple unrelated pairs lay in the same nest. Using video recordings of nearly 2500 feeding events across 10 nests, we demonstrate that begging behaviour is a reliable signal of hunger, with hungrier nestlings begging more intensely. We also show that begging may communicate reliable information about condition in the long term, with smaller nestlings begging more intensely than their larger broodmates. Ultimately, larger nestlings and those who begged more intensely were more likely to receive food, indicating that both begging signals and scramble competition influence resource allocation. Together, our results indicate that honest begging signals can persist even when caregivers and young are unrelated. Significance statement Offspring solicit food from their adult caregivers through a variety of begging behaviours. These behaviours can convey important information about offspring hunger and/or long-term condition, but may be exaggerated, if offspring attempt to gain more than their proportionate share of resources. We examined whether offspring exaggerate their begging behaviour, such that it is not a reliable indicator of their hunger or condition, in the greater ani. Greater anis breed communally, with multiple pairs sharing a single nest simultaneously such that nestlings are fed by both their parents and unrelated adult caregivers. Theory predicts that begging should be less reliable if offspring and caregivers are unrelated, but we found that greater ani begging behaviour reliably communicated hunger, and potentially long-term condition, to adults. This study is the first to evaluate begging signal reliability in a communally breeding species.",Communal breeding; Crotophaga major; Greater ani; Honest signalling; Inclusive fitness; Parent-offspring conflict,2022,76,11,10.1007/s00265-022-03252-z,0340-5443,16,95,336,2336,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"Characteristics of breeding habitat, genetic mating system, and determinants of male mating success in the sponge-dwelling goby Elacatinus lori","Determining the patterns and causes of variation in reproductive success is key to understanding mating systems and sexual selection, but they are challenging to study in cryptobenthic coral reef fishes. Here, we investigate characteristics of breeding habitat, the genetic mating system, and correlates of male mating success in the neon goby Elacatinus lori. This fish is primarily found living and breeding within the yellow tube sponge Aplysina fistularis in Belize - it has become a focus of marine population ecology research, but knowledge of its behavioral ecology is lacking. First, we show that sponges occupied by breeding males tend to be larger than those occupied by residents. Second, we show that E. lori males exhibit a polygynous mating system: some males breed with multiple females simultaneously and/or sequentially. Third, we show that male size is positively related to multiple metrics of male mating success: number of days paired with females, number of clutches laid, and total reproductive output. Male size, however, explains only a small proportion of the variation in male mating success, suggesting that other aspects of the males' phenotype and ecological context need to be quantified to better explain variation in mating success. More generally, our results suggest that when female movements are restricted, it is necessary to measure habitat characteristics and male traits at smaller spatial scales to gain a deeper understanding of their effects on mating systems and sexual selection. Significance statement Measuring male reproductive success in a wild population is notoriously difficult, particularly in cryptobenthic coral reef fishes. Often, mating success is used as a proxy for reproductive success because it is easier to measure. Variation in mating success is often predicted by characteristics of the individual and its breeding habitat. Here, we simultaneously describe the (i) breeding habitat, (ii) genetic mating system, and (iii) relationship between male traits, habitat characteristics, and mating success in the neon goby Elacatinus lori. By investigating these three elements together, we provide solid foundations for understanding this species' mating system. More generally, we suggest that investigations of variation in mating success may be improved by approaching analyses at smaller, more biologically relevant, spatial scales.

BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Chestnut caching behavior of Chinese white-bellied rats (Niviventer confucianus) and South China field mice (Apodemus draco): effects of seed size and insect infestation,"Understanding rodent seed caching behavior is critical for effective forest management and conservation. While it is well established that rodent feeding behavior is strongly affected by seed traits and insect infestation of seeds, there is still a knowledge gap on how these factors affect rodent feeding behavior. Here we conducted a series of experiments to investigate the feeding and hoarding preferences of two sympatric rodent species, the Chinese white-bellied rat (Niviventer confucianus) and South China field mouse (Apodemus draco) in response to Chinese chestnuts (Castanea mollissima) of contrasting seed size and insect infestation. When only sound nuts (not infested nuts) were provided, both species preferentially consumed larger nuts, esp. the larger N. confucianus showed more pronounced selective preference for larger nuts than the smaller A. draco. When sound and insect-infested nuts of equal size were provided, neither species selected for sound over insect-infested nuts, but infested seeds were more frequently consumed in situ. If nuts of differing size and infestation status were provided, rodents preferred to eat and hoard larger seeds regardless of insect infestation. Overall, however, infested seeds were more often consumed immediately in situ while sound seeds were more often consumed ex situ or cached. Our results thus support the seed size hypothesis, but show little evidence for the insect infestation hypothesis, and highlight that food preferences and optimal foraging decisions differ between sympatric rodent species. Significance statement Rodent caching and feeding behaviors are strongly affected by co-varying seed traits such as size and insect infestation, which in turn regulate seed survival and seedling recruitment. By using semi-natural enclosures, we detected differences in feeding and hoarding behaviors between sympatric rodent species, and their different preferences for seed size and insect infestation. These different preferences may support the seed size hypothesis. Rodents based their foraging decision predominantly on seed size and not insect infestation, preferring to eat and hoard larger seeds regardless of their insect infestation. We suggest that the differences in feeding and hoarding behaviors of sympatric rodent species in relation to seed size and insect infestation should be considered in future field studies, as this will help us to better understand mechanisms that impact forest management and conservation.",Optimal foraging; Seed caching; Hoarding behavior; Insect infestation; Seed size; Castanea mollissima,2022,76,10,10.1007/s00265-022-03247-w,0340-5443,23,169,361,2497,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Differences in daily singing routines reflect male condition along a montane gradient,"Vocal communication is used across taxa to convey a range of information. One of the most well-studied vocal behaviors is the song of temperate passerine birds. Among individuals, male song differs across numerous acoustic parameters, many of which are used by females to assess male quality. Males in better condition often produce higher song output and start singing earlier in the day compared to other males. However, the energetic cost of singing varies throughout the day and may be affected by the singer's foraging abilities. Along an elevation gradient, harsher environmental conditions at higher elevations shape foraging abilities in mountain chickadees (Poecile gambeli), which are non-migratory food hoarders. High-elevation mountain chickadees exhibit superior spatial cognitive abilities and a higher propensity to cache food, which enables them to forage more efficiently, compared to lower elevation birds. High-elevation males may therefore be able to produce higher song output, especially earlier in the day, than low-elevation males. We compared the daily singing routines of male mountain chickadees inhabiting high and low elevations. We found no difference in total daily song output between elevations; however, high-elevation males sang significantly more than low-elevation males at dawn, when singing is both crucial for reproductive opportunities and most costly due to overnight fasting. Song output at dawn may therefore act as an indicator of condition in male mountain chickadees. Significance statement Animals communicate across modalities to exchange information about foraging, predators, and movements. Researchers have studied the vocalizations of songbirds to understand how individual variation affects the behavior of receives, particularly regarding male song and female mating preferences. The song of many songbirds is learned locally and contains information about the location of origin and respective selective pressures. We tested whether natural access to food via food cache recovery was associated with daily singing routines in food-caching birds. Singing at dawn is thought to be costly as it follows overnight fasting. We found that birds from harsher environments-where selection for enhanced spatial cognitive abilities required for cache retrieval is much stronger-sing more at dawn compared to males from milder environments, where selection on spatial cognition is relaxed. This work shows that environmental selection pressures affect signal production in male songbirds, which may provide information to females during mate choice.",Song output; Male condition; Food availability; Elevation gradient; Mountain chickadee,2022,76,10,10.1007/s00265-022-03246-x,0340-5443,12,85,372,2594,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Domed nests as an exaptation for compound nest construction: the case of the common waxbill,"Nests are essential for breeding in many birds, and differ widely in morphology across species. Only a few bird species build compound nests, with different nest chambers as part of a continuous structure. Knowing the ecological and social conditions leading to compound nest construction in species where this behaviour is not the norm can improve our understanding of their functions and evolution. We studied how limited space availability affected nest building behaviour in a population of wild-caught common waxbills (Estrilda astrild), across 4 years, in a mesocosm with abundant vegetation (e.g. grass, brambles, bushes). In addition to their typical isolated domed nests, built mostly on or near ground level, we found that 141 out of a total of 423 nest chambers were in compound structures, each comprising 2 to 11 nest chambers, and that most compound nests were above the ground on bushes. Compound nests were never reported for common waxbills in nature, and we thus conclude that compound nest construction is a plastic response caused by the high density of this population relative to available nesting sites in the mesocosm. Since the morphology of domed nests resembles that of nest chambers in compound structures, domed nests may be an exaptation for high-density nesting and may facilitate the evolution of more specialised compound nest construction. Significance statement Avian nests differ across species with, for example, some species building cup-shaped nests and others domed nests with an entrance. A small number of bird species typically build compound nests with multiple entrances connected to different domed chambers. Compound nests can be associated with complex social structures, but it is little understood what may be the initial steps in the evolutionary origin of this behaviour. We show that the common waxbill, a species described as building independent domed nests in nature, can build compound nests under reduced availability of suitable nesting space, whose chambers are used by either the same pair or different pairs. Such plastic building of compound nests, in response to environmental constraints, could then facilitate the evolution of more specialised compound nests.",Behavioural plasticity; Enclosed nests; Estrilda astrild; Nest building; Spatial distribution,2022,76,12,10.1007/s00265-022-03264-9,0340-5443,15,91,342,2225,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Effects of early-life experience on innovation and problem-solving in captive coyotes,"Early-life experience often shapes behaviors like innovation and exploration. These behaviors are important to animals encountering novel food resources in diverse habitats, such as mesocarnivores in urban areas. To understand if early-life experiences impact later-life behavior, we examined how coyotes (Canis latrans) responded to a multi-access puzzle box at two life stages: pup (similar to 7 weeks) and dispersal (similar to 10 months). We first exposed pups, still living with their parents and littermates, to a baited puzzle box. At dispersal age, we again tested both these pups and an age-matched control group that was not exposed to the puzzle box as pups, both as individuals and with their pair-mate. We quantified problem-solving capability, latency to approach, and time spent in proximity to the puzzle box. Most pup litters solved two of the three access points, but no dispersal-age coyotes solved any access point. The amount of time dispersal-age coyotes spent near the box during pair-testing increased with (1) more time spent near the box during single-testing, (2) more time their pair-mate spent near the box during pair-testing, and (3) if their pair-mate came from a litter that previously solved the box. These results suggest that early-life experience and social interactions influence exploratory behavior at dispersal age, but coyotes exhibit increased avoidance behavior at this life stage, which corresponds with the life stage that overall survivorship decreases. Our study provides insight into how early-life experiences shape adult behavior in mesocarnivores. Significance statement Exploratory behaviors, including risk-taking and problem-solving, are likely important characteristics for urban-dwelling species, such as coyotes, but how development and sociality influence these traits is poorly understood. Therefore, we presented coyotes with a puzzle box as pups with their littermates and again at dispersal age, both individually and with their pair-mate. Three of four litters solved the puzzle box when housed with their littermates, but no coyotes solved at dispersal age when housed alone or with their pair-mate. Notably, there was a general decrease in exploratory behavior and innovation from pup to dispersal age. However, we found that previous experiences during puzzle-box trials positively influenced the amount of time coyote pairs spent near the puzzle box at dispersal age. Our results suggest that pursuing food resources in novel situations may be constrained by developmental processes, possibly in response to prioritizing future opportunities to reproduce.",Ontogeny; Development; Life stages; Social learning; Facilitation,2022,76,10,10.1007/s00265-022-03251-0,0340-5443,11,85,386,2623,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"Evolutionary implications of size-selective mortality on the ontogenetic development of shoal cohesion: a neurochemical approach using a zebrafish, Danio rerio, harvest selection experiment","Size-selective mortality may evolutionarily alter life-history as well as individual behavioral and physiological traits. Moreover, size-selective mortality can affect group behavioral traits, such as shoaling and collective properties (e.g., shoal cohesion), which are relevant for finding food and reducing risk of predation. Here, we present experimental evidence using selection lines of zebrafish (Danio rerio) that were exposed to positive ( large-harvested), negative (small-harvested), and random (control) size-selective mortality for five generations, followed by eight generations during which harvesting was halted to remove maternal effects and to study evolutionarily fixed outcomes. We investigated changes in shoal cohesion and turnover in monoamines in zebrafish through ontogeny. To that end, we repeatedly measured inter-individual distance in groups of eight fish and the turnovers of dopamine and serotonin in brains of fish from juvenile to the adult stage at 40-day intervals. We, firstly, found that shoal cohesion was overall consistent through ontogeny at group levels suggesting the presence of collective personality. Secondly, we found a decrease in shoal cohesion through ontogeny in the small-harvested and control lines, while the large-harvested line did not show any ontogenetic change. Thirdly, the selection lines did not differ among each other in shoal cohesion at any ontogenetic stage. Fourthly, dopamine turnover increased through ontogeny in a similar way for all lines while the serotonin turnover decreased in the large-harvested and control lines, but not in the small-harvested line. The large-harvested line also had higher serotonin turnover than controls at specific time periods. In conclusion, intensive size-selective mortality left an evolutionary legacy of asymmetric selection responses in the ontogeny of shoal cohesion and the underlying physiological mechanisms in experimentally harvested zebrafish in the laboratory. Significant statement The evolution of animal behavior can be affected by human activities both at behavioral and physiological levels, but causal evidence is scarce and mostly focusing on single life-stages. We studied whether and to what extent size-selective harvesting, a common selection pattern in fisheries, can be an evolutionary driver of the development of shoal cohesion during ontogeny. We used a multi-generation experiment with zebrafish to study cause-and-effects of opposing size-selection patterns. We quantified shoal cohesion, and serotonin and dopamine turnover in the brain. We found that shoal cohesion emerged as a collective personality trait and that behavioral and physiological responses were asymmetrical with respect to the opposing selection patterns.",Fisheries-induced evolution; Shoaling; Collective personality; Dopamine; Serotonin; Zebrafish,2022,76,12,10.1007/s00265-022-03258-7,0340-5443,23,189,385,2758,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Impact of predator model presentation paradigms on titi monkey alarm sequences,"Predator presentation experiments are widely used to investigate animal alarm vocalizations. They usually involve presentations of predator models or playbacks of predator calls, but it remains unclear whether the two paradigms provide similar results, a major limitation when investigating animal syntactic and semantic capacities. Here, we investigate whether visual and acoustic predator cues elicit different vocal reactions in black-fronted titi monkeys (Callicebus nigrifrons). We exposed six groups of wild titi monkeys to visual models or playbacks of vocalizations of raptor or felid. We characterized each group's vocal reactions using sequence parameters known to reliably encode predatory events in this species. We found that titi monkeys' vocal reactions varied with the predator species but also with the experimental paradigm: while vocal reactions to raptor vocalizations and models were similar, felid vocalizations elicited heterogeneous, different reactions from that given to felid models. We argue that subjects are not familiar with felid vocalizations, because of a lack of learning opportunities due to the silent behaviour of felids. We discuss the implication of these findings for the semantic capacities of titi monkeys. We finally recommend that playbacks of predator vocalizations should not be used in isolation but in combination with visual model presentations, to allow fine-grained analyses of the communication system of prey species. Significance statement It is common to present prey species with predator models or predator calls to study their vocal reactions. The two paradigms are often used independently, but it remains unclear whether they provide similar results. Here, we studied the vocal reactions of titi monkeys to calls and models of raptors and felids. We show that titi monkeys seem to recognize the vocalizations of raptors but not those of felids. The study of the vocal reactions emitted when titi monkeys cannot clearly identify the threat allows us to draw accurate hypotheses about the meaning of titi monkeys' alarm utterances. We argue that playbacks of predator calls should be used in conjunction with model presentations, which can allow us to better investigate the information and the structure of the alarm systems.",Callicebus nigrifrons; Model presentation; Playback experiment; Semantics; Syntax; Vocal reaction,2022,76,11,10.1007/s00265-022-03250-1,0340-5443,11,78,340,2285,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Individual and collective behaviour of fish subject to differing risk-level treatments with a sympatric predator,"The ability to adapt behaviour according to context is vital to the success of many organisms, particularly when it comes to mitigating risk, across time and space, in unpredictable environments. While many studies have examined the role of predation threat in shaping behaviour, very few have quantitatively investigated prey responses across different elements of perceived risk or ecological contexts. Here, we present a detailed analysis of how mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) adapt their individual and collective behaviour in five experimental treatments designed to replicate different core elements of predator threat. As risk increased, within and across treatments, fish decreased movements across key regions of their environment, swimming speed and nearest neighbour distances, reflecting a threat-sensitive approach. Furthermore, movement predictability also decreased when fish occupied higher risk areas. Within and between treatments, increased risk shaped the local interactions among fish. Local density, group polarisation, and alignment of near neighbours increased, while patterns of local density differed according to whether the fish were in a preferred (region of low perceived risk) or non-preferred (region of high perceived risk) area. Groups in non-preferred areas became elongated, suggesting more rapid locomotion. The rate of turning response and changes in speed relative to the positions of near neighbours increased as a function of risk in safer areas but became less coordinated in areas and treatments associated with higher risk. Importantly, the interactions between fish under the greatest risk also showed a novel qualitative shift in patterns, with fish prioritising group cohesion over group order. Taken together, these results demonstrate the considerable flexibility of fish to adapt according to risk, producing both quantitative and qualitative changes in behaviour as a function of proximate threat levels.",Predator-prey; Threat; Behavioural flexibility; Shoaling; Collective movement,2022,76,12,10.1007/s00265-022-03269-4,0340-5443,15,112,278,1958,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Long-term effects of sex-specific sibling interaction on the development of blue-footed boobies,"The sex of an animal's siblings can potentially have long-term effects on its development if it competes or cooperates with them in a brood or litter. For the first test of lifelong developmental effects of infant siblings' sex in a wild animal, we monitored broods of two blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) chicks that recruited intact into their natal breeding population. Female chicks grow to be 27\% heavier than male chicks and broodmates compete aggressively for food during 10 weeks. We took hatch order into account because first-hatched chicks aggressively dominate their siblings and sometimes kill them, and second-hatched chicks experience chronic stress. We confirmed only one of 20 predictions for long-term effects of sibling sex: females with elder brothers had lower odds of hatching their eggs than females with elder sisters. However, sex of their elder sibling made no difference to a female's or male's age of first reproduction, annual survival, fledging success, age of last sighting, or accumulated breeding success. Based on 760 recruits from 18 birth cohorts, these findings suggest that, although a sibling's sex could, for all we know, affect an individual's survival in the nestling or juvenile stages, long-term effects on survival and reproductive performance in the adult stage are mostly absent or inconsequential in two-chick broods that recruit intact. This resilience is likely due to evolved developmental buffering of adult survival and reproductive performance, but impacts of a sibling's sex on development and survival during the nestling and juvenile periods remain to be tested. Significance statement The development of many animal infants is influenced by interacting with siblings, and in many birds the growth and behavior of female and male chicks differ during the development of a brood. It is therefore likely that female and male siblings shape a chick's development differently, but no test of long-term developmental effects of siblings' sex has been made in any bird. In a species where female chicks are bigger than male chicks, sibs compete aggressively for months, and sibling dominance relationships are universal, we tested for developmental impacts of the sibling's sex in broods of two chicks that both recruited into the breeding population. We monitored 760 chicks from 18 cohorts over their lifetimes, up to age 23 years. Long-term effects of the sibling's sex on the survival, reproduction, and fitness of females and males were absent or inconsequential.",Sex-specific sibling effects; Lifelong developmental influence,2022,76,11,10.1007/s00265-022-03248-9,0340-5443,12,95,391,2521,2,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"Maternity colony social structure of myotis in British Columbia, Canada","Female myotis bats may select artificial structures, such as bat boxes and buildings, to form their maternity colonies, and may form preferential associations with other bats based on age or reproductive status. We studied two colonies of little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) and Yuma bats (M. yumanesis) in artificial structures near Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to assess changes in social organization based on reproductive period. During summer 2019, we used Passive Integrated Technology (PIT-tags and scanners) to track individuals' daily roost selection and social organization, then used social network analysis to compare temporal networks representing critical reproductive periods. Yuma myotis and little brown myotis formed strong, close associations with other bats during pregnancy and lactation but colony organization fragmented during post-lactation as adult and juveniles began roosting independently. Bats segregated by species during post-lactation, whereas they had previously roosted with heterospecifics during pregnancy and lactation. Little brown myotis left the maternity site in August, while Yuma myotis persisted until September and mixed with conspecifics from nearby maternity colonies in a previously unoccupied roost. Our results show that myotis maternity colony organization is not static and reflects myriad temporal, reproductive, and species-specific influences. Significance statement Bats often form associations with other bats, thus driving colony organization and roost use. We studied the social structure of two maternity colonies in the lower mainland of British Columbia, Canada. The colonies contained little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) and Yuma myotis (M. yumanensis), which roosted in buildings and bat boxes that enabled larger maternity colonies than may occur in wild habitats. We compared social networks of PIT-tagged adult female bats during critical reproductive periods to monitor how bat behavior changed. Bats formed strong associations with colony members during pregnancy and lactation with very little ingress or egress of individuals from the colony. During post-lactation, however, overall colony organization weakened as bats moved to other roosts and many new bats began roosting with the colony. Little brown myotis left maternity sites first while Yuma myotis mixed with other conspecifics from nearby maternity colonies. Thus, colony organization in little brown myotis and Yuma myotis is not static and bats observed during post-lactation are often not the same animals observed earlier in the summer Additionally, post-lactation mixing between Yuma myotis from different colonies suggests that artificial roosts may provide valuable habitat after the young are volant. Our results show that social organization at maternity colonies is a dynamic reflection of reproductive and species-specific influences.",Bats; Social network analysis; Myotis; Maternity colonies; Artificial roosts,2022,76,12,10.1007/s00265-022-03265-8,0340-5443,10,71,406,2891,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"Multiple parasitism in an evictor brood parasite: patterns revealed by long-term monitoring, continuous video recording, and genetic analyses","In some populations of the host of brood parasites, more than two parasite eggs may be laid in a single nest. This phenomenon is known as multiple parasitism, representing a cost to both the host and parasite. In this study, we analysed a long-term dataset (2007-2021) focusing on multiple parasitism of the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) parasitizing the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). The annual parasitism rate was on average 54.3\% and varied between 5.8\% and 92.2\%, depending on the year. Out of 720 parasitized nests, double parasitism was recorded in 172 (23.9\%) nests, triple in 51 (7.1\%) nests, quadruple in 10 (1.3\%) nests, and, exceptionally, in the years of heavy parasitism (about 90\%), quintuple parasitism was recorded in three (0.4\%) nests. The rate of multiple parasitism ranged from 0 to 63\% inter-annually and strongly correlated with the parasitism rate and the total number of parasite eggs found. Furthermore, the number of cuckoo eggs laid per one nest increased with the decreasing daily availability of host nests that were at a suitable breeding stage for parasitism. Both genetic and egg phenotype analyses revealed that no cuckoo female laid more than one egg in the same host nest. Using data on long-term parasite-host interactions and from continuous video recording, as well as progressive methods to assign parasite offspring thus helped us better understand various aspects of multiple parasitism in hosts heavily parasitized by an evictor brood parasite. Significance statement Laying more parasite eggs in one host nest (i.e. multiple parasitism) is common in brood parasites whose nestlings share the nest with nestmates. In the species where the parasite's nestling kills its nest mates, multiple parasitism should be rare because it is costly for the parasite. However, in host populations with high parasitism rates, multiple parasitism occurs more often than predicted. Using long-term and video-recording data, we quantified multiple parasitism in the common cuckoo across years and host egg-laying sequences. We found that the rate of multiple parasitism is positively related to the parasitism rate and that the lower the number of nests suitable for parasitism, the higher the number of parasite eggs in one nest. Based on genetic and egg phenotype analyses, we also showed that individual parasitic females avoid laying in the nests they had already parasitized.",Brood parasitism; Common cuckoo; Coevolution; Egg phenotype; Great reed warbler,2022,76,12,10.1007/s00265-022-03270-x,0340-5443,18,141,377,2434,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Neither paternity loss nor perceived threat of cuckoldry affects male nestling provisioning in grass wrens,"Extra-pair paternity (EPP) is frequent in socially monogamous birds with biparental care. However, males should avoid providing care to unrelated offspring. In this study, we first analyzed the relationship between parental care and paternity loss, and secondly, we evaluated if males adjust parental care to a perceived threat of cuckoldry. Over three breeding seasons, we intensively studied a color-banded population of south temperate grass wrens Cistothorus platensis. We monitored nests attended by socially monogamous males, collected blood samples from adults and nestlings, and recorded male provisioning rates to the nestlings. Paternity was assigned genetically using SNP markers. We simulated territorial intrusions during the female fertile period (egg-laying) to manipulate males' perceived threat of cuckoldry. Neither the proportion of extra-pair offspring nor the presence/absence of extra-pair offspring in the nest affected male provisioning rates, suggesting that males did not adjust parental effort to actual paternity loss. Simulated territorial intrusions revealed that males were more likely to approach and attack a conspecific than a heterospecific stuffed decoy. However, experimental and control males provided food to their nestlings at similar rates. Retaliatory reduction of paternal care might not have evolved in grass wrens given the low frequency of extra-pair paternity (23\%). Alternatively, males may rely predominately on precopulatory strategies (e.g., territoriality and mate guarding) to prevent females from obtaining extra-pair fertilizations. Significance statement A central tenet in the study of extra-pair behavior in birds is that males should reduce their parental contribution when females engage in extra-pair copulations. Males are thought to use indirect clues (female absences, male intrusions) and direct clues (observation of copulations) to gauge paternity loss. We studied the relationship between extra-pair behavior and male contribution to feeding nestlings in a Neotropical population of grass wrens. We found that males did not adjust their contribution to paternal care based on actual paternity loss. Moreover, simulated male intrusions during the female fertile period, which influence a male's perceived threat of cuckoldry, did not affect paternal care. Our results suggest that male grass wrens do not indirectly retaliate against females who engage in extra-pair behavior by reducing parental care.",Cistothorus platensis; Extra-pair paternity; Neotropic; Paternal care,2022,76,11,10.1007/s00265-022-03253-y,0340-5443,15,106,347,2470,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Patch choice decisions by a fission-fusion forager as a test of the ecological constraints model,"Chapman et al.'s (Behav Ecol Sociobiol 36:59-70, 1995) ecological constraints model posits that the size and distribution of food patches place restrictions upon foraging group size. Larger groups incur increased travel costs for any given array of patches, and thus, to fulfil individual energetic and nutritional requirements, foragers should adjust group sizes to balance energy obtained against that spent on travelling. Support for this model comes from both comparative and species-specific studies but findings are contradictory, and the utility of the model has been questioned. This study provides a rigorous test, analysing measurements from distinct food patches and individual inter-patch movements, on an appropriately shorter temporal scale. Using data drawn from two social groups of a species characterised by a high degree of fission-fusion dynamics, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), we show that larger parties foraged in larger food patches and for longer durations, and that larger parties were associated with further travel between patches. Overt contest competition over food increased with party size. We found no evidence of distinct sex differences in either party size or travel distances: the predictive power of forager sex was low compared to that of ecological variables. We propose that analysis at the patch level is more appropriate than a daily averaging approach that may smooth out the very variation being investigated. Our findings suggest that, despite certain limitations, Chapman et al.'s (Behav Ecol Sociobiol 36:59-70, 1995) model of ecological constraints remains a useful tool. Ecology does indeed constrain grouping patterns, and the impact of this is not necessarily differentiated by sex. Significance statement Foraging animals face the `more mouths to feed' problem: as the numbers in a group increase, the group must travel further to find enough food, using up energy. Hence, foragers should adjust numbers to minimise these costs, but tests of this idea have proved inconclusive. We investigated the foraging behaviour of chimpanzees, a species with highly flexible grouping, considering their travel between specific patches of food. We found clear support for this proposition, with larger patches of food hosting larger numbers of foragers, and such groups having to travel further to find food. Although it is often thought that female animals should respond more strongly to foraging costs, we found little evidence of sex differences. Our results show that ecology does indeed constrain grouping patterns, and that the impact is felt equally by males and females.",Foraging; Patch size; Travel distance; Party size; Pan troglodytes; Chimpanzee,2022,76,12,10.1007/s00265-022-03262-x,0340-5443,15,96,395,2624,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Phenotypic correlates of pelvic spine coloration in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus): implications for function and evolution,"Animal color patches may be static or plastic in expression and concealable or continuously visible, yet the evolution and function of these aspects of coloration have seldom been studied together. We investigated such color pattern elements using the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Despite a rich history of study of stickleback nuptial color pattern evolution, disagreement persists regarding selection pressures and function and only limited research has addressed the role of pelvic spine coloration, a potentially important, and substantially concealable, color pattern element. We investigated (i) whether male pelvic spine (along with throat and body) coloration is relatively static or plastic across the reproductive cycle, (ii) when pelvic spines are raised versus concealed across behavioral contexts, and (iii) associations between color patches and behavior in males. We found no significant variation in spine color across reproductive stages whereas body color was more plastic and intensely red during courtship and egg/fry care. Conspicuousness of pelvic spine coloration instead varied behaviorally, through increased erection frequency during social interactions and in response to a model predator. Spine erection frequency was positively associated with behaviors that enhance spine color visibility, i.e., flees and leads to nest. These findings suggest that stickleback use pelvic spines to display an intensely red color patch facultatively, either as a complement to similar body coloration or possibly as a substitute. Significance statement The interplay between color patches that are either readily concealable or always visible has been little studied, particularly in organisms with patches on a single individual that differ in capacity for concealment, such as the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). While much work has been done on the evolution of coloration in stickleback, little has addressed patterns of expression and evolutionary functions of pelvic spine color, which can be facultatively concealed. We evaluated the expression characteristics of male spine coloration within the spawning period and how spine color relates to other color patches. Our work also examines the relationship between pelvic spine erections and presentation of spine color patches and raises the possibility of pelvic spine color being naturally selected and functioning across different behavioral contexts.",Gasterosteus aculeatus; Threespine stickleback; Animal coloration; Pelvic spine; Animal behavior; Evolution,2022,76,11,10.1007/s00265-022-03256-9,0340-5443,17,144,347,2460,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Sex-specific effects of capital resources on reproductive timing and success in red squirrels,"Reproduction is an energetically expensive activity for both sexes. However, if males and females differ in their annual timing of reproduction, such that peak investment for one sex occurs during a more resource-limited period, there is an opportunity for sex-specific selection to act on the acquisition of energetic resources. Both male and female North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) cache conifer cones, although males typically have larger caches than females. Peak energetic investment in reproduction occurs for males during the mating season in winter and early spring (when squirrels rely almost exclusively on cached resources) and for females during lactation (which can align with fresh food availability). We provide evidence that suggests sex differences in cache size are likely driven by a stronger positive connection between cached resources and components of fitness for males than for females. Specifically, males with larger caches have greater siring success than males with smaller caches, whereas for females, only early breeding females experience a positive effect of cache size on the number of recruits produced. We also show that males sire pups and females give birth earlier in the year if they have larger caches compared with squirrels of the same sex with smaller caches. Sexual selection can thus extend beyond traits directly connected to mating behavior, and can act on traits related to acquiring resources needed to fuel reproduction that are expressed months or years in advance of breeding efforts. Significance statement The timing and energetic requirements of reproduction are often different for males and females which could drive different life history strategies between the sexes. Red squirrels in the southwest Yukon, Canada cache white spruce cones in autumn, which serve as their primary food source until fresh food becomes available during summer. We measured the size of squirrel caches and subsequently monitored their reproduction to test whether the influence of stored food differs for males and females. We confirmed that males have larger caches than females and show that this is likely driven by a stronger positive association of cache size and components of fitness for males than for females. These findings highlight that the strength of selection can differ on the homologous traits of males and females leading to sex-specific extended phenotypes.",Caching; Capital breeding; Fitness; Life history; Phenology; Sexual selection,2022,76,10,10.1007/s00265-022-03245-y,0340-5443,13,93,371,2435,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Social behaviors elevate predation risk in fiddler crabs: quantitative evidence from field observations,"The flight initiation distance model predicts that prey initiates to escape at a point where the cost of staying exceeds its benefits that they acquire from staying, such as the availability of food resources and mates. Social behaviors, such as courtship or territorial behaviors can generally increase reproductive success, although they have the potential to attract predators. Using refuge enhances the probability of survival. Therefore, for prey, social behaviors increase the benefits, and the use of refuge decreases the costs of staying. However, most empirical studies testing these predictions have used human approaches as predator mimics and have not represented natural predation events in the field. We quantified predator-prey interactions between the predator, the varunid crab (Helicana japonica), and its prey, the fiddler crab (Austruca lactea), based on field observations. We then demonstrated the effects of social behaviors and distance from a refuge on predation risk and the adjustment of distance according to the predator-prey distance. Fiddler crabs adjusted the prey-prey burrow distances according to the predator-prey distance when it was < 45 cm. When > 45 cm, the prey-prey burrow distances did not influence it. The varunid crabs were shown to target prey that were closer in distance. Predators physically reached prey that were further from their burrows. These results show that predation risk caused prey to regulate prey-prey burrow distances according to predator-prey distances. In addition, varunid crabs frequently contacted fiddler crabs that employed social behaviors, suggesting that social behaviors elevated predation risk. Significance statement We quantified predator-prey interactions between the predatory varunid crab and the prey fiddler crab from field observations. We demonstrated that fiddler crabs adjusted their distance from their burrows according to the predator-prey distances. Varunid crabs targeted prey that were closer. Prey that were reached by the predator were situated further away from their burrows and frequently employed social behaviors. These results suggest that the social behaviors of prey elevate predation risk, although prey adjust the distance from the burrow according to the predator-prey distance.",Austruca lactea; Courtship; Helicana japonica; Predator-prey interaction; Refuge; Territorial fighting,2022,76,12,10.1007/s00265-022-03268-5,0340-5443,13,103,331,2286,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Timing matters: female receptivity and mate choice in the zebrafish (Danio rerio),"Female choice has been documented in many animal taxa, and how we test it has been refined through years of studies on the topic. However, when designing mate choice experiments some variables, surprisingly, often remain overlooked, including receptivity and reproductive stage. Here, we aimed to assess whether the female reproductive stage influences strength and direction of mate choice in the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Females were offered a choice between two males differing in body size. We found that female choice in our experimental setup was significantly repeatable and that females preferred larger males. Nonetheless, the level of choosiness of females was affected by the time since the last spawning. Females spent more time choosing when tested 7 and 10 days after spawning rather than 4 days, indicating a higher receptivity to males from one week after the last spawning. Moreover, females preferred larger males only when tested 7 and 10 days after spawning. Our results suggest that female mate choice should take female receptivity into account, by standardizing time since the last spawning across females. More broadly, this suggests that 7-10 days since the previous spawning is the ideal time interval for zebrafish female receptivity to peak, with implications for facilities and researchers to increase egg production in natural spawning events and manual egg collection. Significance statement The role of pre-copulatory female mate preference has long been recognized in sexual selection. Nonetheless, female receptivity often remains overlooked in mate choice experiments especially in external fertilizing species. In the present study, we investigated if the female reproductive stage affects the strength and direction of female mate choice in an external fertilizing fish, the zebrafish, Danio rerio. We found that, when tested 7 and 10 days after spawning rather than 4 days, females spent more time choosing, demonstrating an increased receptivity to males from 1 week following the last spawning. Furthermore, only at 7 and 10 days after spawning females exibith a clear preference for the bigger males. Our study highlights the importance of considering the female receptivity in future studies assessing mate choices in this and other externally fertilizing species, and also for zebrafish facilities to increase egg production in natural spawning events and manual egg collection.",Reproductive Cycle; Mate choice; Choosiness; Sexual selection,2022,76,11,10.1007/s00265-022-03255-w,0340-5443,12,81,366,2420,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,Two coinhabitants visually lure prey to host territory through a shared conspicuous trait,"Visual prey luring in animals is typically achieved by brightly colored body parts or excretions of the signal sender, and using signals from other organisms is rarely reported. However, certain species of kleptoparasitic Argyrodes spiders usually reside in the webs of Cyrtophora spiders, and their brightly colored bodies have been demonstrated to serve as a visual lure that attracts prey to host webs. The golden orb-web spider Nephila pilipes spins giant orb webs and also attracts web coinhabitants such as mate-seeking males and kleptoparasitic spider Argyrodes miniaceus. These two types of spiders have similar orange-red body coloration, leading us to investigate the function of this shared trait by manipulating their body color and recording the response of prey insects in the field using video cameras. Our results showed that, in both diurnal and nocturnal conditions, female N. pilipes webs with naturally colored male N. pilipes and A. miniaceus had a significantly higher prey attraction rate than those with body color altered coinhabitants. Specifically, A. miniaceus lure more prey at nighttime. These results indicate that the conspicuously colored web coinhabitants may potentially bring foraging benefits to the hosts through prey luring and provide new perspectives on the ecology and evolution of symbiotic relationships between animals. Significance statement It has been known that the body coloration of some spiders can lure prey to their webs, and even some kleptoparasitic Argyrodes spiders can lure prey to their hosts' webs. However, whether the conspicuous body coloration of mate-seeking males plays any role remains untested. We showed for the first time that the orange-red body coloration shared by male Nephila pilipes and kleptoparasitic Argyrodes miniaceus spiders inhabiting webs of female N. pilipes can visually lure prey. Findings of this study can potentially strengthen our current understanding of the function of body coloration of spiders, shed light on evolution of spider body coloration, and provide new perspectives on symbiotic relationships between animals.",Argyrodes miniaceus; Color contrast; Nephila pilipes; Prey lure,2022,76,11,10.1007/s00265-022-03249-8,0340-5443,13,89,316,2115,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,An evaluation of freshwater monitoring programs in ILTER nodes and mountain national parks: identifying key variables to monitor global change effects,"Identifying and quantifying global change impacts on biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems is critical to promote an effective adaptation that increases the success of conservation strategies. To achieve this goal, global and regional assessment efforts require certain degree of harmonization on local monitoring programs to establish relevant comparisons at different spatio-temporal scales. Otherwise, the lack of harmonization might hinder the detection and assessment on the effects of human impacts. In this work we have compiled information on freshwater monitoring programs located in areas of intensive research and conservation interest: International Long Term Ecological Research (ILTER) nodes and mountain National Parks. We aimed at evaluating the quality and robustness of these programs to assess the impact of global change, addressing from the worldwide to the European and Spanish national scale. Results highlighted that freshwater monitoring programs lack a common strategy to monitor these ecosystems. Even at the continental and national scales, contrasting strategies and level of detail have been historically applied. Water quality, habitat and biodiversity are more commonly monitored than community structure and ecosystem functioning. Monitoring efforts on the Spanish Mountain National parks indicated differences on the targeted aquatic ecosystems. Rivers and lakes received a higher attention, while mires were rarely considered. Our results provide evidence that greater efforts should be directed towards constructing a coordinated strategy to monitor freshwater ecosystems at national, continental, and global scales. This strategy should involve a shared backbone of biophysical and biogeochemical variables for each habitat type on agreed protocols that are implemented across regions and administrative borders. Achieving this will support a substantial advance on the ecological research to further delineate proper conservation strategies to face the challenges imposed by global change.",Monitoring; Mountains; Freshwater Ecosystems; Research sites; Conservation areas,2023,32,1,10.1007/s10531-022-02466-x,0960-3115,21,150,280,2033,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,Automatic recorders monitor wolves at rendezvous sites: do wolves adjust howling to live near humans?,"We used automatic sound recorders to study spontaneous vocalizations of wild wolves during the pup-rearing season around rendezvous sites from 24 wolf packs in six study areas across North America, Asia, and Europe. Between 2018 and 2021, for a total of 1225 pack-days, we recorded 605 spontaneous wolf chorus howls and 224 solo-howl series. Howling occurrence varied across areas, from 12.50 to 94.12\% days with howling. Daily howling ranged from 0.00 to 3.47 solo howls/day and 0.13 to 5.29 chorus howls/day. Generally, spontaneous chorus howls peaked between sunset and sunrise. Howling rate depended on area, pack size, and density of people living nearby, being greater where fewer people lived. High rates in Yellowstone National Park, (800,000+ visitors during the study) could reflect accommodation to human activities such as wolf watching. One to six automatic recorders per site within 1000 m of rendezvous sites needed 4-15 days to detect the pack (average 9.5) and 5-21 days (average 11.3) to detect pups, both with a probability of 95\%.

BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,Grassland afforestation with Eucalyptus affect Collembola communities and soil functions in southern Brazil,"Afforestation of subtropical grasslands increased during the last decade and their impacts on soil biota and functions are not well known. Here we investigated the effects of grassland afforestation with Eucalyptus on soil Collembola communities in southern Brazil. By using paired transects (native grassland vs. plantation), we assessed Collembola taxonomic and functional composition and diversity and their relations with plant diversity and soil microbial and physical-chemical parameters. Eucalyptus plantations significantly decreased plant richness, soil pH, and soil temperature. Microbial biomass, soil basal respiration and enzyme activities were negatively affected by grassland afforestation, which may indicate an effect on decomposition, soil fertility, and carbon stock. At a regional scale, grassland afforestation diminished the richness, and at a local scale changed the taxonomic and functional composition of Collembola communities. An environmental filtering mechanism is suggested triggering trait turnover from open (grassland) to a closed canopy habitat (tree plantation). While grassland presented high abundance of larger, eyed, and pigmented Collembola, Eucalyptus favored smaller, blind, and non-pigmented Collembola with shadow-adapted sensorial structures.

BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,Mediterranean grassland succession as an indicator of changes in ecosystem biodiversity and functionality,"The abandonment of agricultural lands triggers a secondary succession of plant species which implies important changes in soil quality. Annual Mediterranean grasslands are known to be persistent on abandoned agriculture lands in the western Mediterranean. We used plant taxonomic and functional approaches to determine the role of Mediterranean grasslands as an indicator of changes in ecosystem biodiversity and functionality. We tested the hypothesis that Mediterranean grasslands are a suitable model for monitoring biodiversity and soil fertility in a secondary succession. Soil and vegetation features on 21 permanent plots were monitored in 2016 and 2020. Numerical classifications based on floristic composition showed two different plant communities independently of the sampling year: early-stage grasslands in the first post-abandonment decade and late-stage grasslands after the first post-abandonment decade. Generalized linear model and redundancy analysis also revealed differences in growth forms, functional traits and soil functionality between communities. Late-stage grasslands was characterized by enriched bryophyte coverage and an impoverishment in hemicryptophytes and plant latex segregators growing on soils with a higher hydrolase enzyme activity and TOC content compared to early-stage grassland. Our results suggest that annual Mediterranean grasslands growing on siliceous soils denoting a mature-stage succession, and floristically characterized by the symbiont plant with Ascomycota, Tuberaria guttata, and a high bryophyte cover, are worthy of recognition for conservation.",Abandoned agrosystems; Annual dry grasslands; Secondary succession; Short-term; Soil biology,2023,32,1,10.1007/s10531-022-02481-y,0960-3115,13,105,214,1605,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,"A European nudibranch new to the Gulf of Maine: Doris pseudoargus Rapp, 1827","The Gulf of Maine (GOM) has seen an increasing number of introduced species, some of which have significantly impacted benthic community structure. In 2017, a number of specimens of the European dorid nudibranch, Doris pseudoargus, were observed on rocky ledges in waters off Cape Ann, Massachusetts. The presence of numerous specimens and egg masses suggested the species had been established before 2017. Additional field observations and literature searches revealed specimens occurring from Nova Scotia to the northern end of the Cape Cod Canal, which poses the question, when and where did the initial introduction take place and how? Genetic analysis confirmed the species as Doris pseudoargus with genomic similarities to specimens from Northern Europe. Until this introduction, the GOM had only one species of sponge feeding nudibranch, Cadlina laevis, which is a trophic specialist on one genus of sponge. Unlike this endemic, stenotrophic feeding dorid, the introduction of another large sized, sponge predator known to feed on diverse sponge species, that occur from the intertidal to at least 25 m in depth has the potential to significantly impact community structure over a wide variety of hard bottom habitats.",Dorid nudibranch; Sponge predator; Introduced species; European; Gulf of Maine; Community impact,2023,25,2,10.1007/s10530-022-02917-0,1387-3547,13,76,188,1225,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,An interdisciplinary assessment of the impact of invasive gelatinous zooplankton in a French Mediterranean lagoon,"Gelatinous zooplankton species can cause great concerns on biodiversity and human activities. But there is a lack of knowledge on its current sociological impact on humans. In the Berre Lagoon (Southeast of France), survey have been done to study the population dynamics of three gelatinous species (Mnemiopsis leidyi, Aurelia sp., and Gonionemus vertens) in relation with the environment. As part of the ``biological survey{''} (2015-2017), an interdisciplinary approach was performed to combine field measurements with perception through testimonies of social actors across a ``sociological survey{''}. The human ``perception{'' and the field ``measurements{''} were linked along the framework of risk: Risk = hazard x vulnerability. The invasive ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was the most abundant species in the Berre Lagoon causing high impacts on human activities, in particular on the artisanal fisheries the most affected human activity by M. leidyi involving the human (i.e. hard work), the technical (i.e. deterioration of fishing nets, clogs nets, mutilation of fish), and the economic losses representing 50\% of their annual revenue. The clogging of the nets affected not only the quantity of fish but also their quality, as they were smothered and mutilated. The data collected allowed us to estimate an abundance tolerance threshold (similar to 10 ind m(-3)) by social actors, above which M. leidyi was considered to be a nuisance. Beach goers accept relatively well M. leidyi, mainly because it does not sting. Up to the abundance tolerance threshold defined in our study, beach goers escaped from the lagoon, favored the sea or the pool. Even if they are highly impacted by M. leidyi, the fishermen showed an ability to changed they practices by a cohabitation and technical responses (i.e., increase the number of trips and the duration of the setting of nets). Finally, the recent arrival in 2016 of the stinging invasive hydromedusa G. vertens can causes some health issues on fishermen and beach goers in the future in the Berre Lagoon.",Mediterranean lagoon; Mnemiopsis leidyi; Aurelia sp; Gonionemus vertens; Interdisciplinarity; Socio-ecology,2023,25,2,10.1007/s10530-022-02930-3,1387-3547,15,113,320,2056,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,Biotic resistance or invasional meltdown? Diversity reduces invasibility but not exotic dominance in southern California epibenthic communities,"High community diversity may either prevent or promote the establishment of exotic species. The biotic resistance hypothesis holds that species-rich communities are more resistant to invasion than species-poor communities due to mechanisms including greater interspecific competition. Conversely, the invasional meltdown hypothesis proposes that greater exotic diversity increases invasibility via facilitative interactions between exotic species. To evaluate the degree to which biotic resistance or invasional meltdown influences marine community structure during the assembly period, we studied the development of marine epibenthic ``fouling{''} communities at two southern California harbors. With a focus on sessile epibenthic species, we found that fewer exotic species established as total and exotic richness increased during community assembly and that this effect remained after accounting for space availability. We also found that changes in exotic abundance decreased over time. Throughout the assembly period, gains in exotic abundance were greatest when space was abundant and richness was low. Altogether, we found greater support for biotic resistance than invasional meltdown, suggesting that both native and exotic species contribute to biotic resistance during early development of these communities. However, our results indicate that biotic resistance may not always reduce the eventual dominance of exotic species.",Biotic resistance; Invasional meltdown; Diversity; Epibenthic; Dominance; Community assembly,2023,25,2,10.1007/s10530-022-02932-1,1387-3547,17,143,194,1437,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,Conservation of endangered galaxiid fishes in the Falkland Islands requires urgent action on invasive brown trout,"Non-native salmonids are protected in the Southern hemisphere where they sustain aquaculture and lucrative sport fisheries, but also impact many native fishes, which poses a conservation conundrum. Legal protection and human-assisted secondary releases may have helped salmonids to spread, but this has seldom been tested. We reconstructed the introduction of brown trout (Salmo trutta) to the Falkland Islands using historical records and modelled its dispersal and probability of invasion using a generalized linear model and Leave One out Cross Validation. Our results indicate that establishment success was similar to 88\%, and that dispersal was facilitated over land by proximity to invaded sites and density of stream-road crossings, suggesting it was human assisted. Brown trout have already invaded 54\% of Falkland rivers, which are 2.9-4.5 times less likely to contain native galaxiids than uninvaded streams. Without strong containment we predict brown trout will invade nearly all suitable freshwater habitats in the Falklands within the next similar to 70 years, which might put native freshwater fishes at a high risk of extinction.",Invasive species; Translocations; Risk management; Invasion risk competitive exclusion,2023,25,4,10.1007/s10530-022-02959-4,1387-3547,16,113,170,1148,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Traditional methods to detect invasive species are time consuming and cumbersome, with a requisite for trained taxonomists for identification of aquatic species. Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based molecular methods offer an alternative, as they are quick, cost-effective and require minimal manpower. In this study, we design and optimize a reliable eDNA-based quantitative PCR assay to detect the African Sharptooth catfish, a highly invasive and banned species in India.

BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,"Eaten out of house and home: local extinction of Abrolhos painted button-quail Turnix varius scintillans due to invasive mice, herbivores and rainfall decline","Island avifauna suffer high rates of extinction and decline. North Island in the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, Western Australia, supports one of three populations of the Abrolhos Painted Button-quail (Turnix varius scintillans), a subspecies determined to be the 5th most likely taxon to become extinct in Australia. T. v. scintillans were last recorded on North Island in 2006. Vegetation declines on North Island due to introduced tammar wallabies (Notamacropus eugenii derbianus) and predation by introduced house mice (Mus musculus) are implicated as major threats. Between 2018 and 2021, 12,820 camera trap-nights on North Island failed to detect any signs of T. v. scintillans, suggesting local extinction. We deployed rodent chew cards at each camera site and analysed rainfall and vegetation cover data to identify potential causes of decline. Vegetation cover change was related to tammar wallaby density and was highly correlated with rainfall (r(2) = 0.75). At the time of the last button-quail sighting in 2006, tammar wallaby numbers were at their peak, and annual rainfall was near its lowest level. Introduced tammar wallabies and house mice in tandem with reduced rainfall have likely resulted in degradation of habitat critical for T. v. scintillans, which is now confined to just two islands. Preventing further introductions of mice, rats and feral cats is a high priority for limiting further declines of this subspecies.",Island; Bird; Camera traps; Introduced rodents; Island avifauna; Vegetation change,2023,25,4,10.1007/s10530-022-02966-5,1387-3547,23,158,221,1442,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,Effects of interactions between abiotic and biotic factors on growth of a non-native macrophyte,"Invasive macrophytes are troublesome in a myriad of freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Before causing threats to recipient communities, invasive species face abiotic and biotic environmental factors during colonization and establishment that may hamper their success. We experimentally investigated the separate effects of one abiotic factor (sediment organic matter) and two biotic factors (competition and herbivory), along with their interactions, on the growth of the exotic species Hydrilla verticillata in its invasive range. We found that herbivory by the native mollusk Pomacea canaliculata, competition with the native macrophyte Egeria najas and high organic matter in sediment negatively impacted the performance of the exotic species in terms of plant height, biomass production and branching. However, the intensity of each limiting factor depends on the presence of a second factor, as indicated by significant interactions between sediment type x herbivory and competition x herbivory. Our most important finding was that these three factors act synergistically, with a disproportional significant negative impact on the exotic macrophyte. Because the native competitor and herbivore we used occur in lakes with high organic matter in the sediment, our findings help to explain why H. verticillata has still not colonized several aquatic habitats (i.e., floodplain lakes) in South America.",Invasive species; Exotic species; Hydrilla verticillata; Biotic resistance hypothesis; Sediment organic matter,2023,25,2,10.1007/s10530-022-02924-1,1387-3547,14,95,200,1402,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,Plant invasion drives liana and tree community assemblages and liana-tree network structure in two moist semi-deciduous forests in Ghana,"Invasive plants are one of the greatest threats leading to biodiversity loss and species extinction worldwide. Understanding the responses of liana and tree communities as well as liana-tree interactions to plant invasion could be important in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem functioning, but there is limited knowledge on this subject matter. We therefore sought to determine how the diversity, composition and structure of native liana and tree communities and liana-tree interaction networks responded to invasion by three tree species (Broussonetia papyrifera, Cedrela odorata, Tectona grandis) in two moist semi-deciduous forests in Ghana. Effects of plant invasion on native liana and tree community structure and liana-tree network structure were quantified by sampling liana species with diameter at 1.30 m from rooting base >= 1 cm, and tree species with diameter at breast height >= 5 cm in 20 20 x 20 m plots each in non-invaded and invaded sites. The findings of the study showed that plant invasion was associated with lower diversity and abundance of lianas and trees as well as shifts in species composition of the plants. Our results revealed that plant invasion influenced the patterns of liana-tree network structure, and tended to cause an increase in network connectance and nestedness, and a decrease in network modularity and specialisation. Plant invasion drove the topological roles of a few liana and tree species in the invaded sites. Generally, species abundance and specificity were important correlates of nestedness, and modularity and species roles of the networks. We conclude that the invasive tree species drove native liana and tree community structure, degree of liana-tree network structure, and species topological roles, all of which may have adverse consequences on biodiversity in the forests.",Invasive plant species; Modularity; Nestedness; Plant invasion; Specialisation; Species diversity and composition,2023,25,2,10.1007/s10530-022-02933-0,1387-3547,19,136,279,1842,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,A generalized approach to characterize optical properties of natural objects,"To understand the diversity of ways in which natural materials interact with light, it is important to consider how their reflectance changes with the angle of illumination or viewing and to consider wavelengths beyond the visible. Efforts to characterize these optical properties, however, have been hampered by heterogeneity in measurement techniques, parameters and terminology. Here, we propose a standardized set of measurements, parameters and terminology to describe the optical properties of natural objects based on spectrometry, including angle-dependent effects, such as iridescence and specularity. We select a set of existing measurements and parameters that are generalizable to any wavelength range and spectral shape, and we highlight which subsets of measures are relevant to different biological questions. As a case study, we have applied these measures to 30 species of Christmas beetles, in which we observed previously unrealized diversity in visible and near-infrared reflectance. As expected, reflection of short wavelengths was associated with high spectral purity and angle dependence. In contrast to simple, artificial structures, iridescence and specularity were not strongly correlated, highlighting the complexity and modularity of natural materials. Species did not cluster according to spectral parameters or genus, suggesting high lability of optical properties. The proposed standardization of measures and parameters will improve our understanding of biological adaptations for manipulating light by facilitating the systematic comparison of complex optical properties, such as glossy or metallic appearances and visible or near-infrared iridescence.",beetles; iridescence; near infrared; spectrometry; specularity; structural colour,2022,137,3,10.1093/biolinnean/blac064,0024-4066,10,76,232,1685,6,NA,200,10,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,A potential deimatic display revealed in a lizard,"Conspicuously coloured signals may evolve via sexual selection to be ornaments or armaments, thereby conferring a fitness advantage to their bearer. Conversely, conspicuous colours may also evolve under natural selection as either aposematic signals or deimatic displays that deter attacks from predators. While conspicuous colour patches may evolve for one purpose (e.g. quality indicators), they may later be co-opted for another (e.g. anti-predator defence). Phrynocephalus mystaceus is a cryptic agamid lizard with flaps in both sexes that when folded against the head are inconspicuous, but when deployed are predicted to be highly conspicuous and to increase the appearance of body size. We tested whether head flaps play a role in social signalling via courtship or as status signals during contests in both sexes. We also tested whether the head flaps have an anti-predator function by simulating predatory encounters. Head flaps were never deployed in courtship or during contests and, therefore, are unlikely to be under sexual selection. However, head flaps and their deployment during simulated predatory encounters were consistent with the predictions associated with deimatic display theory. First, head flaps were similar in form and function between sexes. Second, they were highly conspicuous to both avian and snake predators. Third, there was a rapid transition from crypsis to conspicuousness when they deployed their head flaps during a late stage of predation, the subjugation phase, consistent with an ambush.

BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,Climate aridity and habitat drive geographical variation in morphology and thermo-hydroregulation strategies of a widespread lizard species,"Thermo-hydroregulation strategies involve concurrent changes in functional traits related to energy, water balance and thermoregulation and play a key role in determining life-history traits and population demography of terrestrial ectotherms. Local thermal and hydric conditions should be important drivers of the geographical variation of thermo-hydroregulation strategies, but we lack studies that examine these changes across climatic gradients in different habitat types. Here, we investigated intraspecific variation of morphology and thermo-hydroregulation traits in the widespread European common lizard (Zootoca vivipara louislantzi) across a multidimensional environmental gradient involving independent variation in air temperature and rainfall and differences in habitat features (access to free-standing water and forest cover). We sampled adult males for morphology, resting metabolic rate, total and cutaneous evaporative water loss and thermal preferences in 15 populations from the rear to the leading edge of the distribution across an elevational gradient ranging from sea level to 1750 m. Besides a decrease in adult body size with increasing environmental temperatures, we found little effect of thermal conditions on thermo-hydroregulation strategies. In particular, relict lowland populations from the warm rear edge showed no specific ecophysiological adaptations. Instead, body mass, body condition and resting metabolic rate were positively associated with a rainfall gradient, while forest cover and water access in the habitat throughout the season also influenced cutaneous evaporative water loss. Our study emphasizes the importance of rainfall and habitat features rather than thermal conditions for geographical variation in lizard morphology and physiology.",aridity; evaporative water loss; lizards; metabolism; morphology; reptiles; thermal preferences,2022,137,4,10.1093/biolinnean/blac114,0024-4066,17,139,239,1790,7,NA,200,10,No,225,175,yes,no,yes

However, the covariation of the rostral and caudal modules within adaptive zones, where specializations may impose constraints on morphological diversification, remains unknown. Here we used phylogenetic linear models and accounted for phylogenetic uncertainty to examine the evolutionary relationship between brain volume-as a proxy for neurocranium size-and palate morphology in 42 species of specialized frugivores of the subfamily Stenodermatinae. We found that the palate surface area increased and became relatively wider as brain size increased. This pattern may be pervasive in frugivorous phyllostomids, although different lineages may show different rates of covariation.

BIOLOGY LETTERS,Small-amplitude head oscillations result from a multimodal head stabilization reflex in hawkmoths,"In flying insects, head stabilization is an essential reflex that helps to reduce motion blur during fast aerial manoeuvres. This reflex is multimodal and requires the integration of visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback in hawkmoths, each operating as a negative-feedback-control loop. As in any negative-feedback system, the head stabilization system possesses inherent oscillatory dynamics that depend on the rate at which the sensorimotor components of the reflex operate. Consistent with this expectation, we observed small-amplitude oscillations in the head motion (or head wobble) of the oleander hawkmoth, Daphnis nerii, which are accentuated when sensory feedback is aberrant. Here, we show that these oscillations emerge from the inherent dynamics of the multimodal reflex underlying gaze stabilization, and that the amplitude of head wobble is a function of both the visual feedback and antennal mechanosensory feedback from the Johnston's organs.

Shifts in the timing of these events could have important population implications directly, or provide information about the mechanisms driving population trajectories, especially if they differ between life cycle event. We examine if such shifts occur in a declining migratory passerine bird (willow warbler, Phylloscopus trochilus), which exhibits latitudinally diverging population trajectories. We find evidence of phenological shifts in breeding initiation, breeding progression and moult that differ across geographic and spring temperature gradients. Moult initiation following warmer springs advances faster in the south than in the north, resulting in proportionally shorter breeding seasons, reflecting higher nest failure rates in the south and in warmer years. Tracking shifts in multiple life cycle events allowed us to identify points of failure in the breeding cycle in regions where the species has negative population trends, thereby demonstrating the utility of phenology analyses for illuminating mechanistic pathways underlying observed population trajectories.",phenology; moult; annual cycle; breeding; climate change; population change,2022,18,8,10.1098/rsbl.2022.0186,1744-9561,13,101,164,1196,6,20,200,NA,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
BIOLOGY LETTERS,Dance-communicated distances support nectar foraging as a supply-driven system,"Much like human consumers, honeybees adjust their behaviours based on resources' supply and demand. For both, interactions occur in fluctuating conditions. Honeybees weigh the cost of flight against the benefit of nectar and pollen, which are nutritionally distinct resources that serve different purposes: bees collect nectar continuously to build large honey stores for overwintering, but they collect pollen intermittently to build modest stores for brood production periods. Therefore, nectar foraging can be considered a supply-driven process, whereas pollen foraging is demand-driven. Here we compared the foraging distances, communicated by waggle dances and serving as a proxy for cost, for nectar and pollen in three ecologically distinct landscapes in Virginia. We found that honeybees foraged for nectar at distances 14\% further than for pollen across all three sites (n = 6224 dances, p < 0.001). Specific temporal dynamics reveal that monthly nectar foraging occurs at greater distances compared with pollen foraging 85\% of the time.

In particular, in the fish family Poeciliidae there is an evolutionary link between placentotrophy and superfetation (ability of females to simultaneously bear embryos at distinct developmental stages), with no conclusive evidence for which of these two traits facilitates the evolution of more advanced degrees of the other. Using a robust phylogenetic comparative method based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models of adaptive evolution and data from 36 poeciliid species, we detected a clear causality pattern. The evolution of extensive placentotrophy has been facilitated by the preceding evolution of more simultaneous broods. Therefore, placentas became increasingly complex as an adaptive response to evolutionary increases in the degree of superfetation. This finding represents a substantial contribution to our knowledge of the factors that have shaped placental evolution in poeciliid fishes.",lecithotrophy; matrotrophy; placentas; simultaneous broods; viviparity,2022,18,10,10.1098/rsbl.2022.0173,1744-9561,17,131,156,1128,5,20,200,NA,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
BIOLOGY LETTERS,Biological adaptations for cultural transmission?,"According to several interlinked and influential lines of argument, human minds have been shaped by natural selection so as to include biological adaptations with the evolved, naturally selected function to facilitate the transmission of cultural knowledge. This `cultural minds' hypothesis has proved highly influential, and if it is correct it is a major step forward in understanding how and why humans have survived and prospered in a hugely diverse range of ecologies. It can be contrasted with a `social minds' hypothesis, according to which cultural transmission occurs as an outcome, but not the biologically evolved function, of social cognition the domain of which is relatively small-group interaction. Here, I critique the cultural minds hypothesis and I argue that the data favour the social minds perspective. Cultural phenomena can clearly emerge and persist over time without cognitive adaptations for cultural transmission.

BIOTROPICA,Factors limiting plant recruitment in a tropical Afromontane Forest,"Predicting how forest species composition may change in response to global change is essential for meaningful management. Which species are most likely to successfully recruit depends on a multitude of factors, but processes operating at the seed-to-seedling transition being especially important. Here, we explore how insufficient seed dispersal (dispersal limitation) and ecological filtering of seedlings (establishment limitation) influence species recruitment in an Afromontane Forest. We combined census data from seeds in seed traps and seed-seedling transition plots in a Nigerian montane forest to measure dispersal and establishment limitation across species, life history strategies, and seed sizes. From 106 seed traps and 318 seedling plots, we recorded 11,278 seeds from 38 species and 2688 seedlings of 61 species. All species except for one liana showed strong dispersal limitation while 23 out of the 30 species showed establishment limitation. The two lianas sampled had significantly lower dispersal limitation compared to the trees investigated in the study. Our results suggest that both dispersal and establishment limitation are markedly high in this Afromontane forest than would be expected in a lowland counterpart.",lianas; montane forest; Nigeria; recruitment limitation; seed rain; seed-to-seedling transition,2023,55,1,10.1111/btp.13179,0006-3606,9,67,178,1241,6,12,250,8,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
BIOTROPICA,High diversity and low specificity of fungi associated with seedless epiphytic plants,"Epiphytes, which grow on other plants for support, make up a large portion of Earth's plant diversity. Like other plants, their surfaces and interiors are colonized by diverse assemblages of fungi that can benefit their hosts by increasing tolerance for abiotic stressors and resistance to disease or harm them as pathogens. Fungal communities associated with epiphytic plants and the processes that structure these communities are poorly known. To address this, we sampled seven epiphytic seedless plant taxa in a Costa Rican rainforest and examined the effects of host identity and microhabitat on external and endophytic fungal communities. We found low host specificity for both external and endophytic fungi and weak differentiation between epiphytic and neighboring epilithic plant hosts. High turnover in fungi within and between hosts and habitats reveals that epiphytic plant-associated fungal communities are highly diverse and suggests that they are structured by stochastic processes.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material",bryophytes; Costa Rica; ferns; fungal community; host specificity,2023,55,1,10.1111/btp.13183,0006-3606,12,85,153,1049,5,12,250,8,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes

To further understand the ecological context of these evolutionary relationships, we have examined the population-genetic structure of the fungus-growing ant species Mycetomoellerius mikromelanos Cardenas, Schultz, Adams 2021 in the Panama Canal Zone. We specifically investigated the presence of population structure, the significance of geographic features (i.e., creeks) limiting gene flow, and relatedness between ant colonies. To accomplish this, we genotyped 85 ant colonies from nine creeks across an approximately 30 km transect in Parque National Soberania, Panama, using double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing. We did not find distinct population structure using two genetic clustering methods; however, we did detect an effect of isolation by distance. Furthermore, related colonies were frequently detected on the same creek or neighboring creeks, and some at further geographic distances. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that new colonies tend to establish on natal creeks and occasionally on distant creeks following long-distance dispersal events. We discuss how population-genetic patterns reveal the natural history of M. mikromelanos in Parque National Soberania and how these results fit into the context of fungus-growing ant mutualisms.

BIOTROPICA,Trophic cascades in tropical rainforests: Effects of vertebrate predator exclusion on arthropods and plants in Papua New Guinea,"Insect herbivores have the potential to consume large amounts of plant tissue in tropical forests, but insectivorous vertebrates effectively control their abundances, indirectly increasing plant fitness accordingly. Despite several studies already sought understanding of the top-down effects on arthropod community structure and herbivory, such studies of trophic cascades in old tropics are underrepresented, and little attention was paid to top-down forces in various habitats. Therefore, we examine how flying insectivorous vertebrates (birds and bats) impact arthropods and, consequently, affect herbivore damage of leaves in forest habitats in Papua New Guinea. In a 3-month long predator exclosure experiment conducted at four study sites across varying elevation and successional stage, we found that vertebrate predators reduced arthropod density by similar to 52\%. In addition, vertebrate predators decreased the mean body size of arthropods by 26\% in leaf chewers and 47\% in non-herbivorous arthropods but had only a small effect on mesopredators and sap suckers. Overall, the exclusion of vertebrate predators resulted in a similar to 41\% increase in leaf damage. Our results, across different types of tropical forests in Papua New Guinea, demonstrate that flying vertebrate insectivores have a crucial impact on plant biomass, create a selective pressure on larger and non-predatory prey individuals and they prey partition with mesopredators.",herbivory; Intraguild predation; top-down control; vertebrate predator exclusion,2023,55,1,10.1111/btp.13160,0006-3606,18,127,208,1461,4,12,250,8,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Evidence for a chemical arms race between cuckoo wasps of the genus Hedychrum and their distantly related host apoid wasps,"Background Brood parasites can exert strong selection pressure on their hosts. Many brood parasites escape their detection by mimicking sensory cues of their hosts. However, there is little evidence whether or not the hosts are able to escape the parasites' mimicry by changing these cues. We addressed this question by analyzing cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles of Cerceris and Philanthus wasps and their brood parasites, cuckoo wasps mimicking the CHC profiles of their hosts. Some of these hosts use hydrocarbons to preserve their prey against fungal infestation and thus, they cannot significantly change their CHC composition in response to chemical mimicry by Hedychrum brood parasites. Results We found that the CHC overlap between brood parasites and their hosts was lower in case of host wasps not preserving their prey than in case of prey-preserving host wasps, whose CHC evolution is constrained. Furthermore, the CHC profiles in non-preserving host wasps is more strongly diversified in females than in males, thus in the sex that is chemically mimicked by brood parasites. Conclusion Our results provide evidence for a chemical arms race between those hosts that are liberated from stabilizing selection on their chemical template and their parasites.",Chemical mimicry; Chrysididae; Cuticular hydrocarbons; Evolutionary arms race; Hymenoptera; Philanthidae,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02093-8,NA,20,122,194,1269,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Unveiling a hotspot of genetic diversity in southern Italy for the endangered Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni,"Background Hotspots of intraspecific genetic diversity represent invaluable resources for species to cope with environmental changes, and their identification is increasingly recognized as a major goal of conservation ecology research. However, even for iconic and endangered species, conservation strategies are often planned without thorough information on the geographic patterns of genetic variation. Here, we investigated the spatial patterns of genetic variation of the endangered Hermann's tortoise Testudo hermanni in the Italian Peninsula by genotyping 174 individuals at 7 microsatellite loci, with the aim to contribute to planning effective conservation strategies. Results Ordination-based and Bayesian clustering analyses consistently identified three main genetic clusters, one spread in the central and northern part of the peninsula, and two restricted to southern Italy and Sicily, respectively. The highest levels of genetic diversity were found in populations of the southern cluster and, in particular, at the northern edges of its distribution (He > 0.6, Ar > 2.8 ), that correspond to areas of putative secondary contact and admixture between distinct lineages. Our results clearly identify a hotspot of genetic diversity for the Hermann's tortoise in southern Italy. Conclusion We inferred the evolutionary history and the spatial patterns of genetic variation of the Hermann's tortoise in the Italian Peninsula. We identified three main genetic clusters along the peninsula and a hotspot of intraspecific diversity in southern Italy. Our results underline the urgent need for conservation actions to warrant the long-term persistence of viable tortoise populations in this area.

BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Sex-specific effects of inbreeding on body colouration and physiological colour change in the cichlid fish Pelvicachromis taeniatus,"Background Colour expression is highly variable in animals. In fishes, rapid colour change, i.e. physiological colour change, can be observed in multiple contexts, e.g. in camouflage or communication, and is affected by various factors, such as stress. Pelvicachromis taeniatus is a cichlid fish from West Africa with sexual dichromatism and both sexes being brightly coloured and flexible in ornament expression. In the present study, inbred and outbred P. taeniatus were photographed before and after a stress situation to investigate the stress response regarding colour expression in both sexes. Results The chromaticity and the colour patch size (relative coloured area at the abdomen) were determined at both timepoints and the changes were analysed. Additionally, the coefficients of variation within family groups for the chromaticity (CVchromaticity) and colour patch size (CVarea) were calculated. Chromaticity as well as the extent of colouration increased significantly following handling stress. The change in chromaticity was not significantly different between in- and outbred individuals in females and males. Inbred males showed more intense yellow colouration than outbred males. Independent from inbreeding, the CVchromaticity decreased following the handling stress. The change in CVarea of females and males differed between in- and outbred individuals. In females, the decrease was significantly stronger in inbred individuals and in males the decrease was stronger in the outbred group. Conclusion The results show that short-term stress can increase colouration, potentially advertising individual's stress tolerance. Furthermore, this study shows positive inbreeding effects on a sexually selected trait.",Sexual ornamentation; Stress response; Inbreeding; Colour variation; Dynamic colour expression,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02074-x,NA,17,131,243,1729,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Assessing soil microbes that drive fairy ring patterns in temperate semiarid grasslands,"Background Fairy rings occur in diverse global biomes; however, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding drivers of fairy rings in grassland ecosystems. Grassland fairy rings are characterized belowground by an expanding mycelial front and aboveground by vigorous vegetation rings that develop concentrically with each growing season. We evaluated fairy ring dynamics in a field study conducted in semiarid grasslands to elucidate above- and belowground interactions driving distinct vegetation patterns. We followed this initial field investigation with a complementary greenhouse experiment, using soils collected from specific fairy ring zones (inside, ring-edge, outside) to examine plant-soil-microbial interactions under controlled conditions. We selected Leymus chinensis (a dominant grass) as our model plant species to assess the role of diverse fairy ring microbial communities on plant growth and nutrition. Results In our field study, plants on the ring-edge produced greater shoot biomass with higher concentrations of N and P, compared to plants inside the ring or adjacent (outside) controls. Soil microbial community biomarkers indicate shifts in relative microbial biomass as fairy rings expand. Inside the ring, plant roots showed greater damage from pathogenic fungi, compared to outside or ring-edge. Our greenhouse experiment confirmed that inoculation with live ring-edge soil generally promoted plant growth but decreased shoot P concentration. Inoculation with soil collected from inside the ring increased root pathogen infection and reduced shoot biomass. Conclusion We propose that soil microbial activity within ring-edges promotes plant growth via mobilization of plant-available P or directed stimulation. However, as the ring expands, L. chinensis at the leading edge may increase pathogen accumulation, resulting in reduced growth at the center of the ring in subsequent growing seasons. Our results provide new insights into the plant-soil-microbial dynamics of fairy rings in grasslands, helping to elucidate these mysterious vegetation patterns.",Steppe grasslands; Biotic and abiotic factors; Plant-soil-microbial interactions; P-release; Microbial direct stimulation; Pathogen accumulation,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02082-x,NA,12,87,291,2083,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Prevalence of co-infection and genetic diversity of avian haemosporidian parasites in two rehabilitation facilities in Iran: implications for the conservation of captive raptors,"Background: Various haemosporidian parasites infect raptors, especially captive hosts who may be more exposed. Diagnosis of threatening factors such as infectious diseases indirectly has a significant role in protecting endangered or threatened species that may boost the mortality or extinction resulting from declined reproduction. Few investigations have been performed in captive hosts to detect the prevalence of haemosporidian parasites and define genetic diversity in west Asia. For the first time, the current study was designed to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of haemosporidian parasites in captive raptors by molecular methods in two rehabilitation facilities in North and North-east Iran and to define phylogenetic relationships of detected lineages circulating in raptors. Results: Molecular characterization of the haemosporidian parasite was accomplished by PCR-based method and DNA sequencing in 62 captive raptors. The overall prevalence was-36\% with higher infection of Haemoproteus spp. than Leucocytozoon spp. Plasmodium infection was not detected in any host. Results showed that 22 individuals (of 10 species) were infected with unique lineages. Genus Haemoproteus was detected in 26.66\% of examined individuals (of eight species) and Leucocytozoon was found in 10\% of individuals (of four species). The molecular analysis could detect ten lineages (nine Haemoproteus spp. and one Leucocytozoon spp.) which were categorizes as new and six lineages which have been previously detected in the other investigations. Conclusions: The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis derived from obtained data in the present study and published lineages in previous investigations indicated the probable host specificity of Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon parasites in several sub-clades at hosts' order and genus level. As monitoring the parasite loads of captive birds when admitted reduce the risk of infecting hosts in captivity at those locations, we designed this study to determine infection prevalence and genetic diversity of blood parasites in raptors examined in Iran.

BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Population dynamics and demographic history of Eurasian collared lemmings,"Background Ancient DNA studies suggest that Late Pleistocene climatic changes had a significant effect on population dynamics in Arctic species. The Eurasian collared lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus) is a keystone species in the Arctic ecosystem. Earlier studies have indicated that past climatic fluctuations were important drivers of past population dynamics in this species. Results Here, we analysed 59 ancient and 54 modern mitogenomes from across Eurasia, along with one modern nuclear genome. Our results suggest population growth and genetic diversification during the early Late Pleistocene, implying that collared lemmings may have experienced a genetic bottleneck during the warm Eemian interglacial. Furthermore, we find multiple temporally structured mitogenome clades during the Late Pleistocene, consistent with earlier results suggesting a dynamic late glacial population history. Finally, we identify a population in northeastern Siberia that maintained genetic diversity and a constant population size at the end of the Pleistocene, suggesting suitable conditions for collared lemmings in this region during the increasing temperatures associated with the onset of the Holocene. Conclusions This study highlights an influence of past warming, in particular the Eemian interglacial, on the evolutionary history of the collared lemming, along with spatiotemporal population structuring throughout the Late Pleistocene.",Collared lemming; Palaeogenomics; Demographic history; Population structure,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02081-y,NA,9,73,196,1433,4,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Reconstructing the neuromuscular ground pattern of phylactolaemate bryozoans: new data from the Lophopodidae,"Background The solely freshwater inhabiting Phylactolaemata is a sister taxon to all other bryozoans. Among phylactolaemates, Lophopodidae represents an early branching clade that is therefore crucial for ground pattern reconstruction. While more recent morphological data of most phylactolaemate families are present, data of lophopodids are scarce. The genus Asajirella especially, which was previously assigned to the family Pectinatellidae, lacks any detailed analysis with more recent morphological methods. Results This study provides the first morphological analyses of three lophopodid species using serial-sectioning histology and 3D reconstruction, but also immunocytochemical stainings and confocal laserscanning microscopy. There are several lophopodid-specific traits in the nervous system such as the large ganglion with extensive lumen and two prominent protrusions referred to as epistomial horns. The epistome in all lophopodids is rather small and dome-shaped. Contrary to previous reports, we can confirm that duplicature bands insert at the tentacle sheath rather than the diaphragmatic sphincter in all phylactolaemates. The morphology of the digestive tract of lophopodids is identical to other phylactolaemates and possesses exclusively circular muscles. Conclusions Altogether, this study fills significant gaps in our knowledge on phylactolaemate neuromuscular systems and general morphology. It shows that the insertion of the duplicature bands at the tentacle sheath and the circular musculature of the digestive tract to be the ground pattern in phylactolaemates. In addition, we found apomorphic characters for lophopodids such as the dome-shaped epistome with its musculature and the voluminous ganglion with its epistomial horns, which aid in defining and delineating the family.",Myoanatomy; Neuroanatomy; Lophophorata; Lophopus; Lophopodella; Asajirella; 3D reconstruction,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02076-9,NA,13,108,247,1810,7,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,A novel SNP assay reveals increased genetic variability and abundance following translocations to a remnant Allegheny woodrat population,"Background Allegheny woodrats (Neotoma magister) are found in metapopulations distributed throughout the Interior Highlands and Appalachia. Historically these metapopulations persisted as relatively fluid networks, enabling gene flow between subpopulations and recolonization of formerly extirpated regions. However, over the past 45 years, the abundance of Allegheny woodrats has declined throughout the species' range due to a combination of habitat destruction, declining hard mast availability, and roundworm parasitism. In an effort to initiate genetic rescue of a small, genetically depauperate subpopulation in New Jersey, woodrats were translocated from a genetically robust population in Pennsylvania (PA) in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Herein, we assess the efficacy of these translocations to restore genetic diversity within the recipient population. Results We designed a novel 134 single nucleotide polymorphism panel, which was used to genotype the six woodrats translocated from PA and 82 individuals from the NJ population captured before and after the translocation events. These data indicated that a minimum of two translocated individuals successfully produced at least 13 offspring, who reproduced as well. Further, population-wide observed heterozygosity rose substantially following the first set of translocations, reached levels comparable to that of populations in Indiana and Ohio, and remained elevated over the subsequent years. Abundance also increased during the monitoring period, suggesting Pennsylvania translocations initiated genetic rescue of the New Jersey population. Conclusions Our results indicate, encouragingly, that very small numbers of translocated individuals can successfully restore the genetic diversity of a threatened population. Our work also highlights the challenges of managing very small populations, such as when translocated individuals have greater reproductive success relative to residents. Finally, we note that ongoing work with Allegheny woodrats may broadly shape our understanding of genetic rescue within metapopulations and across heterogeneous landscapes.",Reproductive skew; Inbreeding; Genetic restoration; Inbreeding depression; Translocation; Landscape genetics; Dispersal,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02083-w,NA,18,136,285,2120,7,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Polyandrous females but not monogamous females vary in reproductive ageing patterns in the bean bug Riptortus pedestris,"Background In general, reproductive performance exhibits nonlinear changes with age. Specifically, reproductive performance increases early in life, reaches a peak, and then declines later in life. Reproductive ageing patterns can also differ among individuals if they are influenced by individual-specific strategies of resource allocation between early-life reproduction and maintenance. In addition, the social environment, such as the number of available mates, can influence individual-specific resource allocation strategies and consequently alter the extent of individual differences in reproductive ageing patterns. That is, females that interact with more partners are expected to vary their copulation frequency, adopt a more flexible reproductive strategy and exhibit greater individual differences in reproductive ageing patterns. Methods In this study, we evaluated the effect of mating with multiple males on both group- and individual-level reproductive ageing patterns in females of the bean bug Riptortus pedestris by ensuring that females experienced monogamous (one female with one male) or polyandrous conditions (one female with two males). Results We found that group-level reproductive ageing patterns did not differ between monogamy-treatment and polyandry-treatment females. However, polyandry-treatment females exhibited among-individual variation in reproductive ageing patterns, while monogamy-treatment females did not. Conclusion Our findings provide the first empirical evidence regarding the influence of the social environment on individual variation in reproductive ageing patterns. We further suggest that the number of potential mates influences group- and individual-level reproductive ageing patterns, depending on which sex controls mating. We encourage future studies to consider interactions between species-specific mating systems and the social environment when evaluating group- and individual-level reproductive ageing patterns.",Ageing; Monogamy; Polyandry; Life history,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02070-1,NA,17,119,255,1973,4,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Environmental DNA detects Spawning Habitat of an ephemeral migrant fish (Anadromous Rainbow Smelt: Osmerus mordax),"Background Anadromous rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) have experienced a large range reduction in recent decades and the status of remnant spawning populations is poorly known in Maine, where these fish have significant ecological, cultural, and commercial relevance. Defining the remnant range of anadromous smelt is more difficult than for many declining fish species because adults are only ephemerally present while spawning in small coastal streams at night during spring runoff periods when traditional assessments can be unreliable or even hazardous. We hypothesized that eDNA might facilitate improved survey efforts to define smelt spawning habitat, but that detection could also face challenges from adult eDNA quickly flushing out of these small stream systems. We combined daytime eDNA sampling with nighttime fyke netting to ascertain a potential window of eDNA detection before conducting eDNA surveys in four streams of varying abundance. Hierarchical occupancy modeling was in turn employed to estimate eDNA encounter probabilities relative to numbers of sampling events (date), samples within events, and qPCR replicates within samples. Results Results from the combined eDNA and fyke net study indicated eDNA was detectable over an extended period, culminating approximately 8-13 days following peak spawning, suggesting developing smelt larvae might be the primary source of eDNA. Subsequently, smelt eDNA was readily detected in eDNA surveys of four streams, particularly following remediation of PCR inhibitors. Hierarchical occupancy modeling confirmed our surveys had high empirical detection for most sites, and that future surveys employing at least three sampling events, three samples per event, and six qPCR replicates can afford greater than 90\% combined detection capability in low abundance systems. Conclusions These results demonstrate that relatively modest eDNA sampling effort has high capacity to detect this ephemerally present species of concern at low to moderate abundances. As such, smelt eDNA detection could improve range mapping by providing longer survey windows, safer sampling conditions, and lower field effort in low density systems, than afforded by existing visual and netting approaches.",eDNA; Rainbow smelt; Anadromous; Hierarchical occupancy models,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02073-y,NA,15,114,322,2240,4,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Genetic diversity and family groups detected in a coyote population with red wolf ancestry on Galveston Island, Texas","Background Hybridization can be a conservation concern if genomic introgression leads to the loss of an endangered species' unique genome, or when hybrid offspring are sterile or less fit than their parental species. Yet hybridization can also be an adaptive management tool if rare populations are inbred and have reduced genetic variation, and there is the opportunity to enhance genetic variation through hybridization. The red wolf (Canis rufus) is a critically endangered wolf endemic to the eastern United States, where all extant red wolves are descended from 14 founders which has led to elevated levels of inbreeding over time. Red wolves were considered extirpated from the wild by 1980, but before they disappeared, they interbred with encroaching coyotes creating a genetically admixed population of canids along coastal Texas and Louisiana. In 2018, a genetic study identified individuals on Galveston Island, Texas with significant amounts of red wolf ancestry. We collected 203 fecal samples from Galveston for a more in-depth analysis of this population to identify the amount of red wolf ancestry present and potential mechanisms that support retention of red wolf ancestry on the landscape. Results We identified 24 individual coyotes from Galveston Island and 8 from mainland Texas with greater than 10\% red wolf ancestry. Two of those individuals from mainland Texas had greater than 50\% red wolf ancestry estimates. Additionally, this population had 5 private alleles that were absent in the North American reference canid populations used in this study, which included 107 southeastern coyotes, 19 captive red wolves, and 38 gray wolves, possibly representing lost red wolf genetic variation. We also identified several individuals on Galveston Island and the mainland of Texas that retained a unique red wolf mitochondrial haplotype present in the red wolf founding population. On Galveston Island, we identified a minimum of four family groups and found coyotes on the island to be highly related, but not genetically depauperate. We did not find clear associations between red wolf ancestry estimates and landscape features, such as open green space or developed areas. Conclusion Our results confirm the presence of substantial red wolf ancestry persisting on Galveston Island and adjacent mainland Texas. This population has the potential to benefit future red wolf conservation efforts through novel reproductive techniques and possibly through de-introgression strategies, with the goals of recovering extinct red wolf genetic variation and reducing inbreeding within the species.",Coyote; De-introgression; Genetic introgression; Ghost allele; Hybrid; Red wolf,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02084-9,NA,18,117,393,2611,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,yes,no,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Does exclosure restore woody species regeneration in degraded lands? The case of Loma Bosa District of Dawuro zone, Southwestern Ethiopia","Exclosure becomes popular as a naming of the practice of excluding degrading agents from degraded lands for natural rehabilitation. However, its role on woody species regeneration in the Loma Bosa District of the southwestern Ethiopia has not been investigated. Therefore, this study examines the role of exclosure on woody species regeneration by comparing exclosure, open woodland, and degraded land areas. A systematic transect sampling method was employed to collect vegetation data in sampling quadrats, each with a size of 20 x 20 m, evenly distributed along parallel transect lines. All the woody plant species in each plot were identified and measured for DBH and height. Twenty-six woody species, representing 16 plant families, were recorded at the study area, of which only eight were recorded all in the exclosure, open woodland and open degraded land. Species Diversity Index (H `) was 2.62, 2.38, and 1.56 for woody species in exclosure, open woodland area, and open degraded land area. Wood species density were 2225 ha(-1), 1642 ha(-1), and 297 ha(-1) for exclosure, open woodland area, and open degraded land area, respectively. The distribution of the height and DBH of the recorded species in exclosure exhibited an inverted ``J{''} shape pattern suggesting a healthy regeneration status of the important species, while others revealed irregular and less interpretable pattern. Overall results from this study indicated that exclosure is important for improvement of woody species regeneration in degraded lands in the study area.",Exclosure; Loma Bosa District; Open degraded land; Regeneration; Woody species,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02067-w,NA,20,137,238,1549,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Gut microbiota differs between two cold- climate lizards distributed in thermally different regions,"Background The metabolic cold-climate adaption hypothesis predicts that animals from cold environments have relatively high metabolic rates compared with their warm-climate counterparts. However, studies testing this hypothesis are sparse. Here, we compared gut microbes between two cold-climate lizard species of the genus Phrynocephalus to see if gut microbiota could help lizards adapt to cold environments by promoting metabolism. We conducted a 2 species (P. erythrurus and P. przewalskii) x 2 temperatures (24 and 30 degrees C) factorial design experiment, whereby we kept lizards of two Phrynocephalus species at 24 and 30 degrees C for 25 d and then collected their fecal samples to analyze and compare the microbiota based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. Results The gut microbiota was mainly composed of bacteria of the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia in both species (Proteobacteria > Firmicutes >Verrucomicrobiota in P. erythrurus, and Bacteroidetes> Proteobacteria > Firmicutes in P. przewalskii). Further analysis revealed that the gut microbiota promoted thermal adaptation in both lizard species, but with differences in the relative abundance of the contributory bacteria between the two species. An analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes revealed that the gut microbiota played important roles in metabolism, genetic information processing, cellular processes, and environmental information processing in both species. Furthermore, genes related to metabolism were more abundant in P. erythrurus at 24 degrees C than in other species temperature combinations. Conclusion Our study provides evidence that gut microbiota promotes thermal adaptation in both species but more evidently in P. erythrurus using colder habitats than P. przewalskii all year round, thus confirming the role of gut microbiota in cold-climate adaptation in lizards.",16S rRNA gene sequencing; Cold-climate adaptation; Gut microbiota; Phtynocephalus erythrurus; Phrynocephalus przewalskii; Toad-headed lizard,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02077-8,NA,13,99,274,1924,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Insertion/deletion hotspots in the Nsp2, Nsp3, S1, and ORF8 genes of SARS-related coronaviruses","The genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contains many insertions/deletions (indels) from the genomes of other SARS-related coronaviruses. Some of the identified indels have recently reported to involve relatively long segments of 10-300 consecutive bases and with diverse RNA sequences around gaps between virus species, both of which are different characteristics from the classical shorter in-frame indels. These non-classical complex indels have been identified in non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3), the S1 domain of the spike (S), and open reading frame 8 (ORF8). To determine whether the occurrence of these non-classical indels in specific genomic regions is ubiquitous among broad species of SARS-related coronaviruses in different animal hosts, the present study compared SARS-related coronaviruses from humans (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), bats (RaTG13 and Rc-o319), and pangolins (GX-P4L), by performing multiple sequence alignment. As a result, indel hotspots with diverse RNA sequences of different lengths between the viruses were confirmed in the Nsp2 gene (approximately 2500-2600 base positions in the overall 29,900 bases), Nsp3 gene (approximately 3000-3300 and 3800-3900 base positions), N-terminal domain of the spike protein (21,500-22,500 base positions), and ORF8 gene (27,800-28,200 base positions). Abnormally high rate of point mutations and complex indels in these regions suggest that the occurrence of mutations in these hotspots may be selectively neutral or even benefit the survival of the viruses. The presence of such indel hotspots has not been reported in different human SARS-CoV-2 strains in the last 2 years, suggesting a lower rate of indels in human SARS-CoV-2. Future studies to elucidate the mechanisms enabling the frequent development of long and complex indels in specific genomic regions of SARS-related coronaviruses would offer deeper insights into the process of viral evolution.",Bat coronavirus; insertion; deletion (indel); Indel hotspot; Pangolin coronavirus (PCoV); Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02078-7,NA,13,95,280,1959,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Positive selection-driven fixation of a hominin-specific amino acid mutation related to dephosphorylation in IRF9,"The arms race between humans and pathogens drives the evolution of the human genome. It is thus expected that genes from the interferon-regulatory factors family (IRFs), a critical family for anti-viral immune response, should be undergoing episodes of positive selection. Herein, we tested this hypothesis and found multiple lines of evidence for positive selection on the amino acid site Val129 (NP\_006075.3:p.Ser129Val) of human IRF9. Interestingly, the ancestral reconstruction and population distribution analyses revealed that the ancestral state (Ser129) is conserved among mammals, while the derived positively selected state (Val129) was fixed before the ``out-of-Africa{''} event similar to 500,000 years ago. The motif analysis revealed that this young amino acid (Val129) may serve as a dephosphorylation site of IRF9. Structural parallelism between homologous genes further suggested the functional effects underlying the dephosphorylation that may affect the immune activity of IRF9. This study provides a model in which a strong positive Darwinian selection drives a recent fixation of a hominin-specific amino acid leading to molecular adaptation involving dephosphorylation in an immune-responsive gene.",Protein phosphorylation; Positive selection; Purifying selection; Molecular adaptation; IRF9,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02088-5,NA,14,113,170,1221,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Morphospecies and molecular diversity of `lace corals': the genus Reteporella (Bryozoa: Cheilostomatida) in the central North Atlantic Azores Archipelago,"Background As in most bryozoans, taxonomy and systematics of species in the genus Reteporella Busk, 1884 (family Phidoloporidae) has hitherto almost exclusively been based on morphological characters. From the central North Atlantic Azores Archipelago, nine Reteporella species have historically been reported, none of which have as yet been revised. Aiming to characterise the diversity and biogeographic distribution of Azorean Reteporella species, phylogenetic reconstructions were conducted on a dataset of 103 Azorean Reteporella specimens, based on the markers cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1, small and large ribosomal RNA subunits. Morphological identification was based on scanning electron microscopy and complemented the molecular inferences. Results Our results reveal two genetically distinct Azorean Reteporella clades, paraphyletic to eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean taxa. Moreover, an overall concordance between morphological and molecular species can be shown, and the actual bryozoan diversity in the Azores is greater than previously acknowledged as the dataset comprises three historically reported species and four putative new taxa, all of which are likely to be endemic. The inclusion of Mediterranean Reteporella specimens also revealed new species in the Adriatic and Ligurian Sea, whilst the inclusion of additional phidoloporid taxa hints at the non-monophyly of the genus Reteporella. Conclusion Being the first detailed genetic study on the genus Reteporella, the high divergence levels inferred within the genus Reteporella and family Phidoloporidae calls for the need of further revision. Nevertheless, the overall concordance between morphospecies and COI data suggest the potential adequacy of a 3\% cut-off to distinguish Reteporella species. The discovery of new species in the remote Azores Archipelago as well as in the well-studied Mediterranean Sea indicates a general underestimation of bryozoan diversity. This study constitutes yet another example of the importance of integrative taxonomical approaches on understudied taxa, contributing to cataloguing genetic and morphological diversity.",Biodiversity; Biogeography; Integrative taxonomy; Oceanic islands; Phylogeny,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02080-z,NA,19,153,294,2135,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,The evolutionary history and ancestral biogeographic range estimation of old-world Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae (Chiroptera),"Background Family Rhinolophidae (horseshoe bats), Hipposideridae (leaf-nosed bats) and Rhinonycteridae (trident bats) are exclusively distributed in the Old-World, and their biogeography reflects the complex historic geological events throughout the Cenozoic. Here we investigated the origin of these families and unravel the conflicting family origin theories using a high resolution tree covering taxa from each zoogeographic realm from Africa to Australia. Ancestral range estimations were performed using a probabilistic approach implemented in BioGeoBEARS with subset analysis per biogeographic range {[}Old-World as whole, Australia-Oriental-Oceania (AOO) and Afrotropical-Madagascar-Palearctic (AMP)]. Result Our result supports an Oriental origin for Rhinolophidae, whereas Hipposideridae originated from the Oriental and African regions in concordance with fossil evidence of both families. The fossil evidence indicates that Hipposideridae has diversified across Eurasia and the Afro-Arabian region since the Middle Eocene. Meanwhile, Rhinonycteridae (the sister family of Hipposideridae) appears to have originated from the Africa region splitting from the common ancestor with Hipposideridae in Africa. Indomalaya is the center of origin of Rhinolophidae AOO lineages, and Indomalayan + Philippines appears to be center of origin of Hipposideridae AOO lineage indicating allopatric speciation and may have involved jump-dispersal (founder-event) speciation within AOO lineage. Wallacea and the Philippines may have been used as stepping stones for dispersal towards Oceania and Australia from the Oriental region. Multiple colonization events via different routes may have occurred in the Philippines (i.e., Palawan and Wallacea) since the Late Miocene. The colonization of Rhinolophidae towards Africa from Asia coincided with the estimated time of Tethys Ocean closure around the Oligocene to Miocene (around 27 Ma), allowing species to disperse via the Arabian Peninsula. Additionally, the number of potential cryptic species in Rhinolophidae in Southeast Asia may have increased since Plio-Pleistocene and late Miocene. Conclusion Overall, we conclude an Oriental origin for Rhinolophidae, and Oriental + African for Hipposideridae. The result demonstrates that complex historical events, in addition to species specific ecomorphology and specialization of ecological niches may shape current distributions.",Ancestral range; Dispersal; Horseshoe bats; Leafnosed bats; Oriental; Zoogeography,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02066-x,NA,14,128,322,2423,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Complete mitochondrial genomes and updated divergence time of the two freshwater clupeids endemic to Lake Tanganyika (Africa) suggest intralacustrine speciation,"Background The hydrogeological history of Lake Tanganyika paints a complex image of several colonization and adaptive radiation events. The initial basin was formed around 9-12 million years ago (MYA) from the predecessor of the Malagarasi-Congo River and only 5-6 MYA, its sub-basins fused to produce the clear, deep waters of today. Next to the well-known radiations of cichlid fishes, the lake also harbours a modest clade of only two clupeid species, Stolothrissatanganicae and Limnothrissamiodon. They are members of Pellonulini, a tribe of clupeid fishes that mostly occur in freshwater and that colonized West and Central-Africa during a period of high sea levels during the Cenozoic. There is no consensus on the phylogenetic relationships between members of Pellonulini and the timing of the colonization of Lake Tanganyika by clupeids. Results We use short-read next generation sequencing of 10X Chromium libraries to sequence and assemble the full mitochondrial genomes of S.tanganicae and L.miodon. We then use Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference to place them into the phylogeny of Pellonulini and other clupeiforms, taking advantage of all available full mitochondrial clupeiform genomes. We identify Potamothrissaobtusirostris as the closest living relative of the Tanganyika sardines and confirm paraphyly for Microthrissa. We estimate the divergence of the Tanganyika sardines around 3.64 MYA {[}95\% CI: 0.99, 6.29], and from P.obtusirostris around 10.92 MYA {[}95\% CI: 6.37-15.48]. Conclusions These estimates imply that the ancestor of the Tanganyika sardines diverged from a riverine ancestor and entered the proto-lake Tanganyika around the time of its formation from the Malagarasi-Congo River, and diverged into the two extant species at the onset of deep clearwater conditions. Our results prompt a more thorough examination of the relationships within Pellonulini, and the new mitochondrial genomes provide an important resource for the future study of this tribe, e.g. as a reference for species identification, genetic diversity, and macroevolutionary studies.",Great Lakes; Clupeiformes; Mitogenome; Time calibration; Phylogenetics,2022,22,1,10.1186/s12862-022-02085-8,NA,20,160,305,2095,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,Pedal Skeletal Proportions of Bipedal and Potentially Bipedal Dinosaurs and Other Archosaurs: Interpreting the Makers of Early Mesozoic Footprints,"Dinosaur footprints often occur in Late Triassic-Early Jurassic continental sedimentary rocks. While many such tracks can readily be associated with the kinds of dinosaurs that made them, the makers of some footprints have been controversial. Large tridactyl (three-toed) footprints of the ichnogenus Eubrontes are thought by most paleontologists to have been made by theropod dinosaurs, but some workers think their makers were basal sauropodomorph ({''}prosauropod{''}) dinosaurs. The four-toed footprint Otozoum is usually interpreted as a prosauropod print, but some workers instead attribute it to an ornithischian (basal thyreophoran) dinosaur or even a pseudosuchian archosaur. These issues prompted us to do a new study of the proportions of the hindfeet of bipedal and potentially bipedal dinosaurs and other archosaurs, adding new measurements to previously available data. Foot skeletons of theropod dinosaurs differ from those of bipedal ornithischian dinosaurs in having relatively longer phalanges from the middle portions of toes, narrower phalanges, relatively shorter unguals, and a relatively shorter inner toe (digit I-but some members of both groups lose digit I altogether). Theropod feet differ from feet of prosauropods in having slightly narrower phalanges, relatively shorter unguals, and a relatively shorter digit I, but some smaller basal sauropodomorphs are harder to distinguish from theropods in these features. Feet of small to medium-sized ornithischians that retain digit I are very similar to those of most basal sauropodomorphs and also some pseudosuchians. Our results suggest that most (but perhaps not all) morphologically well-preserved Eubrontes are more likely to have been made by theropods than bipedal sauropodomorphs. It is more difficult to determine the most likely maker(s) of Otozoum.",Vertebrate ichnology; Eubrontes; Otozoum; Evazoum,2022,63,2,10.3374/014.063.0201,0079-032X,19,146,264,1834,4,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,The Chelicerae of Slimonia (Eurypterida; Pterygotoidea),"Pterygotid eurypterids are the most speciose eurypterid Glade, accounting for almost a fifth of the approximately 250 known species, although it is unclear whether this increase in diversity is due to their increased dispersal ability, shift in predation style to cheliceral-driven prey capture, or some other factor. Determining if the development of their characteristic large chelicerae represents a key trait facilitating increased diversification is hindered by uncertainty regarding the form of the chelicerae in Slimonia, the sister taxon to Pterygotidae. Here I report the discovery of a specimen of Slimonia acuminata preserving the chelicerae in detail and corroborate reports from the 1800s suggesting that the chelicerae of Slimonia were short and robust. The evidence from the new specimen, taken in concert with the morphology of the rest of the animal, indicates that Slimonia was an active predator that captured prey with its robust prosomal appendages. The apparent increase in pterygotid species diversity therefore does indeed seem to be associated with the development of the large chelicerae; however, further work is needed to determine whether taphonomic biases in preservation due to increased sclerotization of the chelicerae or taxonomic oversplitting due to minor changes in denticle morphology are driving this phenomenon.",Chelicerate; diversity; ecology; eurypterid; feeding; Pterygotidae,2022,63,1,10.3374/014.063.0102,0079-032X,6,55,199,1351,6,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Four previously undescribed eurypterid specimens from the Samuel J. Ciurca Jr. Collection, Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, likely belonging to Eurypterus, and a previously documented specimen of the pterygotid Acutiramus cummingsi in the New York State Museum, are considered here to reinterpret the morphology and homologies of the endostoma. We demonstrate that the endostoma is a bilateral, flaplike appendage, with distal margins bearing anteriorly facing setae. An anterior embayment and posterior medial notch are noted. The latter represents the point where the endostoma articulates with an oval sclerite. Here we propose that, contrary to previous interpretations, the endostoma is an appendage, likely of the seventh body segment, and is probably homologous to the xiphosuran chilaria. This has direct implications for the hypotheses of homology for the metastoma, a ventral structure common to eurypterids and chasmataspids.",Limulus; Euchelicerata; ventral anatomy; metastoma; homology,2022,63,2,10.3374/014.063.0202,0079-032X,10,75,161,1114,5,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,A New Species of Bridled Darter Endemic to the Etowah River System in Georgia (Percidae: Etheostomatinae: Percina),"Percina freemanorum, the Etowah Bridled Darter, is described as a new species endemic to the Etowah River system in Georgia, specifically in Long Swamp Creek, Amicalola Creek, and the upper portion of the Etowah River. The earliest collection records for Percina freemanorum date to 1948 and in 2007 the species was delimited as populations of Percina kusha. Our investigation into the systematics of Percina kusha is motivated by the uncertain status of populations in the Coosawattee River system and observed morphological disparity in several meristic traits between populations in the Conasauga and Etowah River systems. Our analyses of morphological divergence, nuclear genotypes, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype networks confirm the distinctiveness of Percina freemanorum. Morphologically, Percina freemanorum is distinguished from Percina kusha through lower average numbers of lateral line scales (65.4 vs. 72.3); rows of transverse scales (18.0 vs. 21.4); scales around the caudal peduncle (22.1 vs. 24.9); and modally more pectoral fin rays (14 vs. 13). The two species are not reciprocally monophyletic in phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA sequences, but the two species do not share mtDNA haplotypes. Analysis of up to 158,000 double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing loci resolve each of the two species as reciprocally monophyletic and genomic clustering analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms identifies two genetic clusters that correspond to the morphologically delimited Percina freemanorum and Percina kusha.",Teleostei; species delimitation; ddRAD; phylogeography,2021,62,1,10.3374/014.062.0102,0079-032X,17,114,224,1562,4,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

A shift from Plecoptera, Coleoptera, and Ephemeroptera to mainly Ephemeroptera to mainly Trichoptera was observed from the uppermost to the lowermost sites; Chironomidae and Diptera dominated the previously sampled section. High proportions of scrapers in sampled communities on the preserve beginning downstream of the upstream sink system suggested a prevalence of autochthonous detritus over allochthonous detritus at these sites. Macroinvertebrate community compositions and calculated metrics indicated high water quality for sites on the preserve and lower water quality for the agriculturally impacted sites.

We compared two species of Chiropodomys to the similarly sized but terrestrial Mus musculus using quantitative morphometric osteological data recorded from six limb bones. Principal components analysis (PCA) clearly separated Chiropodomys from Mus. Multivariate and univariate analyses revealed several features linked to arboreality in Chiropodomys and characteristics associated with terrestriality in Mus.

BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,"The Geographic Distribution of the Imperiled Barrens Darter, Etheostoma forbesi, and Threats of Hybridization with the Closely Related Fringed Darter, Etheostoma crossopterum","The Barrens Darter, Etheostoma forbesi, is one of the most geographically restricted freshwater fish species in North America, with a distribution limited to headwater portions of nine streams in the western part of the upper Caney Fork, a tributary of the Cumberland River in Tennessee. This limited geographic distribution makes Etheostoma forbesi especially vulnerable to potential threats posed by human alterations to rivers and streams, and the risk of ecological competition and introgressive hybridization with the closely related Fringed Darter, Etheostoma crossopterum. Museum collection records and targeted surveys conducted since its description suggest that present-day range of Etheostoma forbesi does not include several streams it previously inhabitedsome as recently as 15 years ago. We investigate the geographic distribution and variation in meristic traits of both Etheostoma forbesi and Etheostoma crossopterum in the upper Caney Fork system through the examination of all available museum vouchers, and assess phylogeographic patterns among populations using mitochondrial DNA sequence data. We report a newly discovered population of Etheostoma forbesi from the upper Collins River, and present evidence that Etheostoma crossopterum has displaced Etheostoma forbesi in the Hickory Creek system and Mud Creek in the upper Barren Fork River system. There are no differences in scale counts between the two species, but the sum of the number of rays in the anal, pectoral, and second dorsal fins is diagnostic. Analysis of mtDNA variation indicates gene flow between Etheostoma forbesi and Etheostoma crossopterum. Our results suggest that sympatry of the two species in the western upper Caney Fork system is a potential threat to the persistence of Etheostoma forbesi.",Extirpation; endemic species; museum collections; natural history records; Stigmacerca; Caney Fork; Percidae,2020,61,1,10.3374/014.061.0101,0079-032X,22,174,262,1791,7,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,A Review of the Fossil Record of Nonbaenid Turtles of the Clade Paracryptodira,"The fossil record of nonbaenid paracryptodires ranges from the Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) to the Paleocene of North America and Europe only. Earlier remains may be present as early as the Middle Jurassic (Bathonian). Only a single dispersal event is documented between the two continents after their breakup during the Cretaceous in the form of the appearance of the Compsemys lineage in the Paleocene of France. Nonbaenid paracryptodires were restricted to freshwater aquatic environments but display adaptations to diverse feeding strategies consistent with generalist, gape-and-suction, and hypercarnivorous feeding. Current phylogenies recognize two species-rich subclades within Paracryptodira, Baenidae and Pleurosternidae, which jointly form the clade Baenoidea.

BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,Are Geckos Paratenic Hosts for Caribbean Island Acanthocephalans? Evidence from Gonatodes antillensis and a Global Review of Squamate Reptiles Acting as Transport Hosts,"It is well known that reptiles can act as paratenic hosts for parasites that use mammals as their definitive hosts. However, studies of potential paratenic hosts in the Caribbean have been temporally restricted to only diurnal species of lizards, thereby neglecting a dominant component of the nocturnal reptilian community: geckos. Many gecko species are human commensals with activity periods that overlap temporally with those of domestic cats, making them prime candidates as potential transport hosts for cat parasites. However, no studies have reported geckos as paratenic hosts for fetid parasites on any Caribbean island. Here we report the first records of subcutaneous oligacanthorhynchid cystacanths on the Venezuelan Coastal Clawed Gecko (Gonatodes antillensis) based on specimens collected in Curacao and Bonaire. The cysts were identified as belonging to the genus Oncicola, likely those of Oncicola venezuelensis. This study reports these geckos as a new host record for oligacanthorhynchid cystacanths, as well as Curacao and Bonaire as new geographic locales for these acanthocephalan parasites. We additionally provide a review of saurian cystacanths, comparing the restricted taxonomic focus of transport hosts in Caribbean islands to the distribution of paratenic squamate hosts both in the Neotropics and globally. We find evidence that the ability of squamate reptiles to act as transport hosts is a pervasive feature across their Tree of Life, suggesting that these animals may serve as important vectors for transporting parasites between intermediate and definitive hosts.",Acanthocephala; intestinal helminths; cats; parasite; trophic transmission; mammals; birds; host-parasite interactions; vector species,2019,60,1,10.3374/014.060.0103,0079-032X,23,168,234,1597,9,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,"Chronostratigraphic Revision of the Cloverly Formation (Lower Cretaceous, Western Interior, USA)","The Cloverly Formation is an important geologic unit for understanding the development of North American terrestrial landscapes and ecosystems, but the age of this unit is poorly constrained. We report U-Pb radiometric dates determined by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and chemical abrasion thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS) from euhedral zircons derived from fluvial sandstone and bentonitic claystone. We reanalyzed published biostratigraphic, paleomagnetic, and radiometric datasets, which have generally disregarded younger (late Albian-Cenomanian) ages for the formation. New data reported in this study suggest that deposition of the Cloverly Formation spanned the Valanginian-Cenomanian stages (ca. 140 Ma-98 Ma), a longer time interval than the commonly cited Aptian-Albian depositional timeframe. The lowest member of the Cloverly Formation, the Pryor Conglomerate, was deposited ca. 140-130 Ma in response to the onset of the Sevier Orogeny shedding sediment from the west. The overlying Little Sheep Mudstone Member was deposited ca. 124-109 Ma in a time of low sediment supply. In the mid-late Albian to early Cenomanian (ca. 109-98 Ma), sediment sourced from the east was deposited as the Himes Member and Greybull Sandstone. Following this, the Sykes Mountain Formation began nearshore deposition as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed from the north. Our revised chronostratigraphic framework for the Cloverly Formation is congruent with tectonic subsidence analysis showing a rapid increase in accommodation space in the mid-Albian. We hypothesize that more intensive sampling may yield multiple fossil assemblages withal the formation, paralleling its correlates to the south.

BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,First Record of a Small Juvenile Giant Crocodyliform and Its Ontogenetic and Biogeographic Implications,"Deinosuchus is a genus of large crocodylian that inhabited North America during the Late Cretaceous. This massive predator has become one of the most well-known prehistoric organisms, with a considerable amount of literature on its biogeography, ecology, and evolution published. However, ontogenetic changes of Deinosuchus and other species of extinct large, predatory crocodyliforms have remained poorly understood because of a lack of remains known from juvenile individuals and issues surrounding the ability of histological analysis of adult material to provide information on yearly growth. Here, I describe a tooth from a juvenile Deinosuchus estimated at less than 1 m in total body length. As the first reported specimen of a juvenile Deinosuchus, to the author's knowledge, in the literature, the new fossil evinces the extremely small size of young individuals of this taxon compared to adults more than 8 m and 3,500 kg. Furthermore, the tooth shows that some morphological discrepancies existed between the dentition of juvenile and adult Deinosuchus individuals, including the size of the nutritive region. In addition to being the first specimen of Deinosuchus from northeastern North America described in detail, the tooth emphasizes the biological extremes of attaining large body size in Deinosuchus and may add support to the hypothesis that the ontogeny of gigantic crocodyliforms was characterized by extended periods of juvenile growth.",Deinosuchus; Cretaceous; Ellisdale; Crocodylia,2019,60,1,10.3374/014.060.0104,0079-032X,14,103,218,1458,4,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY,Insights from Nondestructive Geochemical Analyses of Hacienda Grande (Puerto Rico) and Salt River (Virgin Islands) Saladoid and Ostionoid Ceramics,"After decades of archaeological excavations, legacy collections present us with vast reservoirs of untapped research potential. By studying Ceramic Age (ca. 500 BC-AD 600) Caribbean pottery from Hacienda Grande (Puerto Rico) and Salt River (St. Croix), this exploratory study devised a method for the use of nondestructive geochemical analyses (portable X-ray fluorescence) on large ceramic collections to research various aspects of cultural interaction, such as trade, exchange, social networks, and mobility. A set of ceramic information was divided into multiple variables to test the geochemical data for patterns of variability due to vessel use, production techniques, or provenance of raw materials. The results indicate that the potters from Hacienda Grande most likely used only one local clay source, but applied different production and finishing techniques in relation to the vessel function; whereas, the ceramics found in Salt River indicate at least two clay sources or different tempers, yet little variation in finishing techniques. The results obtained in this study support the image of self-sufficient communities that maintained a close source-to-site distance in ceramic production and consumption. Furthermore, the observed similarities between islands point to a shared cultural package as the result of knowledge transmission through interaction, rather than transportation of pottery between sites and islands.",Caribbean archaeology; cultural interaction; ceramic practice; geochemistry; legacy collection,2019,60,2,10.3374/014.060.0201,0079-032X,19,146,205,1437,5,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY,Adsorptive-desorptive performance of Chlorella vulgaris for the removal of vanadium from aqueous solutions,"Studies on Vanadium (V) adsorption in aqueous systems employing biomaterials friendly to the environment are rare. This study investigated the adsorption performance of the living and non-living Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) for V from aquatic systems. Vanadium inhibited the growth of living C. vulgaris. The results of isothermal equations showed that the non-living C. vulgaris biomass was favourable for V adsorption. At 400 mg L-1 V, 50 mg algae biomass, 40 degrees C, and 0.01 M ionic strength for 24 h, the maximum adsorption capacity reached 94.00 mg g(-1). The results of the kinetic studies indicated that chemisorption dominated the V adsorption process. Analysis on the surface of non-living C. vulgaris biomass revealed that hydroxyl groups, carboxylate groups, amide groups, aromatic carbons, and organic halogenated hydrocarbon groups played crucial roles in V biosorption. Vanadium was bound to the active sites on the surface of C. vulgaris through ion exchange action as opposed to redox reaction. Desorption experiments were conducted by eluting the non-living C. vulgaris biomass with 1 M NaOH solution, and the maximum desorption rate of V reached 98\%.

Ten trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Ti, V and Zn) concentrations and Pb-206/Pb-207 and Pb-208/Pb-207 isotopic ratios were analyzed by ICP-MS in four lichen species: Xanthoria Parietina, Ramalina Lacera, Xanthoria Calcicola and Ramalina Pollinaria. The results showed significant differences among study sites for most elements with higher concentrations in the industrial, urban and peri-urban sites compared to the reference site chosen as a natural rural area far from any human activities. Significant differences were found between saxicolous and corticolous species especially for Cd, Cu and Zn. The values of Zn/Cu, Zn/Pb and Pb isotope ratios measured in lichens revealed that vehicular traffic and industrial emissions are the main sources of atmospheric Pb contamination. Other anthropic activities (waste incineration, artisanal pottery horizontal ellipsis ) might be the source of other trace metal elements accumulated by lichens.

The targeted genes include the Multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) and Copper-transporting ATPase-RAN1 (RAN1). P. resinosa seedlings were treated with different concentrations of copper sulphate and corresponding salt controls in growth chamber screening tests. These concentrations include 13, 130 mg and 1300 mg of copper per 1 kg of dry soil. Potassium sulfate and water were used as controls. The expression of MRP4 and RANI genes was assessed using RT-qPCR. All the genotypes tested were resistant to copper. There was a significant suppression of the MRP4 and RANI genes at the lowest concentration of copper (13 mg/kg) in comparison to the water control. Further increases in the copper concentrations (130 mg /kg and 1300 mg/kg) did not induce any significant change in gene expression.

This also investigates the phytoremediation capacity of the mangrove species in the forestation areas. The result showed that significantly (P < 0.05) higher amount of organic carbon in the mangrove forestation sediments than lagoon sediments. Mangrove forestation increased the accumulation of Cr, Mn, Cu, As, and Zn in the mangrove sediments than lagoon sediments. According to chemical speciation, it revealed that acid-soluble fraction decreased and oxidisable fraction increased in the mangrove sediments than lagoon sediments. Cu, Ni, Cr, and As has considerably increased in oxidisable fraction, and Cd and Pb have increased in the reducible fraction in the mangrove sediment. The bio-concentration factor and translocation factor values indicate that these species of mangroves are not efficient accumulators of heavy metals from the surrounding environment but potential metals translocators.

At present, few studies assessed its effect on the nervous system of zebrafish, especially its sub-chronic toxicity on the zebrafish brain. In this study, the sub-chronic toxicity of broflanilide on the zebrafish brain was assessed.

Overall, these changes result in brain cell apoptosis, and inhibited growth and development. Moreover, broflanilide affects the release of acetylcholinesterase, gamma-aminobutyric acid, 5-hydroxy tryptamine, and dopamine as well as the expression of related genes in the brain, leading to abnormal zebrafish behaviour.

CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY,"Biogeochemistry of sedimentary phosphorus species in the world's longest river on an Island, the Kapuas River (West Kalimantan, Indonesia)","In this study, surface sediments along the mainstream of the Kapuas River were determined for sedimentary phosphorus (P) species, which include exchangeable-P (Ex-P), iron-bound P (Fe-P), apatite P (Ca-P), detrital P (De-P), and organic P (OP). The objective of this study was to determine the dynamics of sedimentary P species in the world's longest river on an island. The results showed that the composition of sedimentary P species of the river to total P (TP) was in this order: Ca-P (57\% of TP) > Ex-P (21\%) > Fe-P (11\%) > OP (6\%) > De-P (5\%). As the bioavailable P (BAP), which includes Ex-P, Fe-P, and OP, represents around 38\% of TP, this could indicate the river sediments' potential to release P. The sedimentary BAP showed an overall decreasing trend from the upper river to downstream of the river. In contrast, Ca-P showed an increasing trend from the upper river to downstream of the river. All these indicate the dynamics of a localised P cycle along a river, as the BAP released to the overlying water could contribute to Ca-P formation.",Decomposition; phosphorus species; sediments; tropical river,2022,38,8,10.1080/02757540.2022.2117309,0275-7540,19,138,180,1060,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY,Biosorption of copper (II) from aqueous solutions by raw and chemically modified Thymus pannonicus in batch and fixed-bed systems,"In this study, the Cu(II) biosorption potential of the raw (RTP) and modified Thymus pannonicus (MTP) leaves was investigated in batch and continuous systems. FTIR, SEM, SEM-EDX and Zeta potential analyses were used for the characterisation of biomass. In the batch system, pH, amount of biosorbent, initial heavy metal concentration, contact time and temperature parameters were studied. According to the optimum pH and biosorbent amount determined in the batch system, the effect of the flow rate and column bed height on the biosorption was investigated by MTP in the continuous mode. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were used to explain the biosorption mechanism, and it was seen that both biomasses conformed to the Langmuir isotherm. Pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models were used in kinetic studies, and both RTP and MTP followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. While the equilibrium was established in 20 min in the removal of Cu(II) with RTP, this value increased to 30 min with MTP. The maximum monolayer biosorption capacity was determined as 46.21 mg/g for RTP and 82.70 mg/g for MTP. Column studies showed that the MTP was successful in removing Cu(II) from the solution in the continuous system.",Biosorption; Thymus pannonicus; copper (II); isotherms; fixed bed,2022,38,5,10.1080/02757540.2022.2084085,0275-7540,19,129,193,1245,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY,Chlorella-Daphnia consortium as a promising tool for bioremediation of Nile tilapia farming wastewater,"The objective of this study was to investigate the effluent treatment from Nile tilapia farming in a biofloc system with a consortium of microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) and zooplankton (Daphnia similis). Thus, integrated cultures of C. vulgaris and D. similis were performed in two forms of wastewater treatment: sedimentation (S) and non-sedimentation (NS), in four different salinities (1, 2, 3 and 4 g L-1). Water quality, growth of D. similis, behaviour of C. vulgaris, efficiency of removal of nitrogen compounds, orthophosphate, and total suspended solids (TSS) were measured. D. similis had higher density in 3NS (p < 0.05), while population die-off occurred in 4S and 4NS. The 2S and 1NS combinations stood out in bioremediation, achieving removal of up to 70.37\% nitrate, 75.74\% orthophosphate, and 90.74\% TSS. 2S and 3S cultures became self-sufficient from day 21. Thus, the Chlorella-Daphnia consortium using 3NS allowed better production of D. similis, whereas salinities 2 g L-1 (S) and 1 g L-1 (NS) provided better bioremediation, and the use of S wastewater improved the sustainability of the system.

CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY,Co-precipitation synthesis of non-cytotoxic and magnetic cobalt ferrite nanoparticles for purging heavy metal from the aqueous medium: Pb(II) adsorption isotherms and kinetics study,"Owing to unique physical and chemical properties, nanostructured magnetic materials have proved their efficacy in treating heavy metals from the aqueous system. In this study, oleic acid-coated cobalt ferrite is synthesised by the co-precipitation method for the remediation of Pb(II) ions from an aqueous solution. The synthesised CoFe2O4@OA was characterised by various analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The non-cytotoxic behaviour of CoFe2O4@OA suggests it a risk-free adsorbent for the aquatic environment. The mechanism of adsorption reveals that electrostatic interaction, inner-sphere complex formation within Pb(II) ions and CoFe2O4@OA are responsible for the removal. The kinetics experiment followed the pseudo-second-order model with a regression coefficient (R-2) of 0.999. In the isothermal study, equilibrium data were well tuned with the Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 16.7 mg g(-1). The desorption experiment with a series of acid (HCl, HNO3) and alkali (NaOH, KOH) solvents informs the high dependency of desorption efficiency on the solvent type and concentration. Pb(II) ions removal efficiency using 0.5M HCL and 0.6M NaOH was attainted 98\% and 82\%, respectively, after three cycles.

This study selected saline - alkaline abandoned farmland as a control (0a), and cotton fields were continuously planted for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years after reclamation. The results showed that the lowest soil electrical conductivity and total nitrogen are found in 0a, the highest pH (5a) and Available potassium content are found in 0a. SOC and humus contents were significantly increased by reclamation, which showed a trend of first increase and then decrease, and the highest value was observed in continuous cropping cotton 10a. In addition, the SOM is basically aliphatic. When the cotton field was continuously planted for 15a. Alkyl C: O-alkyl C and hydrophobicity index were the highest, indicating that the alkylation degree of SOM was high, the decomposition ability was strong, and the stability was improved.

CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY,Distribution and removal of antibiotic resistance genes in a landfill leachate treatment process,"Domestic waste landfills have been regarded as the main source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) which are considered to be emerging environmental contaminants. Fluorescent quantitative PCR detection was used to determine the occurrence and abundance of ARGs in a landfill leachate treatment system. Fourteen ARGs were detected initially in the leachate influents. The most abundant ARGs were IntI1, followed by sulI, sulII, sulIII, tetC and tetW. The abundance of ARGs increased in the biological treatment unit and then decreased in the effluent of ultrafiltration membrane treatment. The absolute abundance of ARGs in effluent was 1.05-1.94 orders of magnitude lower than that in influent. There was a very significant strong correlation between various ARGs and heavy metals, especially Zn, Pb, Cu, Cd and As, indicating that there may be obvious co-selection between heavy metals and ARGs. Although the leachate treatment process could effectively reduce the abundance of ARGs, its effect on reducing the number of species of ARGs was relatively limited, which may have potential environmental health risks to the urban sewage plant receiving leachate effluent and the final receiving water body.",Antibiotic resistance genes; leachate treatment process; distribution; removal; heavy metal; municipal solid waste,2022,38,10,10.1080/02757540.2022.2129624,0275-7540,13,96,181,1205,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY,Effect of CaO and SO2 on the distribution of arsenic species during coal combustion at high temperature,"Arsenic emission from coal combustion is of great concern due to its high toxicity and ecological environment hazards. Toxicity of arsenic is related to its speciation. Effects of CaO and SO2 on arsenic emission during SH and HLH coal combustion at high temperature were obtained through thermodynamic calculation. It indicates that the volatilisation ratio of arsenic in the form of As4O6 (g) increases as the combustion temperature increasing. Coal type and content of CaO significantly affect the transition temperature of arsenic volatilisation. During SH combustion, with the addition of 10 wt \% CaO, the inhibition rate of arsenic volatilisation is gradually increased to its maximum value of 30.46\% at 900 degrees C. The transition temperature of arsenic volatilisation is 1100 degrees C and the inhibition rate is 42.74\% with 20 wt \% CaO added. As for HLH, either 10 wt \% or 20 wt \% CaO is added, the transition temperature are both 1200 degrees C, with the inhibition rate of 36.46\% and 48.37\%, respectively. Moreover, competition is existed between SO2 and arsenic during coal combustion.

Fingerlings of Nile tilapia (3.15 +/- 0.5 g) were cultured for 70 days in a randomised design with two application rates: 30\% and 50\% molasses application of the total daily feed. Chlorella vulgaris was supplemented every 5 days (5 x 10(4) cells mL(-1)) and plankton samples were collected weekly. Evaluating planktonic data, diversity was considered low, and there was no significant difference (p < 0.05) between liquid molasses application rates. However, in the analysis of similarities, a difference was observed in relation to time. Cluster analysis identified two groups for phytoplankton and zooplankton. Chlorophyta group was the most abundant (>40\%), with Chlorella genus being the main responsible for this dominance. In the zooplankton and protozooplankton communities, the genera with the highest abundance were: Anuraeopsis (42.60-76.96\%) and Paramecium (70.15-81.25\%), respectively. For zootechnical performance, the treatment with molasses application rates of 30\% showed lower feed conversion ratio (2.06 +/- 0.17).

CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY,Effects of sublethal concentrations of cypermethrin on the gills of Lake Van Fish (Alburnus tarichi),"Cypermethrin is one of the most commonly used pesticides in the Lake Van Basin of Turkey. In this study, the effects of a sublethal dose (0.05 mu g/L) of cypermethrin for 96 h on the gills of Lake Van fish (Alburnus tarichi), the only vertebrate species living in Lake Van, were investigated. Levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), Na,K-ATPase, and DNA damage (8-OHdG) were determined immunohistochemically in the gills. In addition, changes in gill mucous cells and histopathological changes in gill tissues after 96 h were investigated. At the end of the cypermethrin administration, an increase was observed in the numbers of mitochondria-rich cells, HSP70-positive cells, and 8-OHdG-positive cells in the gills. A decrease in both the number and volume of mucous cells was detected. The expansion of blood vessels, aneurysms, lamellar lifting, hypertrophy, lamellar fusion, and necrosis were observed in gill tissues.

The pollution of land-uses soils in ancient Pundranagar, Bangladesh arouses growing interest because of severe anthropogenic stress, urbanization, ecotourism, overexploitation of natural resources, and discharges of industrial as well as municipal waste. Our study unfolds the extent of heavy metal pollution in the land-uses surface soil of this ancient terrestrial ecosystem and also investigates the contamination status, source, and ecological risks using pollution indices techniques. Total 90 soil samples were collected from six different land-uses and heavy metals were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer.

The aim of the present study was to isolate hydrocarbon-utilising and metal-tolerant bacteria capable of hydrocarbon degradation and metal remediation. Petroleum contaminated soil from which the bacteria were isolated had a total hydrocarbon concentration of 3538 mg/kg and several metals. The soil was also observed for the total bacterial population which was observed as 2.23 x 10(6) CFU/g of soil. Among different strains, strain YSA-9 showed the highest potential for hydrocarbon-utilisation with an absorbance of 0.920.

Soils were taken in the industrial area of El Hadjar (NE-Algeria) at 0-10 and 10-20 cm. The results revealed an order of Fe > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cr, whatever the depth. Mean concentrations of Fe, Zn, Pb, Cu and Cr were 31191, 219.87, 96.76, 47.87, 28.27 mu g/g, respectively, at 0-10 cm, and 29,792, 304.09, 115.45, 49.08, 28.16 mu g/g, at 10-20 cm.

These allelochemicals were isolated from Thapsia garganica leaves methanolic extract. Experiments were carried out by irrigation and spray in pot trials. Each compound was tested at the concentration that inhibits 50\% of L. perenne root growth (IC50). Mixtures were prepared at the total concentration determined to inhibit 50\% of weed root growth based upon the IC50 value for each compound (1000 mu M, 154 mu M and 300 mu M for 1, 2 and 3, respectively). The greatest herbicidal effect was observed in tertiary mixtures, followed by binary ones, and single compounds showed the lowest phytotoxicity. Moreover, spray treatment was more effective at inhibiting growth of L. perenne, compared with irrigation. For sprayed binary mixtures, the 2 and 3 mixture showed the best inhibitions in shoot (75.79\%) and root (91.02\%) growth, and fresh weight (89.28\%). These values significantly improved those of the most active single compound, 1 (48.01\%, 58.62\% and 57.14\%, respectively, following spray). On the other hand, compound 3, whose structure is related to guaianolide sesquiterpene lactones, was a common constituent of the most active mixtures, suggesting that it plays a more relevant role in the improvement of the phytotoxicity of mixtures. Results obtained for the spray treatment of the tertiary mixture of 1 (333.33 mu M), 2 (51.33 mu M) and 3 (100 mu M) were even more prominent, since weed growth was completely inhibited. After irrigation with a tertiary mixture, the greatest inhibitions in shoot and root growth and fresh weight did not exceed 88.16\%, 94\% and 90.47\%, respectively.

CHEMOECOLOGY,"Biogeochemical cycling of nickel and nutrients in a natural high-density stand of the hyperaccumulator Phyllanthus rufuschaneyi in Sabah, Malaysia","The extend of biogeochemical cycling of nickel (Ni) by tropical hyperaccumulator plants in their native habitat is largely unknown, although these unusual plants are suspected to play a major role in the recycling of this element in ultramafic ecosystems. In this study, we have assessed the biogeochemical cycling of Ni (and other elements, including mineral nutrients) by a tropical Ni hyperaccumulator plant, i.e., Phyllanthus rufuschaneyi, which is one of the most promising species for tropical Ni agromining. The study site was a young secondary forest in Sabah (Malaysia) where Phyllanthus rufuschaneyi occurs as the dominant species on an ultramafic Cambisol. For 2 years, we monitored a 100-m(2) plot and collected information on weather, biomass increase, soil fertility, water fluxes to the soil and litter fluxes for a wide range of elements, including Ni. The Ni cycle is mainly driven by internal fluxes, notably the degradation and recycling of Ni-rich litter. Over the period of investigation, the Ni litter flux corresponded to the total Ni stock of the litter (5.2 g m(-2) year(-1)). The results further show that Ni turnover varies significantly with the accumulation properties of the plant cover. This points to the major influence of Ni hyperaccumulator plants in building up Ni available stocks in the topsoils, as has also been shown in temperate ultramafic systems. Litterfall and throughfall contribute substantially to the cycling of phosphorus, sulphur and potassium in this ecosystem, with throughfall contributing 2-, 220- and 20-fold higher to the respective nutrient fluxes relative to litterfall. The magnesium:calcium ratio far exceeded 1 in the soil, but was < 1 in the leaves of Phyllanthus rufuschaneyi. The insights from this study should be taken into account when designing tropical agromining operations; as Ni stocks could be more labile than initially thought. The removal of Ni- and nutrients-rich biomass will likely affect available Ni (and major nutrients) for the next cropping seasons, and requires sustainable fertilisation, to be utilized to replenish depleted major nutrients. These findings also have major ecological implications.",Biogeochemistry; Litter; Nickel hyperaccumulator plants; Nutrient cycling; Southeast Asia; Ultramafic soils,2022,32,1,10.1007/s00049-021-00363-3,0937-7409,19,146,332,2184,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
CHEMOECOLOGY,Colonial chemical signature of social wasps and their nesting substrates,"Social wasps build their nests using plant material and can thereby occupy different types of habitats. The organization of their colonies is generally based on complex communication systems that include chemical compounds of the cuticle that are shared with the material of their nests thus contributing to the specific chemical signature of their colony. These compounds can vary by environmental factors, in this case the nesting substrate may interfere with this composition. However, no study to date has investigated whether there is any relationship between the chemical signature of the colony and the nesting substrate of their nests. Therefore, in this study we investigated the relationship between the colonial chemical signature and the plant in which the colonies were nesting.

CHEMOECOLOGY,"Electrophysiological and behavioral activities of sex pheromone and structurally related compounds in lightbrown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana","Species-specific pheromone communication in moths is often achieved by the precise control of the production of a multi-component sex pheromone blend in females and selective perception of pheromone compounds in males. Reproductive isolation mediated by sex pheromone can be enhanced by the sensitive detection of structurally related non-pheromone components that are not used as pheromone in the same species but used as pheromone components in similar species. Here, we identified several unsaturated aliphatic acetates inhibiting the attraction of male moths to conspecific female sex pheromone in the lightbrown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), through electroantennogram (EAG) and field trapping studies. In EAG screening with 46 pheromone and structurally related compounds, eleven compounds exhibited significant male-specific EAG responses at 1 mu g dose. The EAG-active compounds were mainly mono- or di-unsaturated 14-carbon acetates. In subsequent field trapping tests to evaluate the behavioral activities of the EAG-active compounds on male attraction to the binary blend (E11-14:Ac + E9E11-14:Ac) of female sex pheromone of E. postvittana, each of nine compounds (E9-12:Ac, Z9-12:Ac, E9-14:Ac, Z9-14:Ac, Z10-14:Ac, Z11-14:Ac, Z12-14:Ac, Z9E11-14:Ac and Z9E12-14:Ac) displayed clear inhibition of male moths to the sex pheromone blend in a dose-dependent manner.

CHEMOECOLOGY,Fate of carotenoids in the closed living system of gall-gall wasp-parasitoid,"Carotenoids play multiple roles in insects, including coloration and protection. Most insects can obtain carotenoids only from their diet. Therefore, carotenoids are proposed to reflect trophic chains and lifestyles of insects. We investigated the mini-ecosystem of a gall on a hawkweed Hieracium x robustum induced by the gall wasp Aulacidea hieracii (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) that is attacked by parasitoid wasp Eurytoma cynipsea (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae). The parasitoid larvae consume the gall wasp larvae that consume the gall tissues. We employed resonance Raman spectroscopy to trace the fate of carotenoids in living larvae and pupae of these insects. We showed that carotenoid composition in the parasitoid closely corresponds to that of its diet-the gall wasp. On the contrary, carotenoid composition in the gall wasp was independent of that in the gall tissues, and the carotenoid concentration increases as non-feeding larvae mature. Thus, A. hieracii is suggested as a candidate among insects to have the ability to synthesize and modify carotenoids. Our findings give rise to the question of the relevance of using carotenoids as markers of trophic flow in the gall community.",Gall wasps; Aulacidea hieracii; Cynipidae; Eurytoma cynipsea; Carotenoids; Raman spectroscopy,2022,32,1,10.1007/s00049-021-00364-2,0937-7409,11,76,179,1190,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
CHEMOECOLOGY,Host-plant volatiles enhance the attraction of Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) to sex pheromone,"Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a notorious pest of rice, Oryza sativa L. (Poaceae). Sex pheromones and host-plant volatiles can trap C. medinalis separately. To improve the trap efficiency of synthetic sex pheromone blend, we first tested the synergistic effect of 8 host-plant volatiles, including 2-phenylethanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, octanal, valeraldehyde, and methyl salicylate, on the attraction of C. medinalis to the female-produced sex pheromones in electroantennography. The addition of (E)-2-hexenal, methyl salicylate, valeraldehyde, and (Z)-3-hexenal increased electroantennogram response of C. medinalis to sex pheromones. Further behavioral testing in wind tunnel experiments indicated that additive (E)-2-hexenal or methyl salicylate stimulated the landing behaviors of both male and female C. medinalis compared with sex pheromones alone. Field evaluations showed that mixtures of sex pheromones and (E)-2-hexenal /methyl salicylate resulted in significantly higher catches to male moths than sex pheromones alone. Using 1:1 and 1:10 combinations of the sex pheromones and (E)-2-hexenal, the attraction of C. medinalis to mixtures showed a synergistic effect of 95\% and 110\%, respectively. Furthermore, 1:1 and 1:10 mixtures of the sex pheromones and methyl salicylate exhibited a synergistic effect of 69\% and 146\%, respectively.

CHEMOECOLOGY,Juvenile hormone regulates reproductive physiology and the production of fertility cues in the swarm-founding wasp Polybia occidentalis,"Juvenile hormone (JH) has important functions that regulate insect life. In adult individuals, it induces gonadotropic and behavioral changes. Manipulating JH levels helps to understand how it influences insect physiology. The effects of JH on Epiponini swarm-founding wasps have shown contrasting results, affecting reproduction, chemical compound expression, behavior, and age polyethism. In this study, we investigated whether JH affects reproductive physiology and production of fertility cues in a swarm-founding wasp species Polybia occidentalis in an age-controlled experimental setup. We treated newly emerged females with methoprene (JH analogue) and precocene-I (JH inhibitor) to determine their effects on ovary activation and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) expression. Furthermore, we compared the chemical profiles of treated workers with those of queens. Our results show that methoprene and precocene-I affected the CHC production in P. occidentalis. Additionally, females treated with methoprene were chemically more similar to queens than precocene- and acetone-treated females. Methoprene affected ovarian status (increasing ovary activation). These results suggest that different levels of JH reflect changes in chemical and reproductive traits in P. occidentalis females. Furthermore, we point out the existence of fertility cues in this Epiponini wasp.",Epiponini wasp; Hormonal treatment; Methoprene; Precocene,2022,32,4-May,10.1007/s00049-022-00376-6,0937-7409,17,135,185,1370,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
CHEMOECOLOGY,Reproduction and fertility signalling under joint juvenile hormone control in primitively eusocial Mischocyttarus wasps,"Juvenile hormone (JH) is a key insect hormone involved in the regulation of physiological, developmental and behavioural processes. In social insects, it has been shown that JH can play a key role in modulating reproductive division of labour, age-related division of labour and chemical signalling, and can display marked changes in function of the degree of sociality. Here, we checked the effects of JH on reproduction in single foundresses of two neotropical primitively eusocial wasp species, Mischocyttarus cerberus and Mischocyttarus cassununga, by examining how treatments with the JH-analogue methoprene and the anti-JH precocene affect egg-laying, ovarian activation and chemical profiles. Our hypothesis was that reproduction and the production of particular fertility-linked cuticular hydrocarbon cues might be under shared JH control already in primitively eusocial wasp species, and this could have been a key enabler to allow such cues to later evolve into full-fledged queen pheromone signals in advanced eusocial species. In line with this hypothesis, we show that our hormone treatments significantly affected both egg laying and the production of particular hydrocarbons present on the egg surface. We discuss the relevance of these findings in the context of the evolution of social insect queen pheromones in advanced eusocial species with a morphologically differentiated queen-worker caste.",Juvenile hormone; Reproduction; Cuticular hydrocarbons; Primitively eusocial wasps; Mischocyttarus,2022,32,3,10.1007/s00049-022-00370-y,0937-7409,14,119,205,1413,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

In the course of testing the attractiveness of tC and N3MBA to Vespidae using Rescue(R) Wasp TrapStiks, a significant number of female milichiids, Desmometopa nearctica Sabrosky and D. sordida (Fallen) (Diptera: Milichiidae) were trapped as well. However, the attraction of vespid wasps was not significant at the dosages tested. We found a significant synergistic effect of tC and N3MBA in attracting Desmometopa flies. Both D. nearctica and D. sordida are kleptoparasitic species; and we conclude that females of these two milichiid flies use tC and N3MBA (and likely other volatiles) released from venom glands of the social vespids (yellowjackets, paper wasps and hornets) as kairomones to locate disturbed, injured, or freshly killed insects (vespids and/or their prey) as a protein-rich food source for egg development and production.",Vespidae; Kairomone; Spiroacetal; Acetamide; Sticky trap,2022,32,2,10.1007/s00049-021-00365-1,0937-7409,17,169,150,1066,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

CHEMOECOLOGY,3D-printed insect models offer a feasible method for mating studies of chrysomelid beetles,"A variety of models have been used in mating bioassays of insects to assess the contribution of chemical and visual signals to mate location and mate selection. Although the use of such `dummies' has had varying degrees of success, some insect species refuse to accept simplistic models. In the present study, we developed a 3D-printed model to explore whether more realistic models will be more successful than simplistic models in mating assays of difficult to manipulate species such as the flea beetle Altica fragariae. We ran five experiments to test (1) whether males could discriminate between males and females solely based on differences in cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), (2) whether males use shape or (3) color to choose mates, and (4) whether males can discriminate between 3D-printed models and freshly killed beetles either with or (5) without legs and antennae. The results of these experiments confirmed that male A. fragariae preferred models coated with CHCs of females over that of male CHCs, providing strong support for the role of CHCs in mate choice in Altica. We also showed that males use both shape and color in mate selection, and that males are capable of discriminating between the models and real beetle specimens. Together, the results indicate that 3D-printed models can provide a feasible and cost-effective method for mating studies of insects.",Altica; Chrysomelidae; 3D-printed model; Intraspecific recognition; Mating choice; Behavioral assay,2021,31,4,10.1007/s00049-021-00345-5,0937-7409,13,90,220,1378,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
CHEMOECOLOGY,"A multicomponent marking pheromone produced by the pepper weevil, Anthonomus eugeni (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)","Insects in several orders deposit marking pheromones following oviposition. In addition to preventing the female from visiting the same site again, the pheromone also signals the presence of eggs to conspecific females. This form of chemical marking is particularly prevalent in species which oviposit on discrete hosts with limited resources available for developing larvae. The pepper weevil is a major pest of cultivated pepper throughout the southern United States, Mexico and the Caribbean. The weevil deposits eggs singly in a cavity chewed in flower buds and small fruits and caps these cavities with a plug derived from an anal secretion. The deterrent was found to be located in this oviposition plug and comprised of volatile and contact-acting components. Plug volatiles were collected by inducing oviposition into Teflon tape sachets containing pepper leaves and collecting volatiles from plugs laid on the tape surface. Of the two major components observed by GC/MS analyses, only acetophenone elicited a behavioral response by the female weevil in small arena and wind tunnel assays. Investigations of the oviposition plug matrix identified several free unsaturated and saturated fatty acids as major constituents of the plug which was in stark contrast to pepper tissue and seeds that contained only trace levels of free fatty acids and a distinctly different total fatty acid composition. The combined free fatty acids as well as acetophenone tested singly gave no significant reduction in oviposition while a plug-mimicking blend of unsaturated fatty acids tested in combination with acetophenone as artificial `plug spots,' decreased oviposition on treated peppers by up to 75\%. We propose that the combination of volatile and contact acting marking components improves oviposition site selection efficiency by pepper weevils on discrete hosts.",Oviposition deterring; Host marking pheromone; Epideictic pheromone; unsaturated fatty acids; Acetophenone,2021,31,4,10.1007/s00049-021-00347-3,0937-7409,13,111,281,1863,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
CHEMOECOLOGY,Antioxidant metabolites from riparian fungal endophytes improve the tolerance of rice seedlings to flooding,"Endophytic fungi have the potential to enhance plant resistance to various stresses and promote the ecological adaptation of the hosts. To evaluate the effects of the riparian endophytes on rice seedlings to flooding tolerance, here we screened out two fungi from the plant Myricaria laxiflora growing in the Yangtze River zone. Through morphological characteristics and rDNA ITS (internal transcriber region) sequence, the two strains were, respectively, identified as Aspergillus fumigatus and Chaetomium globosum. Metabolites derived from both fungi were capable of increasing tolerance of rice to flooding. Systematic separation and purification coupled to bioassays revealed that two natural antioxidants, Z-N-4-hydroxystyryl formamide (NFA) and chaetoglobosin A (CheA), were effective for alleviating flooding stress. Both NFA and CheA can reverse the decline trend of oxidative parameters caused by long-term flooding, such as malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, ethanol dehydrogenase, and NADPH oxidase. Gene expression analyses of NADPH oxidase families indicated that OsRbohB could be involved in conferring flooding tolerance mediated by the two natural antioxidants.

Weevil identifications were confirmed using morphology and molecular tools. CHC extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the relative peak areas in profiles were compared; compounds were identified according to MS fragmentation and retention indices. CHC profiles of the seven species of Gonipterus analyzed differed from each other, and from another weevil genus (Oxyops), used as an outgroup.

However, their diversity and relationships are poorly understood. A multi-gene phylogenetic analysis of 48 North American sesiid species confirmed the traditional taxonomic tribal ranks, demonstrated the paraphyly of Carmenta and Synanthedon with respect to several other genera and ultimately provided minimal phylogenetic resolution within and between North American and European groups. Character support from each gene suggested inconsistency between the phylogenetic signal of the CAD gene and that of the other four genes. However, removal of CAD from subsequent phylogenetic analyses did not substantially change the initial phylogenetic results or return Carmenta and Synanthedon as reciprocally monophyletic, suggesting that it was not impacting the overall phylogenetic signal. The lack of resolution using genes that are typically informative at the species level for other lepidopterans suggests a surprisingly rapid radiation of species in Carmenta/Synanthedon.

Our final dataset consists of 158 species, including at least one exemplar from all 109 currently recognized Celastrales genera. We performed nine quality-control steps and compared the inferred resolution, branch support, and topological congruence of the inferred gene and species trees with those generated after each of the first six steps. We describe and justify each of our quality-control steps, including manual masking, in detail so that they may be readily applied to other lineages. We found that highly supported clades could generally be relied upon even if stringent orthology and alignment quality-control measures had not been applied. But separate instances were identified, for both concatenation and coalescence, wherein a clade was highly supported before manual masking but then subsequently contradicted.

CLADISTICS,Combined data analysis of fossil and living mammals: a Paleogene sister taxon of Placentalia and the antiquity of Marsupialia,"The Cretaceous-Paleogene (KPg) boundary, one of Earth's five major extinction events, occurred just before the appearance of Placentalia in the fossil record. The Gobi Desert, Mongolia and the Western Interior of North America have important fossil mammals occurring just before and after the KPg boundary (e.g. Prodiacodon, Deltatheridium) that have yet to be phylogenetically tested in a character-rich context with molecular data. We present here phylogenetic analyses of >6000 newly scored anatomical observations drawn from six untested fossils and added to the largest existing morphological matrix for mammals. These data are combined with sequence data from 27 nuclear genes. Results show the existence of a new eutherian sister clade to Placentalia, which we name and characterize. The extinct clade Leptictidae is part of this placental sister clade, indicating that the sister clade survived the KPg event to co-exist in ancient ecosystems during the Paleogene radiation of placentals. Analysing the Cretaceous metatherian Deltatheridium in this character-rich context reveals it is a member of Marsupialia, a finding that extends the minimum age of Marsupialia before the KPg boundary. Numerous shared-derived features from multiple anatomical systems support the assignment of Deltatheridium to Marsupialia.

CLADISTICS,Diversification of the phytophagous lineages of true bugs (Insecta: Hemiptera: Heteroptera) shortly after that of the flowering plants,"More than 95\% of phytophagous true bug (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) species belong to four superfamilies: Miroidea (Cimicomorpha), Pentatomoidea, Coreoidea, and Lygaeoidea (all Pentatomomorpha). These iconic groups of highly diverse, overwhelmingly phytophagous insects include several economically prominent agricultural and silvicultural pest species, though their evolutionary history has not yet been well resolved. In particular, superfamily- and family-level phylogenetic relationships of these four lineages have remained controversial, and the divergence times of some crucial nodes for phytophagous true bugs have hitherto been little known, which hampers a better understanding of the evolutionary processes and patterns of phytophagous insects. In the present study, we used 150 species and concatenated nuclear and mitochondrial protein-coding genes and rRNA genes to infer the phylogenetic relationships within the Terheteroptera (Cimicomorpha + Pentatomomorpha) and estimated their divergence times. Our results support the monophyly of Cimicomorpha, Pentatomomorpha, Miroidea, Pentatomoidea, Pyrrhocoroidea, Coreoidea, and Lygaeoidea. The phylogenetic relationships across phytophagous lineages are largely congruent at deep nodes across the analyses based on different datasets and tree-reconstructing methods with just a few exceptions. Estimated divergence times and ancestral state reconstructions for feeding habit indicate that phytophagous true bugs explosively radiated in the Early Cretaceous-shortly after the angiosperm radiation-with the subsequent diversification of the most speciose clades (Mirinae, Pentatomidae, Coreinae, and Rhyparochromidae) in the Late Cretaceous.",NA,2022,38,4,10.1111/cla.12501,0748-3007,18,134,212,1696,NA,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
CLADISTICS,"Diversity, host specificity and biogeography in the Cladocorynidae (Hydrozoa, Capitata), with description of a new genus","The hydrozoan family Cladocorynidae inhabits tropical to temperate waters and comprises the two genera Pteroclava and Cladocoryne. Pteroclava lives in association with some octocorals and hydrozoans, whereas Cladocoryne is more generalist in terms of substrate choice. This work provides a thorough morpho-molecular reassessment of the Cladocorynidae by presenting the first well-supported phylogeny of the family based on the analyses of three mitochondrial and four nuclear markers. Notably, the two nominal genera were confirmed to be monophyletic and both morphological and genetic data led to the formal description of a new genus exclusively associated with octocorals, Pseudozanclea gen. nov. Maggioni \& Montano. Accordingly, the diagnosis of the family was updated. The ancestral state reconstruction of selected characters revealed that the symbiosis with octocorals likely appeared in the most recent common ancestor of Pteroclava and Pseudozanclea. Additionally, the presence of euryteles aggregation in the polyp stage and the exumbrellar nematocyst pouches with euryteles represent synapomorphies of all cladocorynid taxa and probably emerged in their most recent common ancestor. The analysis of several Pteroclava krempfi colonies from Indo-Pacific and Caribbean localities associated with several host octocorals revealed a high intra-specific genetic variability. Single- and multi-locus species delimitations resulted in three to five species hypotheses, but the statistical analysis of morphometric data showed only limited distinction among the clades of P. krempfi. However, P. krempfi clades showed differences in both host specificity, mostly at the octocoral family level, and geographic distribution, with one clade found exclusively in the Caribbean Sea and the others found in the Indo-Pacific.",NA,2022,38,1,10.1111/cla.12480,0748-3007,16,120,253,1822,NA,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
CLADISTICS,Female terminalia morphology and cladistic relations among Tok-Tok beetles (Tenebrionidae: Sepidiini),"Tok-tokkies are one of the most iconic lineages within Tenebrionidae. In addition to containing some of the largest darkling beetles, this tribe is recognized for its remarkable form of sexual communication known as substrate tapping. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic relationships within the group remain poorly understood. This study investigates the usefulness of female terminalia morphology for delimiting Sepidiini and reconstructing relationships among it. Data on the structure of the ovipositors, genital tubes and spicula ventrali have been generated for >200 species representing 28 Pimeliinae tribes. This dataset was used in a comparative analysis at the subfamilial level, which resulted in recognition of several unique features of tok-tokkie terminalia. Additionally, new features linking phenotypically challenging tribes also were recovered (Cryptochilini + Idisiini + Pimeliini). Secondly, 23 characters linked to the structure of female terminalia were defined for tok-tok beetles. Cladistic analysis demonstrates the nonmonophyletic nature of most of the recognized subtribes. The morphological dataset was analysed separately and in combination with available molecular data (CAD, Wg, cox1, cox2, 28S). All obtained topologies were largely congruent, supporting the following changes: Palpomodina Kaminski \& Gearner subtr.n. is erected to accommodate the genera Namibomodes and Palpomodes; Argenticrinis and Bombocnodulus are transferred from Hypomelina to Molurina; 153 species and subspecies previously classified within Psammodes are distributed over three separate genera (Mariazofia Kaminski nom.n., Piesomera stat.r., Psammodes sens.n.). Psammodes sklodowskae Kaminski \& Gearner sp.n. is described. Preliminary investigation of the ovipositor of Mariazofia basuto (Koch) comb.n. was carried out with the application of microcomputed tomography, illuminating the muscular system as a reliable reference point for recognizing homologous elements in highly modified ovipositors.",systematics; classification; ovipositor; microcomputed tomography,2022,38,6,10.1111/cla.12510,0748-3007,11,101,265,2003,4,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
CLADISTICS,Highly diversified mitochondrial genomes provide new evidence for interordinal relationships in the Arachnida,"Arachnida is an exceptionally diverse class in the Arthropoda, consisting of 20 orders and playing crucial roles in the terrestrial ecosystems. However, their interordinal relationships have been debated for over a century. Rearranged or highly rearranged mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) were consistently found in this class, but their various extent in different lineages and efficiency for resolving arachnid phylogenies are unclear. Here, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees using mitogenome sequences of 290 arachnid species to decipher interordinal relationships as well as diversification through time. Our results recovered monophyly of ten orders (i.e. Amblypygi, Araneae, Ixodida, Mesostigmata, Opiliones, Pseudoscorpiones, Ricinulei, Sarcoptiformes, Scorpiones and Solifugae), while rejecting monophyly of the Trombidiformes due to the unstable position of the Eriophyoidea. The monophyly of Acari (subclass) was rejected, possibly due to the long-branch attraction of the Pseudoscorpiones. The monophyly of Arachnida was further rejected because the Xiphosura nested within arachnid orders with unstable positions. Mitogenomes that are highly rearranged in mites but less rearranged or conserved in the remaining lineages point to their exceptional diversification in mite orders; however, shared derived mitochondrial (mt) gene clusters were found within superfamilies rather than interorders, confusing phylogenetic signals in arachnid interordinal relationships. Molecular dating results show that arachnid orders have ancient origins, ranging from the Ordovician to the Carboniferous, yet have significantly diversified since the Cretaceous in orders Araneae, Mesostigmata, Sarcoptiformes, and Trombidiformes. By summarizing previously resolved key positions of some orders, we propose a plausible arachnid tree of life. Our results underline a more precise framework for interordinal phylogeny in the Arachnida and provide new insights into their ancient evolution.",NA,2022,38,4,10.1111/cla.12504,0748-3007,13,109,262,1986,NA,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
CLADISTICS,Hyb-Seq provides new insights into the phylogeny and evolution of the Chrysanthemum zawadskii species complex in China,"A species complex is an assemblage of closely related species with blurred boundaries, and from which species could arise from different speciation processes and/or a speciation continuum. Such a complex can provide an opportunity to investigate evolutionary mechanisms acting on speciation. The Chrysanthemum zawadskii species complex in China, a monophyletic group of Chrysanthemum, consists of seven species with considerable morphological variation, diverse habitats and different distribution patterns. Here, we used Hyb-Seq data to construct a well-resolved phylogeny of the C. zawadskii complex. Then, we performed comparative analyses of variation patterns in morphology, ecology and distribution to investigate the roles of geography and ecology in this complex's diversification. Lastly, we implemented divergence time estimation, species distribution modelling and ancestral area reconstruction to trace the evolutionary history of this complex. We concluded that the C. zawadskii complex originated in the Qinling-Daba mountains during the early Pliocene and then spread west and northward along the mountain ranges to northern China. During this process, geographical and ecological factors imposing different influences resulted in the current diversification and distribution patterns of this species complex, which is composed of both well-diverged species and diverging lineages on the path of speciation.",species complex; Hyb-Seq; plastid genomes; species distribution modelling; evolutionary history,2022,38,6,10.1111/cla.12514,0748-3007,17,118,194,1422,5,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
CLADISTICS,Molecular phylogeny and evolution of Calaphidinae (Hemiptera: Aphididae),"Calaphidinae is the second-largest subfamily in the family Aphididae. Despite their species diversity and some taxonomic controversy, no phylogenetic studies have been conducted on them thus far. Herein, we report the first molecular phylogeny of Calaphidinae and two related lineages, Phyllaphidinae and Saltusaphidinae, based on five genes (3418 bp) for 126 taxa. Maximum parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses were performed on the multilocus dataset. Divergence time estimation, biogeographical reconstruction, ancestral host plant reconstruction and PhyloType analyses were performed to identify evolutionary trends in Calaphidinae. Our phylogenetic results lead to several conclusions: Phyllaphidinae is a sister group to Calaphidinae s.l.; Calaphidinae is paraphyletic with respect to the former ``Saltusaphidinae{''}; the ingroup clade was subdivided into nine newly recognized lineages; and three subtribes of Calaphidinae (Monaphidina, Calaphdina and Panaphidina) and many genera were not recovered as monophyletic. A new classification is proposed with eight tribal divisions that reflect our phylogenetic results, including three new tribes (Pterocallidini trib.n., Pseudochromaphidini trib.n. and Shivaphidini trib.n.) and three new statuses (Saltusaphidini stat.n., Therioaphidini stat.n. and Myzocallidini stat.n.). The ancestral reconstruction results imply that the ingroup taxa's common ancestor originated in the Eastern Palaearctic and might have fed on Fagaceae in the Late Cretaceous. Later, multiple host shifts and an expanding geographical distribution led to the current species diversity of Calaphidinae. Our reconstructions suggest that species diversification cannot solely be explained by speciation via host shifts and that geographical isolation probably also played a key role. Our results provide new insight into the natural classification and history of the host plant associations and biogeography of Calaphidinae s.l.",NA,2022,38,2,10.1111/cla.12487,0748-3007,8,72,262,1991,NA,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
CLADISTICS,New insights into the phylogeny of the complex thalloid liverworts (Marchantiopsida) based on chloroplast genomes,"Marchantiopsida (complex thalloid liverworts) are one of the earliest lineages of embryophytes (land plants), and well-known for their air pores and chambers, pegged rhizoids, and absence of organellular RNA editing sites. Despite their importance to an understanding of early embryophyte evolution, many key nodes within this class remain poorly resolved, owing to the paucity of genetic loci previously available for phylogenetic analyses. Here, we sequenced 54 plastomes, representing 28 genera, nearly all families, and all orders of Marchantiopsida. Based on these plastomes, we present a hypothesis of deep relationships within the class, and make the first investigations of gene contents and synteny. Overall, the Marchantiopsida plastomes were well-conserved, with the exception of the genus Cyathodium that has plastomes with higher GC content, fewer single sequence repeats (SSRs), and more structural variations, implying that this genus might possess RNA editing sites. Abundant repetitive elements and six highly divergent regions were identified as suitable for future infrafamilial taxonomic studies. The phylogenetic topology of Sphaerocarpales, Neohodgsoniales and Blasiales within Marchantiopsida was essentially congruent with previous studies but generally we obtained higher support values. Based on molecular evidence and previous morphological studies, we include Lunulariales in Marchantiales and suggest the retention of narrowed delimitation of monotypic families. The phylogenetic relationships within Marchantiales were better resolved, and 13 monophyletic families were recovered. Our analyses confirmed that the loss of intron 2 of ycf3 is a synapomorphy of Marchantiidae. Finally, we propose a new genus, Asterellopsis (Aytoniaceae), and present an updated classification of Marchantiopsida.

CLADISTICS,"New troodontid theropod specimen from Inner Mongolia, China clarifies phylogenetic relationships of later-diverging small-bodied troodontids and paravian body size evolution","A new troodontid (LH PV39) recovered from the Upper Cretaceous Wulansuhai Formation, Inner Mongolia, China, is described, highlighting the dorsoventrally compressed sacral centra. The completely fused neurocentral junctions indicate that LH PV39 had reached adulthood at the time of death, but its size is nevertheless 20\% smaller than that of the sympatric Philovenator, demonstrating that it is the second small-bodied troodontid recovered from the Wulansuhai Formation. Phylogenetic analyses scoring LH PV39 using different strategies and performed with different algorithms unambiguously recovered it as a troodontid. While the parsimony-based analysis scoring LH PV39 as an independent OTU with all of its available characteristics included recovered it as a basal troodontid, the Bayesian analysis suggests a closer relationship of LH PV39 to Almas and an unnamed troodontid from Ukhaa Tolgod, Mongolia (MPC-D100/1126+D100/3500). Body size analysis confirmed a single trend of gigantism throughout the evolution of troodontids, and suggests that the Late Cretaceous troodontids evolved in two directions: (i) several size-independent characteristics evolved while retaining the small sizes that are typical of the Early Cretaceous relatives, resulting in the Late Cretaceous small-bodied troodontids; and (ii) size-dependent characteristics (e.g., the elongation of the rostrum) evolved accompanying the size increase, resulting in large-bodied derived troodontids. The mosaic features of the Late Cretaceous small-bodied troodontids place them intermediate between their Early Cretaceous basal relatives and the Late Cretaceous large-bodied taxa in a well-resolved phylogeny, which is crucial for understanding the size and morphological evolution of troodontids.",NA,2022,38,1,10.1111/cla.12467,0748-3007,20,173,240,1771,NA,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
CLADISTICS,Parsimony analysis of phylogenomic datasets (II): evaluation of PAUP{* MEGA and MPBoot,"This paper examines the implementation of parsimony methods in the programs PAUP{*}, MEGA and MPBoot, and compares them with TNT. PAUP{* implements standard, well-tested algorithms, and flexible search strategies and options for handling trees; its main drawback is the lack of advanced search algorithms, which makes it difficult to find most parsimonious trees for large and complex datasets. In addition, branch-swapping can be much slower than in TNT for datasets with large numbers of taxa, although this is only occasionally a problem for phylogenomic datasets given that they typically have small numbers of taxa. The parsimony implementation of MEGA has major drawbacks. MEGA often fails to find parsimonious trees because it does not perform all possible branch swapping subtree pruning regrafting (SPR)/tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) rearrangements. It furthermore fails to properly handle ambiguity or multiple equally parsimonious trees, and it uses the same addition sequence for all bootstrap replicates. The latter yields values of group support that depend on the order in which taxa are listed in the dataset. In addition, tree searches are very slow and do not facilitate the exploration of different starting points (as random seed is fixed). MPBoot searches for optimal trees using the ratchet, but it is based on SPR instead of TBR (and only evaluates by default a subset of the SPR rearrangements). MPBoot approximates bootstrap frequencies by first finding a sample of trees and then selecting from those trees for every replicate, without performing a tree-search. The approximation is too rough in many cases, producing serious under- or overestimations of the correct support values and, for most kinds of datasets, slower estimations than can be obtained with TNT. In addition, bootstrapping with PAUP{*}, MEGA or MPBoot can attribute strong supports to groups that have no support at all under any meaningful concept of support, such as likelihood ratios or Bremer supports. In TNT, this problem is decreased by using the strict consensus tree to represent each replicate, or eliminated entirely by using different approximations of the Bremer support.",NA,2022,38,1,10.1111/cla.12476,0748-3007,12,86,334,2183,NA,NA,300,5,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
CLADISTICS,Patterns of morphological simplification and innovation in the megadiverse Holometabola (Insecta),"We analyzed patterns of complexity and simplicity in holometabolan insects using parsimony and maximum-likelihood. By contrast with other groups of arthropods (and most other groups of animals), insects have undergone a stepwise process of structural simplification in their evolution. The megadiverse Holometabola are characterized mainly by structurally simplified larvae, which differ strongly from the adults in their morphology and usually also in their life habits. Although smaller groups such as Neuropterida have largely maintained their structural complexity in adults and immature life stages, a series of reductions occurred with the appearance and diversification of Coleopterida, Mecopterida and especially Antliophora. Parasitic Strepsiptera or fleas display conspicuous patterns of reduction in different life stages and body regions, and high degrees of simplification also occur in groups with short-lived adults. Larvae living in moist substrates display far-reaching structural simplifications and also morphological uniformity, especially in the species-rich Diptera, but also in other groups. Liquid feeding leads to correlated simplifications and innovation of adult head structures, especially of the mouthparts. Functional or anatomical dipterism leads to an optimization of the flight apparatus in most holometabolous groups, which is correlated with reductions in one of the pterothoracic segments, and coupled (e.g. by hamuli), partly reduced or transformed wings (e.g. halteres). In flightless groups, the pterothoracic skeleto-muscular apparatus is strongly simplified. In the abdomen of adult females a stepwise reduction of the lepismatoid ovipositor occurs. By contrast, the male genital apparatus often undergoes an extreme diversification. Our evaluations revealed a highly correlated complexity between larval and adult stages.",NA,2022,38,2,10.1111/cla.12483,0748-3007,11,97,252,1863,NA,NA,300,5,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
COMMUNITY ECOLOGY,Spatial non-stationarity in the distribution of fish species richness of tropical streams,"Diversity gradients are observed for various groups of organisms. For fishes in streams, the water-energy, productivity, and temporal heterogeneity hypotheses can explain richness patterns. The relationship between species diversity and the variables that represent these hypotheses is generally linear and stationary, that is, the effect of each of those variables is constant throughout a geographically defined area. But the assumption of spatial stationarity has not yet been tested on a great number of diversity gradients. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the spatial stationarity in the relationships between fish species richness in small stream (653 streams) located throughout Brazil, and the water-energy, productivity, and temporal heterogeneity hypotheses using a geographically weighted regression-GWR. There was a conspicuous absence of spatial stationarity in fish species richness. Furthermore, water-energy dynamics represented a possible metabolic restriction acting on the community structuring of fish species richness in streams. This mechanism separated the fish fauna into two regions: (i) The Amazonian region, characterized by a stable climate and populations that are less resistant to climatic variation; and (ii) The central region, featured by greater ranges of temperature and fish populations that are resistant to climatic variation.",Climatic temporal heterogeneity; Freshwater ecoregions; GWR; Primary productivity; Water-energy,2023,24,1,10.1007/s42974-022-00121-7,1585-8553,12,89,189,1365,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Considering this situation, we aim in this study to improve the knowledge and information available on the functioning of Mogador marine protected area (MPA), one of the marine ecosystems in the Moroccan Atlantic coasts which was established to support the conservation of the local fisheries. An Ecopath model is applied for this Mogador MPA which is represented by 27 functional groups including 18 fishes, which are grouped based on many criteria mainly their size and commercial importance in the fisheries of the study region. A series of indicator for the food web are identified through model statistics and web analysis. The results obtained show relatively high ecotrophic efficiency with a transfer efficiency close to10\%, indicating a good degree of stability.

Anthropogenic activities have a global impact on avifauna, particularly in Bangladesh, where human disturbances and unplanned urbanization can lead to the decline of this particular taxon. A direct observation-based study was conducted to investigate the avian community structure in Daudkandi Upazila, Bangladesh. We used the line transect method at 65 sampling grids to assess the avifauna from May 2019 to March 2020. We evaluated the bird assemblage structures by alpha diversity and beta diversity. Ninety-six species of bird belonging to thirteen orders were recorded. We found the rural study site to be more diverse (H ` = 3.835) and evenly distributed (J ` = 0.88) than urban and semi-urban sites. ANOSIM test also showed that the rural avian community differed significantly from other two communities (R = 0.1603; P = 0.0001). We calculated dispersion patterns of birds and found clumped pattern to be more common (83 species) in the study area. This study discovered some anthropogenic activities, in addition to human intrusions, that may have reduced avian diversity in urban and semi-urban habitats.

COMMUNITY ECOLOGY,Community structure of fish larvae in different biotopes of a neotropical river,"Spatial heterogeneity is one of the major sources of compositional dissimilarity among fish in different biotopes. The availability and distribution of refuge, food, and habitats for breeding are determinants of the presence of fish species with different life histories, and understanding how this composition is organized along an environmental gradient is important for the protection of fish spawning sites and preservation of conditions that favor the dispersion and growth of their larvae. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate how the ichthyoplankton community is structured in different biotopes (river, lake, and transitional) of a fluvial system and to determine the factors involved in the structuring process. We conducted sampling in the lower Ivinhema River, upper Parana River floodplain, Brazil, during two consecutive reproductive periods between 2010 and 2012. Larvae of long-distance migratory species were more related to the river biotope, while the non-migratory or short-distance migrators were more associated with transitional and lake biotopes. Therefore, our results indicate that the hydrodynamic conditions of the river, especially the flow velocity, as well as the parental reproductive guild, influence the distribution patterns of the ichthyoplankton community.",Spatial heterogeneity; Larvae; Reproduction; Freshwater fish; Floodplain,2022,23,1,10.1007/s42974-021-00066-3,1585-8553,12,79,183,1290,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
COMMUNITY ECOLOGY,Revisiting discrepancies between stochastic agent-based and deterministic models,"Predicting which species will present (or absent) across geographical regions, and where, remains one of the important issues in ecology. From a methodical viewpoint, one of the concerns in examining species presence-absence across an environmental gradient is about the robustness of model-based predictions, which are given by distinct modelling frameworks used. Generally, different complexities and ecological factors are incorporated into such models, e.g. abiotic environments, spatial dispersal process, and stochasticity. Motivated by these ecological issues, we revisit a single-species logistic growth problem by employing stochastic agent-based model (ABM) and deterministic system and extend these frameworks to incorporate the effects of spatially changing environments. We observe that our ABM, which is formulated using random walk theory and birth-death process, demonstrates important qualitative behaviours that are consistent with the underlying theories of stochastic process. The results of ABM with large population sizes also agree with those of the deterministic equation. However, some discrepancies are observed when the population size is small. The ABM densities seem to underestimate the deterministic solutions, which illustrate the effects of stochasticity on small populations with some individuals may go extinct simply by chance. To quantify the underestimation of ABM as opposed to deterministic predictions, we employ certain probabilistic techniques: while the means of quasistationary probabilities distribution appear to give a counterintuitive prediction particularly near the edge of species ranges, the expected values given by state probabilities distribution are in agreement with the ABM densities observed for small population sizes across spatial locations. These salient observations depict emergent behaviours of stochastic ABM, which can contribute to additional insights on the dynamics of ecological species. It also shows how such small-scale interactions coupled with local dispersal and spatial phenomena occurring at a microscopic level can affect macroscopic-level dynamics. As such, comparing and contrasting the dynamics of different models can help in understanding the generality of ecological results and may offer important insights into the robustness of model-based predictions of species presence-absence.",Stochastic and deterministic models; Logistic growth; Abiotic environments; Spatial dispersal process,2022,23,"3, SI",10.1007/s42974-022-00118-2,1585-8553,8,80,322,2371,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
COMMUNITY ECOLOGY,"Small mammals in a mountain ecosystem: the effect of topographic, micrometeorological, and biological correlates on their community structure","An increasing number of studies have investigated spatial and temporal patterns in species richness and assemblage composition in mountain ecosystems along altitudinal gradients. Small mammals have been successfully used as indicators of environmental health and as proxies of biodiversity. However, information about the composition and distribution of species assemblages in the mosaic of habitat and rocky landform types at a high altitude is still lacking for most of the mountain regions. Through the use of live traps and camera trapping, we described the small mammal community living above the treeline of the Western Dolomites (Italian Alps), investigating the species richness, abundance of individuals and community composition in relation to topographic, micrometeorological, mesohabitat, and biological correlates. A total of five species and 50 individuals were sampled, analysed, and released. At the extremes of the analysed altitudinal range (i.e. 1900 vs 2900 m a.s.l.), community composition was completely different and species richness was related to elevation, steepness, and vegetation cover. At the same time, the taxonomic distinctness of ground-dwelling arthropods (namely carabid beetles and spiders), a proxy of habitat complexity, showed higher values in areas with a greater small mammal species richness. We found a positive effect of steepness and rocky landform type ``carsism{''} on the number of captured individuals, showing the importance of the availability of shelters and underground burrows for the sampled species. As a confirmation of the altitudinal shift for these species in relation to the ongoing climate change, we detected a negative impact of sub-surface ground temperature on small mammal abundance during the monitoring period.

CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,A simple DEB-based ecosystem model,"A minimum stoichiometric carbon and nitrogen model of an entire ecosystem based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is presented. The ecosystem contains nutrients, producers, consumers, decomposers and detritus. All three living groups consist of somatic structure and either one (consumers and decomposers) or two (producers) reserve compartments, hence the living matter is described by seven state variables. Four types of detritus are distinguished. As the system is closed for matter, the dynamics of the nutrients carbon dioxide and ammonium follow automatically from the dynamics of the other 11 state variables. All DEB organisms in the model are V1-morphs, which means that surface area of each organism is proportional to volume. The resulting ontogenetic symmetry implies that complicated modelling of size structure is not required.

CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,Analysis of a mechanistic model of corals in association with multiple symbionts: within-host competition and recovery from bleaching,"Coral reefs are increasingly experiencing stressful conditions, such as high temperatures, that cause corals to undergo bleaching, a process where they lose their photosynthetic algal symbionts. Bleaching threatens both corals' survival and the health of the reef ecosystems they create. One possible mechanism for corals to resist bleaching is through association with stress-tolerant symbionts, which are resistant to bleaching but may be worse partners in mild conditions. Some corals have been found to associate with multiple symbiont species simultaneously, which potentially gives them access to the benefits of both stress-sensitive and -tolerant symbionts. However, within-host competition between symbionts may lead to competitive exclusion of one partner, and the consequences of associating with multiple partners simultaneously are not well understood. We modify a mechanistic model of coral-algal symbiosis to investigate the effect of environmental conditions on within-host competitive dynamics between stress-sensitive and -tolerant symbionts and the effect of access to a tolerant symbiont on the dynamics of recovery from bleaching. We found that the addition of a tolerant symbiont can increase host survival and recovery from bleaching in high-light conditions. Competitive exclusion of the tolerant symbiont occurred slowly at intermediate light levels. Interestingly, there were some cases of post-bleaching competitive exclusion after the tolerant symbiont had helped the host recover.",NA,2022,10,1,10.1093/conphys/coac066,2051-1434,18,133,209,1509,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Stakeholders in the region often assess risk to species of interest based on these differing levels of development. We collected blood samples from 81 adult and 35 chick eastern brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis carolinensis) from 10 colonies across the northern Gulf of Mexico and used these to establish baseline values for hematology and blood biochemistry. We assessed the potential influence of body condition, sex and home range size on hematology and blood biochemistry. We also assessed potential influences of oil and gas activity by considering differing levels of oil and gas development that occur regionally throughout the study area. Although blood analyte concentrations of adults and chicks were often associated with these regional differences, the pattern we observed was not entirely consistent with the differing levels of oil and gas activity across the Gulf, suggesting that regional levels of oil and gas activity around breeding sites may not be the primary drivers of hematology and blood biochemistry. We note that baseline values or reference intervals are not available for other nearshore seabirds that breed in the northern Gulf.

Sperm cryopreservation is a vital tool in amphibian assisted reproductive technologies that aids in genetic and population management, specifically for at-risk species. Significant advancements have been made in the cryopreservation of amphibian sperm, yet there is little information on how the cryopreservation process influences fertilization and embryonic development. In this study, we tested several cryoprotective agents (CPAs) and freezing rates on sperm recovery, fertilization potential and embryo development using Fowler's toads (Anaxyrus fowleri) as a model amphibian species for application to at-risk anurans. Three cryoprotectant treatments were tested, which included 10\% trehalose + 0.25\% bovine serum albumin with (1) 5\% N,N-dimethylformamide (DMFA); (2) 10\% DMFA; or (3) 10\% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Additionally, sperm in each cryoprotectant was frozen at two different rates, -32 to -45 degrees C/min and -20 to -29 degrees C/min. Post-thaw sperm analysis included motility, morphology, viability, fertilization success and embryo development. Results show that 10\% DMFA produced significantly higher (P = 0.005) post-thaw sperm motility than 5\% DMFA and was similar to 10\% DMSO. Furthermore, sperm frozen at -32 to -45 degrees C/min had significantly higher post-thaw motility (P < 0.001) compared to sperm frozen at -20 to -29 degrees C/min. We also found that embryos fertilized with sperm frozen with 5\% DMFA resulted in significantly higher (P = 0.02) cleavage than 10\% DMSO, yet there was no other effect of CPA on fertilization or embryo development. Furthermore, embryos fertilized with sperm frozen at -32 to -45 degrees C/min resulted in significantly higher cleavage (P = 0.001), neurulation (P = 0.001) and hatching (P = 0.002) numbers than sperm frozen at a rate of -20 to -29 degrees C/min. Overall, eggs fertilized with frozen-thawed sperm produced 1327 tadpoles. These results provide insight towards a biobanking strategy that can be applied to imperilled species to preserve genetic lineages and bolster offspring genetic diversity for reintroduction.",model species; genome banking; freezing rate; cryoprotectant; assisted reproductive technologies,2022,10,1,10.1093/conphys/coac032,2051-1434,13,106,358,2468,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,Dynamic changes in the hormones of black-necked cranes during reproduction,"Changes in hormones of black-necked crane during different reproductive stages. Black-necked cranes (Grus nigricollis) are national first-level protected wild animals in China. Artificial breeding has been adopted by many zoos and reserves to achieve ex-situ conservation of black-necked cranes, but the breeding rate of the species in cages is low. This study used non-invasive methods combined with behavioural observations to investigate changes in sex hormones and glucocorticoid metabolites in the droppings of black-necked cranes during the breeding cycle, with the results showing that (i) levels of estradiol and testosterone in black-necked cranes increased significantly when they entered the breeding period, and these levels could be used as an important physiological indicator to effectively monitor the physiological status of females and males during the reproductive period, thus providing a theoretical basis for the timing of semen collection; (ii) the level of progesterone in the mid-reproduction stage was significantly higher than that in other stages in female black-necked cranes after successful mating, and this level could be an effective indicator of the mating status of female black-necked cranes; (iii) droppings' glucocorticoid metabolites in the breeding period showed different dynamics between paired and singly caged black-necked cranes, indicating that the physiological phenomenon of reproduction could result in a certain amount of physiological burden on black-necked cranes. These results provide a theoretical basis for the selection of physiological parameters in the artificial breeding of black-necked cranes.",sex hormone; glucocorticoid metabolites; droppings; black-necked crane; Artificial breeding,2022,10,1,10.1093/conphys/coac040,2051-1434,10,74,232,1655,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

We recorded heart rate and body temperature of 20 free-living greylag geese in response to a major regularly re-occurring anthropogenic disturbance-New Year's Eve fireworks. Heart rate and body temperature were significantly higher in the first and second hour of the new year, compared with the same hour on the 31st of December, the average during December and the average during January. Heart rate and body temperature was not significantly affected by sex or age. From 0200 to 0300 onwards, 1st of January heart rates did not significantly differ from the other periods; however, body temperatures were significantly increased until 0300-0400. From 0400 to 0500, heart rate was not affected by any of the investigated factors, whereas body temperature was significantly increased on the 1st of January compared with the 31st of December and the December average but not compared with the January average. To conclude, our results show that New Year's Eve fireworks cause a substantial physiological response, indicative of a stress response in greylag geese, which is costly in terms of energy expenditure.",wildlife conservation; heart rate; greylag geese; emotional arousal; anthropogenic disturbance; animal welfare,2022,10,1,10.1093/conphys/coac050,2051-1434,18,125,187,1204,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Growth, osmoregulation and ionoregulation of longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) yolk-sac larvae at different salinities","Longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) is a threatened anadromous fish species that spawns in freshwater to moderately brackish (i.e. 5-10 ppt) reaches of the upper San Francisco Estuary and has declined to similar to 1\% of its pre-1980s abundances. Despite 50+ years of population monitoring, the efficacy of 10+ years of conservation efforts for longfin smelt remain uncertain due to a limited understanding of how the species responds to environmental variation, such as salinity. For example, high mortality during larval stages has prevented culture efforts from closing the life cycle in captivity. Here, we investigated the effects of salinity on longfin smelt yolk-sac larvae. Newly hatched larvae from four single-pair crosses were acutely transferred to and reared at salinities of 0.4, 5, 10, 20 or 32 ppt. We compared whole-body water and sodium ion (Na+) content, notochord length and yolk-sac volume at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-transfer for each salinity treatment. We found that larvae maintained osmotic and ionic balance at 0.4-10 ppt, whereas salinities >10 ppt resulted in decreased water and increased whole-body Na content. We also found that larvae grew largest and survived the longest when reared at 5 and 10 ppt, respectively, and that yolk resorption stalled at 0.4 ppt. Finally, there were significant but small interclutch variations in responses to different salinities, with clutch accounting for <8\% of the variance in our statistical models. Overall, our results indicate that longfin smelt yolk-sac larvae likely perform best at moderately brackish conditions, thus yielding a mechanism that explains their distribution in field surveys and providing key information for future conservation efforts.",yolk resorption; San Francisco Estuary; fish; early life stages; Aquaculture,2022,10,1,10.1093/conphys/coac041,2051-1434,14,124,265,1744,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,Haematological and biochemical reference intervals for wild green turtles (Chelonia mydas): a Bayesian approach for small sample sizes,"Animal health is directly linked to population viability, which may be impacted by anthropogenic disturbances and diseases. Reference intervals (RIs) for haematology and blood biochemistry are essential tools for the assessment of animal health. However, establishing and interpreting robust RIs for threatened species is often challenged by small sample sizes. Bayesian predictive modelling is well suited to sample size limitations, accounting for individual variation and interactions between influencing variables. We aimed to derive baseline RIs for green turtles (Chelonia mydas) across two foraging aggregations in North Queensland, Australia, using Bayesian generalized linear mixed-effects models (n = 97). The predicted RIs were contained within previously published values and had narrower credible intervals. Most analytes did not vary significantly with foraging ground (76\%, 22/29), body mass (86\%, 25/29) or curved carapace length (83\%, 24/29). Length and body mass effects were found for eosinophils, heterophil:lymphocyte ratio, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase and urea. Significant differences between foraging grounds were found for albumin, cholesterol, potassium, total protein, triglycerides, uric acid and calcium:phosphorus ratio. We provide derived RIs for foraging green turtles, which will be helpful in future population health assessments and conservation efforts.

CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,"Hatchery and wild larval lake sturgeon experience effects of captivity on stress reactivity, behavior and predation risk","Reintroduction programs are important tools for wildlife conservation. However, captive rearing environments may lead to maladaptive behavior and physiological alterations that reduce survival probability after release. For captive rearing programs that raise individuals captured from the wild during early ontogeny for later release, there is a lack of information about when during ontogeny the detrimental effects of captive rearing may become evident. In this study we compared cortisol levels, predation rates and swimming behavior between hatchery-produced and wild-caught larval lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), a threatened fish species, at three times over 9 days. Cortisol levels did not indicate that hatchery-produced individuals were more stressed, but cortisol reactivity to an acute stressor disappeared for both hatchery-produced and wild-caught larvae after 9 days in the hatchery. Swimming activity levels decreased over time for hatchery-produced larvae but increased over time for wild-caught larvae, suggesting that behavioral trajectories may be programmed prior to the larval stage. Neither increasing nor decreasing activity levels was advantageous for survival, as predation rates increased over time in captivity for larvae from both treatments. Results suggest that physiological and behavioral phenotypes may not accurately predict survival for individuals released from reintroduction programs and that the captive environment may inhibit transition to the wild even if cortisol levels do not indicate high stress. Findings emphasize that even a short amount of time in captivity during early ontogeny can affect phenotypes of individuals captured from wild populations, which may impact the success of reintroduction programs.",survival; physiology; early ontogeny; cortisol; Captive rearing,2022,10,1,10.1093/conphys/coac062,2051-1434,17,120,244,1762,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,Impacts of ocean warming and acidification on the energy budget of three commercially important fish species,"Using experimental data of three commercially important marine fish species (Diplodus sargus, Diplodus cervinus and Solea senegalensis), a model based on Dynamic Energy Budget theory was parametrized. The model was used to produce projections of growth and reproduction for these species, under different scenarios of ocean warming and acidification. A mechanistic model based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory was developed to predict the combined effects of ocean warming, acidification and decreased food availability on growth and reproduction of three commercially important marine fish species: white seabream (Diplodus sargus), zebra seabream (Diplodus cervinus) and Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis). Model simulations used a parameter set for each species, estimated by the Add-my-Pet method using data from laboratory experiments complemented with bibliographic sources. An acidification stress factor was added as a modifier of the somatic maintenance costs and estimated for each species to quantify the effect of a decrease in pH from 8.0 to 7.4 (white seabream) or 7.7 (zebra seabream and Senegalese sole). The model was used to project total length of individuals along their usual lifespan and number of eggs produced by an adult individual within one year, under different climate change scenarios for the end of the 21st century. For the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change SSP5-8.5, ocean warming led to higher growth rates during the first years of development, as well as an increase of 32-34\% in egg production, for the three species. Ocean acidification contributed to reduced growth for white seabream and Senegalese sole and a small increase for zebra seabream, as well as a decrease in egg production of 48-52\% and 14-33\% for white seabream and Senegalese sole, respectively, and an increase of 4-5\% for zebra seabream. The combined effect of ocean warming and acidification is strongly dependent on the decrease of food availability, which leads to significant reduction in growth and egg production. This is the first study to assess the combined effects of ocean warming and acidification using DEB models on fish, therefore, further research is needed for a better understanding of these climate change-related effects among different taxonomic groups and species.",ocean warming; ocean acidification; fish metabolism; Dynamic Energy Budget; climate change,2022,10,1,10.1093/conphys/coac048,2051-1434,16,108,348,2311,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,Implementation of a method for sperm cryopreservation in sceloporine lizards,"Actual loss of lizard biodiversity continues, even with the implementation of conventional conservation programs. An approach including assisted reproductive techniques such as sperm cryopreservation may contribute to the management of endangered species. We developed a method for sperm cryopreservation in sceloporine lizards and compared the response among the studied species. Prior to the mating season, we obtained semen from adult males of Sceloporus aeneus (n = 21), Sceloporus grammicus (n = 20) and Sceloporus torquatus (n = 21) via pressure of the genital papilla. Volume and sperm concentration were measured before semen dilution in a Tris-egg yolk (TEY) medium to evaluate progressive motility, sperm viability, morphology, plasma membrane and acrosome integrity. Then, we cooled the remaining volumes to 5 degrees C at a rate of 0.1 degrees C per minute to incorporate glycerol (8\% v/v) in two fractions. Immediately afterwards, we placed 40 mu l of the mix on solid CO2 to form pellets and immersed them in liquid nitrogen for storage. We thawed the pellets at 29 degrees C for 3 minutes and diluted them 1:1 (v/v) in TEY medium to assess sperm quality. We found a positive relationship between body weight and seminal volume in S. grammicus and S. torquatus and a negative correlation with sperm concentration in S. grammicus (P < 0.05). Moreover, we observed that the freezing-thawing process decreased sperm quality in the three species, mostly affecting motility and viability. However, S. torquatus and S. aeneus showed a higher sperm tolerance than S. grammicus.",assisted reproductive techniques; cryopreservation; cryoprotectant; glycerol; reptile; semen,2022,10,1,10.1093/conphys/coac068,2051-1434,10,76,248,1585,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,Modelling the impact of condition-dependent responses and lipid-store availability on the consequences of disturbance in a cetacean,"Lipid-store body condition is fundamental to how animals cope with environmental fluctuations, including anthropogenic change. As it provides an energetic buffer, body condition is expected to influence risk-taking strategies, with both positive and negative relationships between body condition and risk-taking posited in the literature. Individuals in good condition may take more risks due to state-dependent safety ('ability-based' explanation), or alternatively fewer risks due to asset protection and reduced need to undertake risky foraging ('needs-based' explanation). Such state-dependent responses could drive non-linear impacts of anthropogenic activities through feedback between body condition and behavioural disturbance. Here, we present a simple bioenergetic model that explicitly incorporates hypothetical body condition-dependent response strategies for a cetacean, the sperm whale. The model considered the consequences of state-dependent foraging cessation and availability of wax ester (WE) lipids for calf provisioning and female survival. We found strikingly different consequences of disturbance depending on strategy and WE availability scenarios. Compared with the null strategy, where responses to disturbance were independent of body condition, the needs-based strategy mitigated predicted reductions in provisioning by 10\%-13\%, while the ability-based strategy exaggerated reductions by 63\%-113\%. Lower WE availability resulted in more extreme outcomes because energy stores were smaller relative to the daily energy balance. In the 0\% availability scenario, while the needs-based strategy reduced deaths by 100\%, the ability-based strategy increased them by 335\% relative to null and by 56\% relative to the same strategy under the 5\%-6.7\% WE availability scenario. These results highlight that state-dependent disturbance responses and energy store availability could substantially impact the population consequences of disturbance. Our ability to set appropriate precautionary disturbance thresholds therefore requires empirical tests of ability- vs needs-based response modification as a function of body condition and a clearer understanding of energy store availability. Body condition-dependent risk-taking is observed in many animal taxa but is little explored in cetaceans. We used model simulations to explore how uncertainties surrounding this behaviour and the metabolic physiology of deep-diving cetaceans may be limiting our understanding of the energetic consequences of anthropogenic disturbance.",Body condition; population consequences of disturbance; sperm whale,2022,10,1,10.1093/conphys/coac069,2051-1434,17,131,334,2550,3,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,Differential MC5R loss in whales and manatees reveals convergent evolution to the marine environment,"Melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R), which is expressed in the terminally differentiated sebaceous gland, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). MC5R exists mostly in mammals but is completely lost in whales; only the relic of MC5R can be detected in manatees, and phenotypically, they have lost sebaceous glands. Interestingly, whales and manatees are both aquatic mammals but have no immediate common ancestors. The loss of MC5R and sebaceous glands in whales and manatees is likely to be a result of convergent evolution. Here, we find that MC5R in whales and manatees are lost by two different mechanisms. Homologous recombination of MC5R in manatees and the insertion of reverse transcriptase in whales lead to the gene loss, respectively. On one hand, in manatees, there are two ``TTATC{''} sequences flanking MC5R, and homologous recombination of the segments between the two ``TTATC{''} sequences resulted in the partial loss of the sequence of MC5R. On the other hand, in whales, reverse transcriptase inserts between MC2R and RNMT on the chromosome led to the loss of MC5R. Based on these two different mechanisms for gene loss in whales and manatees, we finally concluded that MC5R loss might be the result of convergent evolution to the marine environment, and we explored the impact on biological function that is significant to environmental adaptation.",MC5R; Whales; Manatees; Mechanisms of gene lost; Convergent evolution,2022,232,2-Apr,10.1007/s00427-022-00688-1,0949-944X,14,100,215,1363,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,Dynamic changes in the association between maternal mRNAs and endoplasmic reticulum during ascidian early embryogenesis,"Axis formation is one of the most important events occurring at the beginning of animal development. In the ascidian egg, the antero-posterior axis is established at this time owing to a dynamic cytoplasmic movement called cytoplasmic and cortical reorganisation. During this movement, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and maternal mRNAs (postplasmic/PEM RNAs) are translocated to the future posterior side. Although accumulating evidence indicates the crucial roles played by the asymmetrical localisation of these organelles and the translational regulation of postplasmic/PEM RNAs, the organisation of ER has not been described in sufficient detail to date owing to technical difficulties. In this study, we developed three different multiple staining protocols for visualising the ER in combination with mitochondria, microtubules, or mRNAs in whole-mount specimens. We defined the internally expanded ``dense ER{''} using these protocols and described cisterna-like structures of the dense ER using focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy. Most importantly, we described the dynamic changes in the colocalisation of postplasmic/PEM mRNAs and dense ER; for example, macho-1 mRNA was detached and excluded from the dense ER during the second phase of ooplasmic movements. These detailed descriptions of the association between maternal mRNA and ER can provide clues for understanding the translational regulation mechanisms underlying axis determination during ascidian early embryogenesis.",Axis determination; ER translocation; Cytoskeleton; Maternal mRNA; Translational regulation,2022,232,1,10.1007/s00427-021-00683-y,0949-944X,15,119,207,1508,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,Identification of Nodal-dependent enhancer of amphioxus Chordin sufficient to drive gene expression into the chordate dorsal organizer,"The core molecular mechanisms of dorsal organizer formation during gastrulation are highly conserved within the chordate lineage. One of the key characteristics is that Nodal signaling is required for the organizer-specific gene expression. This feature appears to be ancestral, as evidenced by the presence in the most basally divergent chordate amphioxus. To provide a better understanding of the evolution of organizer-specific gene regulation in chordates, we analyzed the cis-regulatory sequence of amphioxus Chordin in the context of the vertebrate embryo. First, we generated stable zebrafish transgenic lines, and by using light-sheet fluorescent microscopy, characterized in detail the expression pattern of GFP driven by the cis-regulatory sequences of amphioxus Chordin. Next, we performed a 5'deletion analysis and identified an enhancer sufficient to drive the expression of the reporter gene into a chordate dorsal organizer. Finally, we found that the identified enhancer element strongly depends on Nodal signaling, which is consistent with the well-established role of this pathway in the regulation of the expression of dorsal organizer-specific genes across chordates. The enhancer identified in our study may represent a suitable simple system to study the interplay of the evolutionarily conserved regulatory mechanisms operating during early chordate development.",Chordin; Gene regulation; Nodal; Organizer of gastrulation; Gene regulation; Enhancer; Amphioxus; Chordate evolution; Light-sheet microscopy,2022,232,5-Jun,10.1007/s00427-022-00698-z,0949-944X,17,134,195,1385,9,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Often, scientific investigations involving the use of spiders face inevitable problems associated with the lack of specimens from laboratory stock, resulting in difficulties in yielding reproducible investigations for predictive research. Thus, several species of well-studied spiders, including Parasteatoda tepidariorum, have been successfully bred for such purposes. Crossopriza lyoni is a Haplogyne spider, globally distributed and widespread in human inhabitants, prompting interest in various studies over the last decades. Despite its scientific importance, no laboratory-bred C. lyoni has been documented. Therefore, we describe a successful captive breeding system of the species under controlled conditions to establish a laboratory stock culture.

DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,Lack of evidence for conserved parasegmental grooves in arthropods,"In the arthropod model species Drosophila melanogaster, a dipteran fly, segmentation of the anterior-posterior body axis is under control of a hierarchic gene cascade. Segmental boundaries that form morphological grooves are established posteriorly within the segmental expression domain of the segment-polarity gene (SPG) engrailed (en). More important for the development of the fly, however, are the parasegmental boundaries that are established at the interface of en expressing cells and anteriorly adjacent wingless (wg) expressing cells. In Drosophila, both segmental and transient parasegmental grooves form. The latter are positioned anterior to the expression of en. Although the function of the SPGs in establishing and maintaining segmental and parasegmental boundaries is highly conserved among arthropods, parasegmental grooves have only been reported for Drosophila, and a spider (Cupiennius salei). Here, we present new data on en expression, and re-evaluate published data, from four distantly related spiders, including Cupiennius, and a distantly related chelicerate, the harvestman Phalangium opilio. Gene expression analysis of en genes in these animals does not corroborate the presence of parasegmental grooves.

DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,Vibration exposure uncovers a critical early developmental window for zebrafish caudal fin development,"Mechanical influencers have long been shown to affect mature bone. Bone mechanosensation is a key feature that allows the skeleton to adapt to environmental constraints. In this study, we describe the response of immature, developing bones to a mechanical stimulus. To do so, zebrafish larvae at different stages of development were exposed to whole-body vibration (WBV) at a low frequency of 20 Hz, for up to 4 days. Whole mount Alizarin red and Alcian blue staining revealed age-related and bone type-specific defects. Specifically, the parhypural and hypural 1 caudal fin endoskeletal elements were affected when the exposure to WBV started early during their development. We show that these WBV-induced parhypural and hypural 1 patterning defects are triggered by a Sox9-independent pathway, potentially by reducing the distance separating adjacent chondrogenic condensations in the developing tail skeleton. The remaining hypurals were unaffected by the WBV treatment. Altogether, our results indicate that, upon exposure to vibration, chondrogenic cell progenitors can react to mechanical stimuli early during their development, which ultimately affects the skeletal patterning of the growing zebrafish larvae. These findings open a new research avenue to better understand the cellular processes involved in developing, patterning, and maintaining skeletal tissue.",Skeleton; Skeletogenic condensations; Sox9; Notochord; Perichordal bones,2022,232,2-Apr,10.1007/s00427-022-00691-6,0949-944X,13,102,197,1371,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,Analysis of codon usage bias and evolution in the chloroplast genome of Mesona chinensis Benth,"Mesona chinensis Benth (MCB) is one of the main economic crops in tropical and subtropical areas. To understand the codon usage bias (CUB) in M. chinensis Benth, chloroplast genome is essential to study its genetic law, molecular phylogenetic relationships, and exogenous gene expression. Results showed that the GC content of 53 CDS sequences was 37.95\%, and GC1, GC2, and GC3 content were 46.02\%, 38.26\%, and 29.85\%, respectively. The general GC content order was GC1>GC2>GC3. Moreover, the majority of genes had an effective number of codon (ENC) value greater than 40, except ndhE, rps8, and rps18. Correlation analysis results revealed that the GC content was significantly correlated with GC1, GC2, GC3, and ENC. Neutrality plot analysis, ENC-plot analysis, and PR2-plot analysis presented that the CUB of M. chinensis Benth chloroplast genome was mainly affected by mutation and selection. In addition, GGG, GCA, and TCC were found to be the optimal codons. Furthermore, results of cluster analysis and evolutionary tree showed that M. chinensis Benth was closely related to Ocimum basilicum, indicating that there was a certain correlation between the CUB of the chloroplast gene and the genetic relationship of plant species.

DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,Bicaudal C is required for the function of the follicular epithelium during oogenesis in Rhodnius prolixus,"The morphology and physiology of the oogenesis have been well studied in the vector of Chagas disease Rhodnius prolixus. However, the molecular interactions that regulate the process of egg formation, key for the reproductive cycle of the vector, is still largely unknown. In order to understand the molecular and cellular basis of the oogenesis, we examined the function of the gene Bicaudal C (BicC) during oogenesis and early development of R. prolixus. We show that R. prolixus BicC (Rp-BicC) gene is expressed in the germarium, with cytoplasmic distribution, as well as in the follicular epithelium of the developing oocytes. RNAi silencing of Rp-BicC resulted in sterile females that lay few, small, non-viable eggs. The ovaries are reduced in size and show a disarray of the follicular epithelium. This indicates that Rp-BicC has a central role in the regulation of oogenesis. Although the follicular cells are able to form the chorion, the uptake of vitelline by the oocytes is compromised. We show evidence that the polarity of the follicular epithelium and the endocytic pathway, which are crucial for the proper yolk deposition, are affected. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying oocyte development and show that Rp-BicC is important for de developmental of the egg and, therefore, a key player in the reproduction of this insect.",Bicaudal C; Vitellogenesis; Follicular cells; Oogenesis; Embryonic development,2021,231,1-Feb,10.1007/s00427-021-00673-0,0949-944X,16,106,217,1374,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

For instance, in annelids, cellular proliferation, wound healing, and blastema development can be affected when this pathway is disrupted. However, very little is known about the genetic regulatory processes involved in these anomalies. Here, we investigate the morphological effects of 1-azakenpaullone, a pharmacological inhibitor of GSK3 beta that is supposed to over-activate the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, during the anterior and posterior regeneration of the annelid Syllis malaquini. The results showed that high concentrations of 1-azakenpaullone affect the stages of blastema differentiation and resegmentation.

DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,Molecular signatures of selection on the human GLI3 associated central nervous system specific enhancers,"The zinc finger-containing transcription factor Gli3 is a key mediator of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. In vertebrates, Gli3 has widespread expression pattern during early embryonic development. Along the anteroposterior axes of the central nervous system (CNS), dorsoventral neural pattern elaboration is achieved through Hh mediated spatio-temporal deployment of Gli3 transcripts. Previously, we and others uncovered a set of enhancers that mediate many of the known aspects of Gli3 expression during neurogenesis. However, the potential role of Gli3 associated enhancers in trait evolution has not yet received any significant attention. Here, we investigate the evolutionary patterns of Gli3 associated CNS-specific enhancers that have been reported so far. A subset of these enhancers has undergone an accelerated rate of molecular evolution in the human lineage in comparison to other primates/mammals. These fast-evolving enhancers have acquired human-specific changes in transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). These human-unique changes within subset of Gli3 associated CNS-specific enhancers were further validated as single nucleotide polymorphisms through 1000 Genome Project Phase 3 data. This work not only infers the molecular evolutionary patterns of Gli3 associated enhancers but also provides clues for putative genetic basis of the population-specificity of gene expression regulation.",Central nervous system; Gli3; SNPs; Human populations; Positive selection; Transcription factors,2021,231,1-Feb,10.1007/s00427-021-00672-1,0949-944X,14,104,193,1411,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,Morphological changes during the post-embryonic ontogeny of mesothelan spiders and aspects of character evolution in early spiders,"Most morphological studies focus on adult specimens, or if developmental studies are pursued, especially in Euarthropoda, they focus on embryonic development. Araneae (spiders) is one of these groups, in consequence with understudied post-embryonic development. Here we present aspects of the post-embryonic stages of different species of Mesothelae, sister group to the remaining spiders (when fossil species are not taken into account). We used different imaging methods and measured different external morphological structures to detect possible ontogenetic changes. One structure exhibiting post-embryonic changes is the chelicera. Here the significant change occurs between the last immature stage and the adult, yet only in males. For the spinnerets, we could not detect ontogenetic changes, but instead a high variability in length and width, probably due to their lack of pivot joints between the elements. The strongest morphological change during ontogeny occurred on the sternum, which begins with a rather roundish shape in the first stage and changes to being fairly elongate in shape in the last immature stages and the adult. This specific sternum shape only occurs in adults of mesothelan spiders, while opisthothelan spiders have a broader sternum also in the adult. We discuss our results in an evolutionary context, also taking into account recent finds of fossil spiders.",Ryuthela nishihirai; Post-embryonic development; Heterochrony; Sexual dimorphism; Sternum,2021,231,3-Apr,10.1007/s00427-021-00675-y,0949-944X,17,130,207,1391,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,Nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions affect the 5' terminal transcription of mitochondrial genes between the isonuclear CMS line UG93A and its maintainer line UG93B of kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus),"Gene expression and translation in plant mitochondria remain poorly understood due to the complicated transcription of its mRNA. In this study, we report the 5' and 3' RNA extremities and promoters of five mitochondrial genes, atp1, atp4, atp6, atp9, and cox3. The results reveal that four genes (atp1, atp4, atp6, and cox3) are transcribed from multiple initiation sites but with a uniform transcript at the 3' end, indicating that heterogeneity of the 5' end is a common feature in the transcription of kenaf mitochondrial genes. Furthermore, we found that the transcription initiation sites of these four genes are significantly different in UG93A, UG93B, and the F-1 hybrid. These data indicate that nuclear loci and unknown transcription factors within the mitochondria of different cytoplasmic types may be involved in mitochondrial transcription. Promoter architecture analysis showed that the promoter core sequences are conserved in the kenaf mitochondrial genome but are highly divergent, suggesting that these elements are essential for the promoter activity of mitochondrial genes in kenaf. Our results reveal that the heterogeneity of the 5' end and uniformity at the 3' end are common transcriptional features of mitochondrial genes. These data provide essential information for understanding the transcription of mitochondrial genes in kenaf and can be used as a reference for other plants.",Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus); Cytoplasmic male sterility; Circularized RNA (CR)-RT-PCR; 5'-heterogeneity; Transcription terminal,2021,231,5-Jun,10.1007/s00427-021-00682-z,0949-944X,25,190,212,1405,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION,Potential stress tolerance roles of barley germins and GLPs,"Germins and germin-like proteins (GLPs) known as germination markers are encoded by multigene families in several plant species, including barley. To date, functional analysis has revealed germins and GLPs are involved in diverse processes such as embryonic development and stress responses. The aim of this study was the analysis of barley germins and GLPs. In this study, 80 putative germins and GLPs have been identified in barley by using known 17 germins and GLP sequences. Analysis of germins and GLPs showed all germins and GLPs are distributed on all seven chromosomes that most of them spread through chromosome 3, 4 and 7 with 16, 18 and 12 proteins on each, respectively. The protein sizes varied between 185 and 335 amino acids, with an average length of 225 aa. Twelve conserved motifs were found. While germin motifs 1 and 3 were detected in all germins and GLPs, some motifs were found to be related to signalization. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction analysis demonstrated some GLPs are associated with RAB6-interacting golgin, oligopeptide transmembrane transporter activity, beta-glucuronidase activity, protein N-linked glycosylation, multi-pass membrane protein, and proteins containing zinc finger (Znf) domain and RING (really interesting new gene)-type zinc finger domains.

DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,Climate change threatens the future of rain forest ringtail possums by 2050,"Aim The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather escalate the pressure of global warming on biodiversity. Globally, synergistic effects of multiple components of climate change have driven local extinctions and community collapses, raising concern about the irreversible deterioration of ecosystems. Here, we disentangle the pressure of increasing warming and frequency of extreme heatwaves on the population dynamics of tropical ringtail possums (family: Pseudocheiridae). Location The Australian Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. Method Ringtail possums' population dynamics were estimated between 1992 and 2021 using a hierarchical population model that explicitly described the state process and accounted for imperfect detection. Under our model, we propagated the estimated mechanisms governing the system by forecasting ringtails' population dynamics between 2022 and 2050. Derived from this process, we calculated the probability of absolute and quasi-extinction using different population viability thresholds. Results We find a strong negative effect of climate change on population dynamics, particularly extreme heatwaves, resulting in a rapid and severe decline in ringtails' population size in the last three decades.

DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,"Depth and temperature drive patterns of spatial overlap among fish thermal guilds in lakes across Ontario, Canada","AimThe spatial distribution of ectotherms is strongly dependent on the temperature of their environments. In temperate lakes, fishes with different thermal optima can become spatially segregated during summer stratification. This habitat partitioning, or niche complementarity, may play a role in the coexistence of trophically similar species; however, the extent of partitioning is dependent on the resources available within each habitat. Although habitat partitioning of fish thermal guilds has been studied in individual lakes, broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap and segregation are not yet understood. In this study, we explore the patterns and drivers of spatial overlap among thermal guilds (cold-, cool-, and warm-water) at a broad scale.LocationOntario, Canada.MethodsWe built a multivariate regression tree to explore patterns and environmental drivers of spatial overlap in freshwater fishes across three thermal guilds from 438 lakes.ResultsWe identified five clusters of lakes exhibiting different patterns of spatial overlap among the three thermal guilds. Temperature (growing degree days) and maximum lake depth were strong drivers of the spatial overlap patterns.Main ConclusionsThese findings provide a better understanding of broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap and allow us to predict how spatial overlap, and ultimately species interactions and competition, may change under a warming climate.",fish; freshwater; guild; spatial overlap; temperature,2023,29,2,10.1111/ddi.13661,1366-9516,17,113,196,1424,5,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,"Smaller, more diverse and on the way to the top: Rapid community shifts of montane wild bees within an extraordinary hot decade","AimGlobal warming is assumed to restructure mountain insect communities in space and time. Theory and observations along climate gradients predict that insect abundance and richness, especially of small-bodied species, will increase with increasing temperature. However, the specific responses of single species to rising temperatures, such as spatial range shifts, also alter communities, calling for intensive monitoring of real-world communities over time. LocationGerman Alps and pre-alpine forests in south-east Germany. MethodsWe empirically examined the temporal and spatial change in wild bee communities and its drivers along two largely well-protected elevational gradients (alpine grassland vs. pre-alpine forest), each sampled twice within the last decade. ResultsWe detected clear abundance-based upward shifts in bee communities, particularly in cold-adapted bumble bee species, demonstrating the speed with which mobile organisms can respond to climatic changes. Mean annual temperature was identified as the main driver of species richness in both regions. Accordingly, and in large overlap with expectations under climate warming, we detected an increase in bee richness and abundance, and an increase in small-bodied species in low- and mid-elevations along the grassland gradient. Community responses in the pre-alpine forest gradient were only partly consistent with community responses in alpine grasslands. Main ConclusionIn well-protected temperate mountain regions, small-bodied bees may initially profit from warming temperatures, by getting more abundant and diverse. Less severe warming, and differences in habitat openness along the forested gradient, however, might moderate species responses. Our study further highlights the utility of standardized abundance data for revealing rapid changes in bee communities over only one decade.",Alps; altitudinal gradient; body size; climate change; global warming; hymenoptera; pollinator; range shifts,2023,29,2,10.1111/ddi.13658,1366-9516,22,127,252,1863,8,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,Citizen science reveals meteorological determinants of frog calling at a continental scale,"Aim Here we investigate the strength of the relationships between meteorological factors and calling behaviour of 100 Australian frog species using continent-wide citizen science data. First, we use this dataset to quantify the meteorological factors that best predict frog calling. Second, we investigate the strength of interactions among predictor variables. Third, we assess whether frog species cluster into distinct groups based on shared drivers of calling. Location Australia. Method To assess the relationship between calling and meteorological traits, we used spatio-temporal subsampling (daily data fitted to 10 km(2) grid cells) of call and meteorological data as inputs to a boosted regression tree. We scaled the model outputs, which created a descriptive ranking of predictor importance. For strongly day-driven species, we conducted further analyses to examine the influences of meteorological factors within the breeding season. Results We found a strong seasonal signal, with day of year the strongest relationship to calling in 67 out of our 100 species, moderate relationships between temperature and calling, and weak relationships between rainfall and calling. Despite the common narratives, we found that frogs did not group into distinct categories based upon the influence of meteorological factors. For strongly day-driven species, we found similar patterns within the breeding season. Main conclusions We demonstrate the importance of day of year and temperature thresholds in predicting frog calling behaviour in Australia.

DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,Differential response to climate change and human activities in three lineages of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana),"Aim Determining the mechanisms by which climate change and human activities affect patterns of ecological specialization in different genetic units of the same species is crucial for developing local or regionally-based conservation solutions. This study uses species distribution models and genetic analysis to (1) identify the evidence of intraspecific differences in the population size and distribution of the three extant lineages (Sichuan/Gansu (SG), Qinling (QL) and Shennongjia (SNJ)) of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys and (2) determine why some lineages have lower population numbers, a smaller geographical distribution, and are more threatened with extinction. Location China. Methods We used n-dimensional hypervolume modelling and genotype-environment association (GEA) models to compare the climatic niches of three snub-nosed monkey lineages, SDMs to reconstruct the historical, current and future distributions of each lineage and SMC++ to calculate their effective population sizes. Results We found evidence of: (1) climatic niche differentiation among the SG, QL and SNJ lineages of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys; (2) geographical isolation combined with a decrease in population size during the LGM resulted in ecological specialization among these three lineages; and (3) a decline in climatic suitability and anthropogenically driven land conversion, combined with small population size and a narrow distributional range, indicates that the SNJ lineage is at a greater risk of extinction than the SG and QL lineages. Main conclusions We demonstrate that during the LGM a reduction in habitat suitability driven by climate change, in concert with decreasing population size, resulted in the geographical isolation of the three Sichuan snub-nosed monkey subpopulations, leading to lineage differences in ecological specialization. GEA models and hypervolume models demonstrated that the three lineages occupy different ecological niches. Based on lineage-level models, the SNJ and QL lineages should be the immediate focus of conservation efforts due to their small effective population size and expected future reductions in available suitable habitats. The modelling approach used here is robust and can be applied effectively to examine the biogeography, recent evolutionary history and effective population size of other endangered animal taxa.",biogeography; climate change; effective population size; niche comparisons; primate; species distribution models,2022,28,11,10.1111/ddi.13638,1366-9516,17,134,332,2361,6,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,yes,no,yes
DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,Diversity and conservation of endemic true bugs for four family groups in China,"Aim Protected areas (PAs) in China have typically been designed by considering one or several focal taxa (e.g., relict plant and vertebrate species), but the effectiveness of these ``protective umbrellas{''} in safeguarding insects remains unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate the distribution and diversity of endemic true bugs for four family groups (i.e., Miridae, Lygaeoidea, Pentatomidae, and Reduviidae) in China, the environmental factors shaping these diversity patterns, and the effectiveness of China's PAs in safeguarding their diversity. Location China. Methods We mapped the spatial distributions of 1028 endemic true bugs in China using stacked species distribution models and pixel grids of observed points. The environmental factors that influence diversity patterns across China were explored by generalized linear models and random forest models. The effectiveness of PAs in safeguarding species distributions was evaluated by the Zonation platform. Main results We found that most (84.9\%) diversity hotspots for total species were located in mountainous areas of southern China. Additionally, the diversity patterns are shaped by the combined effects of different environmental factors, with the minimum temperature of the coldest month, annual precipitation, and elevation showing the strongest effects. On average, Chinese PAs covered 10.2\% of the distribution areas of these endemic true bugs. Main conclusions In general, our research identifies the important roles of mountainous areas in southern China in maintaining species diversity. Moreover, our research also suggests that PAs in China could not provide sufficient protection for this diversity.

DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,Global impacts of projected climate changes on the extent and aboveground biomass of mangrove forests,"Aim: Over the past 50 years, anthropogenic activities have led to the disappearance of approximately one-third of the world's mangrove forests and their associated ecosystem services. The synergetic combined effect of projected climate change is likely to further impact mangroves in the years to come, whether by range expansions associated with warming at higher latitudes or large-scale diebacks linked to severe droughts. We provide an estimate of future changes in the extent and aboveground biomass (AGB) of mangrove forests at global scales by considering contrasting Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (decade 2090-2100 under RCP 2.6 in line with the Paris Agreement expectations, and RCP 8.5 of higher emissions). Location: Global. Methods: Boosted regression trees fitted occurrence and AGB of mangroves against high-resolution biologically meaningful data on air temperature, precipitation, wave energy, slope and distance to river Deltas. Results: On the global scale, models produced for present-day conditions retrieved high accuracy scores and estimated a total area of 12,780,356 ha and overall biomass of 2.29 Pg, in line with previous estimates. Model projections showed poleward shifts along temperate regions, which translated into comparable gains in total area, regardless of the RCP scenario (area change RCP 2.6: 17.29\%; RCP 8.5: 15.77\%). However, biomass changes were dependent on the emission scenario considered, remaining stable or even increasing under RCP 2.6, or undergoing severe losses across tropical regions under RCP 8.5 (overall biomass change RCP 2.6: 12.97\%; RCP 8.5: -11.51\%). Such losses were particularly aggravated in countries located in the Tropical Atlantic and Eastern Pacific, and the Western and Eastern Indo-Pacific regions (regions with losses above similar to 20\% in overall biomass). Conclusions: Our global estimates highlight the potential effect of future climate changes on mangrove forests and how broad compliance with the Paris Agreement may counteract severe trajectories of loss. The projections made, also provided at the country level, serve as new baselines to evaluate changes in mangrove carbon sequestration and ecosystem services, strongly supporting policy-making and management directives, as well as to guide restoration actions considering potential future changes in niche availability.",aboveground biomass; boosted regression trees; climate change; mangrove forests; Paris agreement; representative concentration pathways,2022,28,11,10.1111/ddi.13631,1366-9516,15,101,339,2377,6,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,yes,no,yes

Due to its decline, fisheries management measures were introduced to prevent further decline and fragmentation of populations. For example, in 2009, a landings prohibition was introduced in the European Union, which banned the retention of common skate onboard commercial fishing vessels with captured individuals to be discarded. We aimed to explore the spatial and temporal population dynamics of the common skate species complex, against the backdrop of changes in fisheries management measures. Location Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Methods We used publicly available fishery-independent trawl survey data from several regions of the Northeast Atlantic shelf to examine trends in incidence and abundance for the common skate species complex. We also constructed a species distribution model to identify changes in the spatio-temporal distribution of the common skate. Results A sustained increase in the common skate species complex was evident in several areas of its distribution. An increase was observed in five separate trawl surveys encompassing distinct regions of its distribution. Despite the observed increase, little evidence of recolonizing previously extirpated areas was evident.

Livni pigs are an indigenous fat-type breed farmed in a single farm in the Orel region and located in the Central European part of the Russian Federation. To determine the genomic regions and genes that are affected by artificial selection, we conducted the comparative study of two pig breeds with different breeding histories and breeding objectives, i.e., the native fat-type Livni and meat-type Duroc breeds using the Porcine GGP HD BeadChip, which contains similar to 80,000 SNPs. To check the Livni pigs for possible admixture, the Landrace and the Large White breeds were included into the study of genetic diversity as these breeds participated in the formation of the Livni pigs. We observed the highest level of genetic diversity in Livni pigs compared to commercial breeds (H-U(E) = 0.409 vs. 0.319-0.359, p < 0.001; A(R) = 1.995 vs. 1.894-1.964, p < 0.001). A slight excess of heterozygotes was found in all of the breeds. We identified 291 candidate genes, which were localized within the regions under putative selection, including 22 and 228 genes, which were specific for Livni and Duroc breeds, respectively, and 41 genes common for both breeds. A detailed analysis of the molecular functions identified the genes, which were related to the formation of meat and fat traits, and adaptation to environmental stress, including extreme temperatures, which were different between breeds.

DIVERSITY-BASEL,Species-Level Versus Community-Level Responses to Microhabitat Type and Diversity in an Experimental Plant Community,"Soil heterogeneity has been theoretically predicted to promote plant performance, but empirical evidence is often mixed. By focusing on a gradient of microhabitats (single, three and six types of microhabitats), we tested the hypothesis that increasing the number of microhabitats promotes the diversity and productivity of plant communities. We created different types of microhabitats by adding different forms of nitrogen (NE4+, NO3- and glycine) or combinations of these nitrogen in an even or patchy way. Community biomass, but not evenness, differed in different types of single-microhabitat. Increasing the number of microhabitat types did not alter community growth or evenness, but it increased the difference in the relative abundance of plant species within the community. These results suggest that microhabitat diversity can influence plant competitive hierarchies, and that this effect can lead to changed community growth, but may not be decisive for plant evenness.",community evenness; productivity; multi-microhabitat; nitrogen forms; plant diversity; soil heterogeneity,2022,14,10,10.3390/d14100803,NA,14,116,143,981,6,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,no,yes,yes

We first held them in a soft-release pasture for 18 months, then partially constrained their movements with drift fences and hazing trials to discourage excursions from a 1200 km(2) target reintroduction zone. Their post-release movements were within 13 km of the soft-release pasture for the first 3 months, but management interventions were needed to keep the animals within 29 km of the release site and inside the reintroduction zone for the remainder of the 3-year study period. Bison exploration was high in the first year but decreased thereafter, as did the size of their annual home range. Step lengths did not decrease but the frequency of ``surge movements{''} (step lengths > 4 km in 2 h) did. Fence visits did not decrease over time but the need to herd/haze the bison from other, unfenced boundary areas did. The reintroduced bison seasonally selected for rugged, high-elevation habitat despite being translocated from a flat landscape. Our results suggest wild bison reintroductions to areas of just a few hundred square kilometres are possible without perimeter fencing, so long as good habitat and management interventions to discourage broad movements are in place.

In many species (Families Calyptraeidae, Cerithiopsidae, Strombidae, Vermetidae, Columbellidae, Nassariidae, Olivellidae, Hermaeidae, Onchidorididae, Gastropteridae, Haminoeidae), the free-swimming veligers were recovered from plankton collections; in Roperia poulsoni (family Muricidae) veligers were usually recovered from egg sacs where they had been retained although some escapees were found in plankton collections; in Pteropurpura festiva (family Muricidae) free-living veligers were also found; and in Atlanta californiensis (family Atlantidae) both veligers and adults were obtained from plankton collections making this a holoplanktonic species. The results confirm that DNA barcoding based on COI gene sequencing is a useful strategy to match life-cycle stages within species as well as to identify species and to document the level of biodiversity within the gastropods.",Mollusks; gastropods; Zooplankton; plankton; COI mitochondrial gene; Pacific Ocean; larvae; DNA barcoding,2022,14,11,10.3390/d14110912,NA,14,111,147,1090,8,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,no,yes,yes
DIVERSITY-BASEL,Composition and Distribution of Plankton Communities in the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean,"In recent decades, the waters off the Antarctic Peninsula and surrounding region have undergone a significant transformation due to global climate change affecting the structure and distribution of pelagic fauna. Here, we present the results of our study on the taxonomic composition and quantitative distribution of plankton communities in Bransfield Strait, Antarctic Sound, the Powell Basin of the Weddell Sea, and the waters off the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands during the austral summer of 2022. A slight warming of the Transitional Zonal Water with Weddell Sea influence (TWW) and an increase in its distribution area was detected. Among the pelagic communities, three groups were found to be the most abundant: copepods Calanoides acutus, Metridia gerlachei, and Oithona spp., salpa Salpa thompsoni, and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Euphausiids were found in cases of low abundance, species diversity, and biomass. In the studied region, an increase in the amount of the salpa S. thompsoni and the euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura and the expansion of their distribution area were observed. Significant structural shifts in phytoplankton communities manifested themselves in changes in the structure of the Antarctic krill forage base. The composition and distribution of pelagic fauna is affected by a combination of environmental abiotic factors, of which water temperature is the main one. The obtained results have allowed us to assume that a further increase in ocean temperature may lead to a reduction in the number and size of the Antarctic krill population and its successive replacement by salps and other euphausiids that are more resistant to temperature fluctuations and water desalination.",thermohaline structure; phytoplankton; macro- and mesozooplankton; ichthyoplankton; abundance; biomass; distribution; Southern Ocean,2022,14,11,10.3390/d14110923,NA,14,97,260,1730,8,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,yes,no,yes
DIVERSITY-BASEL,Stochastic Processes Drive Plant Community Assembly in Alpine Grassland during the Restoration Period,"Enclosure (prohibition of grazing) is an important process to restore alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. However, few studies have quantified the extent to which the long-term enclosure may contribute to the changes in plant phylogenetic diversity and community assembly in alpine grassland under environmental change. In this study, based on an 11-year fencing experiment along an altitudinal gradient ranging from 4400 m to 5200 m in central Tibet, we conducted an observation of species composition and coverage within and outside the fences in the fifth, eighth and eleventh year, and monitored the related climate and soil factors at 7 sites. Our aim is to quantify the relative effects of environmental change and grassland management on the alpine plant community assemblage. The results were: (1) the overall phylogenetic structure (NRI) of the alpine plant communities, whether inside or outside the enclosure, was divergent at altitudes where the environment was relatively unextreme (4800-5100 m), but aggregative at altitudes with low precipitation (4400-4650 m) or with low temperature (5200 m). (2) The phylogenetic structure of the nearest taxon of species (NTI) was more aggregative along the whole gradient. (3) Precipitation was the dominant factor driving the changes in species richness, phylogenetic diversity and community alpha-phylogenetic structure indices (NRI and NTI), followed by enclosure duration and soil C:N ratio. (4) The phylogenetic structure of the communities was similar at higher altitudes under grazing or enclosure treatments, and was opposite at lower sites. Stochastic processes have driven the changes in the communities between inside and outside the fences at all altitudes. In addition, homogeneous dispersal occurred in communities at higher sites. In summary, the 11-year enclosure had little effect on community structure of alpine meadows where the grazing pressure is relative lower, whereas it could help restore the community of steppe meadow at lower altitudes where the grazing pressure is extensively higher. This study may provide a vital theoretical support for the formulation of differential management for alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau.",alpine meadow; community structure; enclosure and grazing; phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity; the Tibetan Plateau,2022,14,10,10.3390/d14100832,NA,13,101,329,2223,5,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,yes,no,yes
DIVERSITY-BASEL,Quantifying the Evolution of Giant Panda Habitats in Sichuan Province under Different Scenarios,"The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a relic species in China and a flagship species in the field of endangered wildlife conservation. The conservation of the giant panda's habitat has gained widespread attention for this reason. Historically, Chinese Giant Panda Nature Reserves are surrounded by communities and the resource utilization behavior of households disturbs the giant panda habitat. Changes in these communities and in Giant Panda Nature Reserves began around 2010, with the feminization and aging of the farm labor force. These changes brought different resource utilization behaviors that led to different evolutionary tendencies in giant panda habitats. This research study assesses the impact of these tendencies based on data from the fourth survey of the giant panda in the Sichuan Province and from geographic information data. The paper aims to uncover the internal mechanisms of farmers' resource utilization behavior in terms of the changes wrought to giant panda habitats. The paper simulates the future habitat of the giant panda based on the LUCC (land use/cover change) model to identify anticipated changes in future landscape patterns and the habitat quality of giant pandas under the current scenarios. The paper analyzes the spatial-temporal change of landscape patterns through the land use transfer matrix, based on the Markov model. The results of the scenario analyses illustrate the spatial and temporal difference in habitat quality. The driving mechanism for landscape pattern change is explored using the logistic regression model. The paper simulates the variation tendency of giant panda habitats under differential labor force structures and resource utilization behavior based on the CA (cellular automata) model, with the robustness of the results verified by participatory experiment. Through four scenarios of simulated farm labor force structure and resource utilization behavior, results suggest that the quality of giant panda habitats in the future will be relatively high when workforce feminization and aging is intense and resource utilization behavior is weakened. The simulated results confirm that the current agricultural labor force structure can reduce the intensity of resource utilization behavior. In this scenario, disturbance to giant panda habitats would decrease and their quality would improve.",structure of the labor force; resource utilization behavior; giant panda habitat; LUCC; landscape pattern,2022,14,10,10.3390/d14100865,NA,13,95,348,2368,5,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,yes,no,yes
DIVERSITY-BASEL,"Reproductive Ecology and Nesting Site Characteristics of Four-Toed Salamanders (Hemidactylium scutatum) in Natural and Constructed Upland-Embedded Wetlands on the Appalachian Plateau, Kentucky","Many forested freshwater wetlands have been altered or destroyed, and wetlands are constructed to offset loss. However, they do not always replace the function of natural wetlands. It is important to understand how features of the habitat differ between types of wetlands and whether constructed wetlands provide an adequate habitat for species adapted to natural wetlands. Our objectives were to measure the characteristics of Four-toed Salamanders' nesting habitat and determine which factors contribute to the abundance of eggs and nests in natural and constructed upland-embedded wetlands within a ridgetop ecosystem in eastern Kentucky. We located and examined characteristics for 207 nests in twelve wetlands and measured variables at the nest level and at the wetland level. The best predictor of the number of eggs and number of nests was amount of moss at the wetland. These measures of reproductive effort were similar between types of wetlands, but the number of eggs per nest was higher in constructed wetlands and inversely related to amount of moss, highlighting a deficit in nesting habitat. Research of embryonic and larval survival is needed but based on data from other amphibian species in this system, we predict that the survival of Four-toed Salamanders' larvae is low in constructed wetlands with permanent hydrology. Restoration of constructed wetlands should address the need for moss as nesting substrate and drying of the wetland to reduce the abundance and diversity of predators of larvae.",Amphibia; management; oviposition; Plethodontidae; reproduction; restoration ecology; wetland construction; wetland ecology,2022,14,11,10.3390/d14110995,NA,22,192,235,1518,8,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,yes,no,yes
DIVERSITY-BASEL,"Investigating the Assemblages of Two Groups of Collembola (Strong Furca and Weak Furca) under Different Agricultural Management Systems, Northeastern China","Agriculture itself has been considered one of the leading reasons for biodiversity loss because of the huge quantity of land dedicated to just this activity, and agricultural intensification has impacted soil organisms at several taxonomic levels. Soil biota is a vital component of the agricultural system, providing essential ecosystem services while also having synergistic impacts on crop yield. Preservation of their diversity becomes a major element of an agricultural sustainability strategy. Many studies focused on agricultural activities' effects on soil organisms, but few of them have focused on their effects on the co-occurrence patterns of their communities. Collembola communities are frequently employed as a substitute for soil organisms; thus, as a surface-dwelling arthropods representative, we investigated assemblages of soil Collembola in reaction to the arrangement of 6 treatments varying in crop rotation (MC: monoculture (corn) vs. CS: corn-soybean rotation) and tillage types (MP: mould ploughing; RT: ridge tillage; and NT: no-tillage). We hypothesized that Collembola communities with strong furca would respond well to the agricultural practices than those with weak furca, and there would be strong co-occurrence between species of Collembola communities belonging to the treatments with less intensity of soil disturbance and more variation in crop rotation. Our study found no clear evidence of a beneficial effect of crop rotation on Collembola communities. Although Collembola with strong furca shows higher abundances in plots with mold plowing, weak furca abundances were not showing any difference (differences in abilities to move fast from harsh habitats could be the reason for different responses of these two groups). Network analysis revealed that Collembola assemblages seem to occur more responsive to tillage intensity than crop rotation. Network graphs of treatments with ridge tillage are significantly more clustered than all others. For the first time, we can show that assemblages of springtails in agriculture were distinguished by a pattern of co-occurrence alongside agricultural practices (crop rotation, soil tillage), showing variations in the disturbance of soil and soil nutrients. Our results, contrary to our expectations, demonstrated that the effects of agricultural activities on Collembola abundance and diversity could be weak after long-term application of the same treatment, but still, they will clearly affect the bonds between Collembola species by affecting their co-occurrence pattern in Collembola communities.",functional trait; tillage type; crop rotation; sustainable agriculture; springtails; network graphs; co-occurrence,2022,14,11,10.3390/d14110994,NA,20,155,370,2586,7,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,yes,no,yes
DIVERSITY-BASEL,"Impacts of Cd Pollution on the Vitality, Anatomy and Physiology of Two Morphologically Different Lichen Species of the Genera Parmotrema and Usnea, Evaluated under Experimental Conditions","The heavy metal Cd accumulates in trophic chains, constituting a toxic element for photosynthesizing organisms, including the algal photobionts of lichen. Thus, as lichens respond differently to heavy metal toxicity, we hypothesized that the species Parmotrema tinctorum and Usnea barbata, commonly sampled in the Cerrado ecoregion, could be sensitive to Cd and, therefore, be used to biomonitor the dispersion of this metal. We also aimed to indicate the responsiveness of biological markers to Cd in these species by exposing the thalli to simulated rainfall with increasing metal concentrations. We observed that both lichen species are responsive to Cd stress; however, different pathways are accessed. The synthesis of carotenoids by P. tinctorum and the production of antioxidant enzymes by U. barbata seem to constitute relevant response strategies to Cd-induced stress. The lichen morphoanatomy, cell viability, photobiont vitality index, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and chlorophyll a synthesis were efficient biomarkers for the effects of increasing Cd exposure in P. tinctorum, being the variables primarily associated with damage to the photobiont. For U. barbata, the lichen morphoanatomy, photochemistry, and antioxidant enzyme activity (catalase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase) were essential to reflect Cd toxicity. However, the species P. tinctorum was characterized as the most sensitive to Cd toxicity, constituting a good bioindicator for the presence of this metal. It can be used in the diagnosis of air quality in urban and industrial areas or even in forest areas influenced by Cd in phosphate fertilizers.",agricultural pollutant; air pollution; heavy metal pollution; mycobiont; photobiont,2022,14,11,10.3390/d14110926,NA,26,187,240,1645,5,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,yes,no,yes
ECOGRAPHY,Rapid recovery of boreal rove beetle (Staphylinidae) assemblages 16 years after variable retention harvest,"Post-harvest recovery of biodiversity is one of important goals in modern forestry. A variable retention (VR) approach has been of particular interest in North America because it promotes rapid faunal recovery, while minimizing negative lasting impacts of logging on the natural fauna. We studied responses of rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) to a broad range of retention harvests (2, 10, 20, 50 and 75\% retention) in comparison to uncut controls as part of the Ecosystem Management Emulating Natural Disturbance (EMEND) experiment in the boreal mixedwood forest of western Canada. We sampled beetles using pitfall traps 1, 2, 11 and 16 years post-harvest in replicated (n=3) stands representing four cover types (deciduous-dominated, deciduous with spruce understory, mixed and coniferous-dominated). We collected 74 263 individuals distributed across 99 species (excluding Aleocharinae). Estimated species richness was highest in clear-cuts until year 11, but by year 16 species richness was similar among treatments. Species composition initially varied strongly in relation to intensity of harvest treatments, but overall variation decreased with time, and by year 16, species composition overlapped among most treatment combinations. Assemblages recovered more quickly in early successional (deciduous-dominated) than in late successional (mixed and conifer-dominated) stands. Overall, our results show that rove beetle assemblages in stands harvested to all VR prescriptions converged more rapidly toward those in fire-origin mature stands than did assemblages in clear-cuts over the first 16 years post-harvest. Thus, it demonstrates that even modest levels of forest retention can facilitate the recovery of staphylinid assemblages in managed landscapes.",biodiversity conservation; boreal mixedwood; EMEND; retention forestry; sustainable forest management,2023,2023,1,10.1111/ecog.06347,0906-7590,14,106,248,1772,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOGRAPHY,Temperature as a likely driver shaping global patterns in mineralogical composition in bryozoans: implications for marine calcifiers under global change,"The Southern Ocean is showing one of the most rapid responses to human-induced global change, thus acting as a sentinel of the effects on marine species and ecosystems. Ocean warming and acidification are already impacting benthic species with carbonate skeletons, but the magnitude of these changes to species and ecosystems remains largely unknown. Here we provide the largest carbonate mineralogical dataset to date for Southern Ocean bryozoans, which are diverse, abundant and important as carbonate producers, thus making them excellent for monitoring the effects of ocean warming and acidification. To improve our understanding of how bryozoans might respond to ocean warming and acidification, we assess latitudinal and seafloor temperature patterns of skeletal mineralogy using bryozoan species occurrences together with temperature data for the first time. Our findings, combining new mineralogical data with published data from warmer regions, show that the proportions of high-Mg calcite and bimineralic species increase significantly towards lower latitudes and with increasing seawater temperature. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that seawater temperature is likely a significant driver of variations in bryozoan mineralogy at a global scale.",acidification; Antarctic; aragonite; calcifying organisms; Mg-calcite; ocean warming,2023,2023,1,10.1111/ecog.06381,0906-7590,20,152,181,1274,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOGRAPHY,"A large-scale assessment of ant diversity across the Brazilian Amazon Basin: integrating geographic, ecological and morphological drivers of sampling bias","Tropical ecosystems are often biodiversity hotspots, and invertebrates represent the main underrepresented component of diversity in large-scale analyses. This problem is partly related to the scarcity of data widely available to conduct these studies and the lack of systematic organization of knowledge about invertebrates' distributions in biodiversity hotspots. Here, we introduce and analyze a comprehensive data compilation of Amazonian ant diversity. Using records from 1817 to 2020 from both published and unpublished sources, we describe the diversity and distribution of ant species in the Brazilian Amazon Basin. Further, using high-definition images and data from taxonomic publications, we build a comprehensive database of morphological traits for the ant species that occur in the region. In total, we recorded 1067 nominal species in the Brazilian Amazon Basin, with sampling locations strongly biased by access routes, urban centers, research institutions and major infrastructure projects. Large areas where ant sampling is non-existent represent about 52\% of the basin and are concentrated mainly in the northern, southeastern and western Brazilian Amazon. We found that distance to roads is the main driver of ant sampling in the Amazon. Contrary to our expectations, morphological traits had lower predictive power in predicting sampling bias than purely geographic variables. However, when geographic predictors were controlled, habitat stratum and traits contribute to explain the remaining variance. More species were recorded in better-sampled areas, but species richness estimation models suggest that areas in southern Amazonian edge forests are associated with especially high species richness.

Here, we use data on a large set of mammal (n = 1225), bird (n = 1829) and tree (n = 341) species to examine the 1) relationship between geographic range size and climatic niche area, 2) influence of species traits on species departures from this relationship and 3) sensitivity of these relationships to how species range size and climatic niche area are estimated. We find positive geographic range size-climatic niche area relationships for all taxa, with residual variation dependent on latitude, and differing from a null model for mammals and birds, but not for trees. Together, we provide support for this general macroecological relationship which is dependent on space, weakly influenced by species traits, and different enough from a null model to suggest that geographic and demographic processes are important.",convex hull; geographic range size; latitudinal gradient; species range estimation,2022,2022,12,10.1111/ecog.06349,0906-7590,15,102,155,997,4,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOGRAPHY,Advancing statistical models to reveal the effect of dissolved oxygen on the spatial distribution of marine taxa using thresholds and a physiologically based index,"The rapid pace of ocean change has prompted a need to forecast likely future species distributions. Species distribution models are often categorized as either correlative (statistical) or mechanistic, and each has limitations both for advancing understanding and for prediction. Here we sought to benefit from mechanistic understanding of how and why low dissolved oxygen affects species' distributions by applying physiologically informed statistical models to the spatial distribution of sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, a deep-dwelling commercially important groundfish. We fit spatial models to trawl-survey data on catch rate, local temperature and dissolved oxygen, and estimated parameters of the metabolic index, which provided a way to express the temperature-dependence of oxygen tolerance. We fit generalized linear mixed effects models with Gaussian random fields to capture the latent spatially fixed variables, and included both linear and breakpoint functions for pO(2) and the metabolic index. The best fitting models all included breakpoint effects of pO(2), and the estimated threshold value of 0.05 atm is close to levels in laboratory studies where metabolism begins to decline. Models based on the metabolic index were not as well supported as those that included pO(2), likely because of the decrease in temperature and slight increase in pO(2) at deep (> 800 m) depths. These findings illustrate that statistical models of species distributions can be improved by incorporating knowledge of how physiological mechanisms operate. Furthermore, they illustrate that even species with high tolerance for low dissolved oxygen may undergo species distribution shifts in the face of growing oxygen depletion in coastal ocean ecosystems.",climate change; distribution shifts; metabolic index; spatial modeling,2022,2022,8,10.1111/ecog.06249,0906-7590,24,163,253,1750,4,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOGRAPHY,Body mass and latitude as global predictors of vertebrate populations exposure to multiple threats,"The interactive effects of multiple threats are one of the main causes of biodiversity loss, yet our understanding of what predisposes species to be impacted by multiple threats remains limited. Here we analyse a global dataset of over 7000 marine, freshwater and terrestrial vertebrate populations, alongside trait, threat and geographical data, to identify the factors influencing the number of threats a species is subjected to at the population level. Out of a suite of predictors tested, we find that body mass and latitude both are broadly available for vertebrate species and influence the number of threats a population is subjected to. Larger-bodied species and those nearer the equator are typically affected by a higher number of threats. However, whilst this pattern broadly holds across ecosystems for most taxa, amphibians and reptiles show opposing trends. We suggest that latitude and body mass should be considered as key predictors to identify which vertebrate populations are likely to be impacted by multiple threats. These general predictors can help to better understand the impacts of the Anthropocene on global vertebrate biodiversity and design effective conservation policies.",conservation; extinction; life history; living planet database; multiple stressors; population dynamics; traits,2022,2022,12,10.1111/ecog.06309,0906-7590,14,98,182,1202,7,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOGRAPHY,Changes in the climate suitability and growth rates of trees in eastern North America,"According to the `fitness-suitability' hypothesis, ongoing changes in climate are expected to affect habitat suitability and hence species' fitness. In trees, differences in fitness may manifest as changes in growth rates, which will alter carbon uptake. Using tree-ring data, we calculated > 1.5 million annual stem growth rate estimates (standardized for tree size) for 15 677 trees representing 37 species from 558 populations throughout eastern North America. We used collections data and species distribution models to estimate each population's climatic suitability from 1900 to 2010. We then assessed the relationships between growth, suitability and time using linear mixed-effects models. We found that stem growth rates decreased significantly through time independent of changes in climate suitability and that relationships between growth rates and climate suitability were highly variable across species. Contrary to expectations, we found that growth rates were negatively correlated with species' climate suitability, a relationship that was consistent over time for gymnosperms and became more negative through time for angiosperms. These results may suggest that stem growth rates are not a good proxy for fitness and/or that unidentified factors may be slowing tree growth and outweighing any potential benefits of climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Regardless of the cause, this finding indicates that we should not count on the increased growth of eastern North American trees to help offset anthropogenic carbon emissions.",CO2 fertilization; dendrochronology; fitness-suitability hypothesis; species distribution models; suitability changes; tree growth rates; tree rings,2022,2022,9,10.1111/ecog.06298,0906-7590,14,85,225,1570,7,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOGRAPHY,Climate-informed models benefit hindcasting but present challenges when forecasting species-habitat associations,"Although species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to hindcast fine-scale population metrics, there remains a paucity of information about how well these models predict future responses to climate. Many conventional SDMs rely on spatially-explicit but time-invariant conditions to quantify species distributions and densities. We compared these status quo `static' models with more climate-informed `dynamic' SDMs to assess whether the addition of time-varying processes would improve hindcast performance and/or forecast skill. Here, we present two groundfish case studies from the Bering Sea - a high latitude system that has recently undergone considerable warming. We relied on conventional statistics (R-2, \% deviance explained, UBRE or GCV) to evaluate hindcast performance for presence-absence, numerical abundance and biomass of arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias and walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus. We then used retrospective skill testing to evaluate near-term forecast skill. Retrospective skill testing enables direct comparisons between forecasts and observations through a process of fitting and forecasting nested submodels within a given time series. We found that the inclusion of time-varying covariates improved hindcasts. However, dynamic models either did not improve or decreased forecast skill relative to static SDMs. This is likely a result of rapidly changing temperatures within the ecosystem, which required models to predict species responses to environmental conditions that were outside the range of observed values. Until additional model development allows for fully dynamic predictions, static model forecasts (or persistence forecasts from dynamic models) may serve as reliable placeholders, especially when anomalous conditions are anticipated. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate support for the use of retrospective skill testing rather than selecting forecast models a priori based on their ability to quantify species-habitat associations in the past.",climate change; forecast skill; generalized additive model; hindcast performance; retrospective skill testing; species distribution model,2022,2022,10,10.1111/ecog.06189,0906-7590,11,112,274,2015,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Although high mountains accounted for less than 0.03\% of the global burned area during 2001-2021, this proportion had more than tripled by 2020.

ECOGRAPHY,Climatic filtering and temporal instability shape the phylogenetic diversity of European alpine floras,"Alpine ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity despite their cold climates. Here we investigate spatial patterns in the phylogenetic diversity (i.e. the degree of species relatedness) of European alpine floras and quantify the influence of climatic conditions since the late Pleistocene and historical climatic instability in shaping these patterns. We collected species-pool data for 22 alpine regions in central and southern Europe and calculated phylogenetic diversity within and between regions using two metrics sensitive to terminal branching in the phylogeny. We regressed phylogenetic diversity against macroclimatic variables representing seasonal extremes between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 000 years BP) and the present at 1000-year intervals. We found the lowest phylogenetic diversity in the Carpathians and the central Alps, and the highest in the north-eastern and southern Iberian Peninsula. Phylogenetic diversity decreased with temperature seasonality and low winter temperature. While the effect of temperature seasonality was relatively constant over time, the influence of winter temperature decreased after the LGM. We also found that phylogenetic diversity decreased with historical climatic instability. Between regions, phylogenetic diversity was mainly explained by current climatic distance rather than geographic distance, suggesting that alpine floras were primarily driven by species sorting along climatic gradients. Our results confirm the role of environmental filtering in shaping the current phylogenetic diversity of alpine floras, resulting in more closely related lineages in regions with relatively cold and unstable climates. We also highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating climatic variation through time to better understand the processes structuring the current biodiversity of alpine floras.",alpine grasslands; angiosperms; high mountains; Holocene; macroecology; Pleistocene,2022,2022,11,10.1111/ecog.06316,0906-7590,13,102,252,1855,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOHYDROLOGY,Does interception evaporation occur from both sides of leaves at the wet Japanese cypress canopy during and after rainfall?,"The interception by the lower (abaxial) side of needle leaves not only contributes to the forest evapotranspiration but will also cause a diffusion barrier of CO2 over the stomata and depresses the plant gas exchange. This study combined the eddy covariance (EC) technique and leaf wetness measurement with a soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) multilayer model to examine the occurrence of interception evaporation from both sides of leaves at a Japanese cypress forest canopy relating to rainfall intensity and different wetting periods. We compared the measured latent heat flux (lambda E) with the simulated wet canopy lambda E with two models that interception evaporation only happens from the upper (adaxial) side of leaves and both sides of leaves. Both models showed a low lambda E during the rainfall as the EC data did. The simulated lambda E at the wet period after rainfall indicates that the interception evaporation from both sides of leaves is more likely to happen after heavy rainfall (>15 mm/12 h). However, for the most frequent small rainfall events (0-5 mm/12 h) at this site, interception evaporation is more likely to occur only from the adaxial side than both sides, which helps the wet leaves to maintain stomata opening and process CO2 uptake after rainfall.",eddy covariance; interception; latent heat flux; leaf wetness; multilayer model,2023,16,2,10.1002/eco.2495,1936-0584,19,123,206,1292,5,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes

We assessed solute transport behaviour in degraded wetland soils using 72 undisturbed soil columns located in Robinia pseudoacacia (tree) and Tamarix chinensis (bush) communities. Soil column tracer experiments were conducted under the same initial and boundary conditions using Brilliant Blue FCF as a conservative tracer. Solute transport behaviour at a soil column scale was described by four measures: steady infiltration rate of effluents, concentration of effluents, dye staining patterns and cumulative effluents leaching. Numerical modelling by the dual-permeability model in HYDRUS-1D was used to simulate the proportion of cumulative effluents leaching from soil macropores. These data showed that steady infiltration rate of effluents at the tree site decreased with increasing soil depth (5.742, 0.716, 0.657, and 0.458 ml/min) but at the bush site first increased and then subsequently decreased with increasing soil depth (0.336, 0.548, 0.974 and 0.379 ml/min). The concentration of effluents at the tree site (0.583, 0.149, 0.147 and 0.067 g/L) and the bush site (0.281, 0.109, 0.161 and 0.053 g/L) decreased nonlinearly with increasing soil depth. Dye staining patterns were significantly different between different soil locations. The largest dark blue staining domains were from 0 to 10 cm soil depths at the tree site and 20-40 cm depths at the bush site. The proportion of cumulative effluents leaching from soil macropores ranged from 37.6\% to 61.1\% at the tree site and ranged from 0\% to 99.9\% at the bush site. Understanding the solute transport behaviour in the Yellow River Delta is the first step towards the restoration of degraded wetlands.",degraded wetland; HYDRUS-1D; soil macropores; solute transport; Yellow River Delta,2023,16,2,10.1002/eco.2501,1936-0584,17,119,279,1860,5,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecologically relevant moisture and temperature metrics for assessing dryland ecosystem dynamics,"In drylands, water-limited regions that cover similar to 40\% of the global land surface, ecosystems are primarily controlled by access to soil moisture and exposure to simultaneously hot and dry conditions. Quantifying ecologically relevant environmental metrics is difficult in drylands because the response of vegetation to moisture and temperature conditions is not easily explained solely by climate-based metrics. To address this knowledge gap, we developed and examined 27 climate and ecological drought metrics across dryland areas of the western United States. Included in the 27 metrics is a suite of 19 largely new ``ecological drought metrics{''} that are designed to quantify multiple aspects of environmental limitation in drylands, including overall growing conditions, seasonal fluctuations, seasonal moisture timing, exposure to extreme drought and recruitment potential for perennial plants. To quantify these metrics, we simulated water balance pools and fluxes of daily soil moisture at multiple depths with historical weather from 1970 to 2010 using the SOILWAT2 ecosystem water balance model. We assessed the relationships among these metrics and their spatial and temporal patterns. We found that the inclusion of ecological drought metrics substantially increased the dimensionality of the climate metrics dataset; the number of independent variables needed to explain 90\% of the variance in the dataset increased with the addition of ecological drought metrics. Spatial patterns in overall growing conditions represented well-known differences among ecoregions, for example, high temperatures and low precipitation in the southwest and cool temperatures and greater precipitation in the northeast. Seasonal fluctuation in soil water availability (SWA) was greatest in the southwest (Mojave Desert), whereas fluctuation in climatic water deficit (CWD) was greatest in the northwest (northern Great Basin and Columbia Plateau). Seasonal timing of moisture also differed among metrics; the timing of wet degree days (WDD), the timing of SWA and the timing of CWD were only weakly related to seasonal timing of precipitation. Plant recruitment metrics varied strongly across western drylands. In the Great Plains, recruitment events occurred more frequently and lasted longer than in the intermountain regions, where recruitment events were comparatively rare and short. These ecological drought metrics provide new insight into patterns of soil moisture and temperature that shape the structure and function of dryland ecosystems. The metrics will be useful for assessing the potential impact of climate change on dryland ecosystems and developing adaptive resource management strategies to sustain dryland ecosystem services in a changing world.",dryland vegetation; ecological drought; hot drought; plant recruitment; soil moisture,2023,16,3,10.1002/eco.2509,1936-0584,11,95,395,2769,5,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
ECOHYDROLOGY,"Functional traits of riparian trees in the lower Fitzroy River, Western Australia","Riparian trees are critically important for maintaining the ecological function of freshwater ecosystems. Globally, anthropogenic changes to water regimes are impacting the health and distribution of riparian trees. Understanding the physiological constraints on the distribution of riparian tree species in relation to the water regime is essential for informed water resource management that seeks to limit impacts on riparian trees. To fill an identified knowledge gap for the Fitzroy River, a significant river in the wet-dry tropics of north-western Australia, we used a trait-based approach to characterise nine common riparian tree species in relation to their distribution along a hydrological gradient. We assessed key functional traits related to drought and flood flows. Leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), foliar carbon content (\% C) and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) are broadly related to plant productivity and durability and may reflect resistance to fluvial stress. Traits related to water availability were stem specific density (SSD), mean xylem vessel diameter and xylem vessel density, as well as foliar delta C-13 which is related to water use efficiency, and leaf osmotic potential at full hydration (pi(100)) as a measure of drought tolerance. We found that pi(100), delta C-13 and SSD values reflected species hydrological habitat preferences, with higher delta C-13 values and lower pi(100) for species distributed in the drier floodplain habitats, compared with species constrained to the riverbank. Low SSD values for species close to the riverbank may be indicative of aerenchyma tissue in response to flooding. Differences in leaf trait values were primarily attributed to differences between evergreen Myrtaceous and deciduous non-Myrtaceous species, rather than hydrological habitat preferences. LMA was greatest for the Myrtaceous study species, with deciduous non-Myrtaceous species associated with wetter habitats having the lowest values. The physiology of riparian trees in northern Australia is not well described for the majority of species. Our study provides insight into plant functional strategies in response to both flooding and drought and is a critical step in understanding plant responses to future water-take scenarios to support evidence-based decision making.",drought stress; flooding; plant functional traits; plant water requirements; tropical rivers,2023,16,1,10.1002/eco.2488,1936-0584,12,81,344,2347,5,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
ECOHYDROLOGY,Habitat response of adult fish species under the influence of ecological flow and hydrodynamic regime in perennial river system,"The escalating anthropogenic activities in recent decades are constantly affecting the aquatic ecology and posing a threat to freshwater species. In this study, a two-dimensional ecohydraulic model and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) coupled framework is employed in the Dikhow River, India, to investigate the favourable habitat condition for the nearly threatened Notopterus chitala fish locally known as Chital fish. The habitat residence suitability and habitat suitability indices are calculated at the observed and ecological flows. The ecological flow rates are computed from flow duration curve shifting and flow duration curve analysis methods. The hydrodynamic computations are carried out using a 1D-2D coupled MIKE FLOOD model. The habitat assessment of the targeted species is carried out by constructing the suitability curves from the computed hydraulic parameters at different environmental management conditions. Results from the habitat assessment curves indicate that the maximum habitat suitability index is found for the targeted fish species at average annual flow. Based on the MCDA analysis, the outer banks of the meander zones are identified as not suitable residence regions for the target species. This study revealed that the coupled approach could be useful to regulate the stream restoration strategies and identify potential habitat preference locations in the domain.",AHP; ecohydraulic; environmental flow; habitat suitability curve; MIKE FLOOD; multiple criteria decision analysis,2023,16,1,10.1002/eco.2481,1936-0584,19,127,203,1411,6,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOHYDROLOGY,Multi-scale analysis for environmental dispersion in wetland flow under the effect of wind,"The present study emphasizes a multi-scale analysis of an environmental dispersionin a fully developed shallow wetland flow under the wind effect, based on the momentum and mass transfer equations. From the classical momentum equation, the depth-dominated velocity profile is derived for the wetland flow. The environmental dispersion is examined using Mei's multi-scale analysis on moment equations of concentration in wetlands with wind-induced effect. Further, the maximum velocity, thickness of separation layer with recirculation and its position are obtained. The increase of depth-averaged velocity was observed for the larger contribution of conveyance capacity in wetland flows for the enhancement of wind direction. Also, the analytical result showed that the higher magnitude of environmental dispersion led to intensive dispersion process for the depth-dominated wetland flow. Moreover, for the hierarchical composition of contaminant constituents, the duration and length of influenced region are associated with a certain standard water quality level in wetland.",environmental dispersion; multi-scale analysis; wetland; wind,2023,16,1,10.1002/eco.2486,1936-0584,13,90,149,1076,4,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOHYDROLOGY,Quantifying evapotranspiration from dominant Arctic vegetation types using lysimeters,"The thermal and hydraulic properties of the moss and organic layer regulate energy fluxes, permafrost stability, and hydrologic function in Arctic tundra. Our goal was to quantify evapotranspiration (ET) from dominant vegetation types in Arctic tundra. We designed and deployed a network of electronic automated weighing micro-lysimeters (n = 58, area = 0.06 m(2)). We selectively clipped groups of plants from a subset of lysimeters to isolate ET from moss, tussocks, and mixed vascular plants. High rates of evaporation (E) recorded during the study period in the moss E lysimeters (64 mm) and high ET in the tussock ET lysimeters (60 mm) show that mosses and sedge tussocks (Eriophorum vaginatum) are the major constituents of local tundra ET. Moss E was consistently higher than ET from mixed vascular species with moss understory indicating that moss E dominates tundra water efflux at sites with moss understory. The ET partitioning presented here will allow for improved prediction of changes in water flux associated with observed and future vegetation change. Future changes in the composition and cover of mosses and vascular plants will not only alter partitioning of tundra ET but may also affect the significant role plants play in the moisture regime and thermodynamics of Arctic permafrost soils.",Arctic; evapotranspiration; lysimeter; moss evaporation; tundra vegetation,2023,16,1,10.1002/eco.2484,1936-0584,9,85,206,1311,5,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOHYDROLOGY,Rainfall interception by common mistletoe (Viscum album L. ssp. album): An additional water loss from infected forests,"Mistletoes have a global distribution and are the largest group of parasitic plants living within the canopies of woody plants. In European forests, Viscum album L. ssp. album (common mistletoe) is a common sight and, despite being considered a pest, can play beneficial roles in the ecosystem. However, mistletoe infections are becoming more severe and widespread throughout Europe, including recent reports of large-scale host tree mortality events. These mortality events are hypothesized to be a result of increased water stresses from severe mistletoe infections in tandem with drought. In this study, we estimate an additional water loss from mistletoe-infected forests that has not yet been described: interception, or the storage and evaporation of rainfall. Results from rainfall simulations on mistletoes sampled from Gostynin Forest District (central Poland) indicate mistletoes can store 0.16-1.32 mm of rainwater. Inputting this additional water storage capacity from mistletoes into a rainfall interception model suggests that, depending on the severity of the infection, mistletoes could reduce annual rainwater supply beneath the canopy by 2-11\%. In forests experiencing water stress from mistletoe infection and climate change, the rainfall interception by mistletoes represents an additional water loss of a magnitude worthy of future investigation.",canopy water storage; evaporation; hemi-parasite; precipitation partitioning; rainfall interception,2023,16,4,10.1002/eco.2485,1936-0584,17,118,196,1368,5,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOHYDROLOGY,Regional-scale partitioning of transmission losses and groundwater recharge using satellite estimates of actual evapotranspiration in an arid environment,"Rivers in arid regions often rely on flow generated from wetter regions upstream, leading to high transmission losses of downstream flows. These transmission losses support a range of ecosystems, but partitioning the volume of the transmission losses across the floodplain, riparian zone and in-channel is difficult. This study presents a methodology relying primarily on multi-decade satellite remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration estimates to partition these losses. The method was applied to the similar to 40,000 km(2) floodplain of Cooper Creek in the central Australian arid zone, where first, the alluvial landscape was classified based on actual evapotranspiration rates, and second, both regional- (i.e., for the entire floodplain) and local-scale (i.e., for each waterhole) water balances were calculated to partition these losses. Regional-scale results estimated that 82\% of transmission losses occurred on the floodplain, 13\% in the riparian zone and 5\% from open water in the river channel and waterholes. These results showed that a refinement of the conceptual model of recharge from the waterholes is necessary as vast areas of the riparian zone are likely to be accessing a shallow freshwater lens rather than a discrete freshwater lens below the permanent waterholes. This method can be used in other data-poor arid river systems as it uses globally accessible data sources.",actual evapotranspiration; Australia; Cooper Creek; groundwater-dependent vegetation; transmission losses,2023,16,1,10.1002/eco.2490,1936-0584,18,153,209,1401,5,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOHYDROLOGY AND HYDROBIOLOGY,"Effect of hydrodynamic conditions on seagrass ecosystems during Cyclone Lehar in the South Andaman Islands, India","The physical disturbances of hydrodynamic conditions in shaping the seagrass meadows were studied in the vicinity of seagrass meadows over the south of Port Blair in the An-daman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) during the lifetime of Cyclone Lehar using spatial and temporal metrological -oceanic parameters and in-situ measurements. A cyclonic depres-sion formed on 23 November 2013 over the west coast of the Malay Peninsula and then transformed into a severe cyclone named Lehar on 25th November 2013. It made its first landfall south of Port Blair in the ANI and caused extensive damage to life and properties. The present study made an attempt to investigate the hydrodynamic condition and their impact on the seagrass meadows during the lifetime of the cyclone. The results revealed that the floristic composition of seagrass species such as Thalassia hemperichii, Halodule pinnifolia and Halodule uninervis was badly damaged due to the effect of the high gra-dient of velocities in the vertical direction, turbulence, high energetic waves, and storm surge. Approximately 32.4\% of the seagrass meadows were uprooted in Haddo Bay and 68\% in Sesostris Bay of the South Andaman Islands. A year after the cyclone passage (De-cember 2014), 13\% (-0.70 ha) of the seagrass meadow in Haddo Bay and 44.5\% (-0.30 ha) of the seagrass in Sesostris Bay had recovered. This study emphasises that the mor-phometric features of the most dominant species, T. hemperichii, were regulated by the physical hydrodynamic mechanisms and led to substantial destruction in the study sites. This study is very useful to understand the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on seagrass ecosystems during a cyclone and brings attention to the real-time monitoring of seagrass ecosystems. Monitoring of the seagrass ecosystem can be further improved by predicting the behavioural dynamics of the marine ecosystem under the various scenarios of extreme weather conditions using high-resolution numerical models. It also helps to determine the appropriate management policy during extreme natural events.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

ECOHYDROLOGY AND HYDROBIOLOGY,Acute toxicity of seven de-icing salts on four zooplankton species- is there an ``eco-friendly{''} alternative?,"While de-icing salts improve safety on roads and sidewalks during winter, they have a neg-ative impact on the environment. This has spurred the search for more environmentally -friendly alternatives. The present study tests the impact of NaCl and six other de-icing salts (pure CaCl2, CaCl2 + NaCl, ``eco-label{''} CaCl2, MgCl2, solid and liquid CH3COOK), promoted as more eco-friendly alternatives to NaCl, on four zooplankton species from biotests: Ceri-odaphnia dubia (Ceriodaphtokit), Daphnia magna (Daphtoxkit), Brachionus calyciflorus (Ro-toxkit) and Thamnocephalus platyurus (Thamnotoxkit). 24-h EC50 evaluation showed that only solid CH3COOK was less toxic for all tested species than NaCl. The other tested de-icing salts had similar or even higher toxicity, with CaCl2, MgCl2 and liquid CH3COOK being significantly more toxic for all species than NaCl. Of the tested species, Thamnocephalus platyurus demonstrated toxicity response at significantly lower concentration of all used de-icing salts, while Daphnia magna had significantly the highest concentrations of toxicity response. Our findings demonstrate that these alternatives are not less toxic in this regard than the commonly-used NaCl and underline the need to verify the accuracy of the term ``eco-friendly{''} on the labels of these products.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

ECOHYDROLOGY AND HYDROBIOLOGY,"Impact of salinity variation and silicate distribution on phytoplankton community composition in Pearl River estuary, China","Monitoring the primary producer diversity is crucial in understanding ecosystems balance, as imbalanced nutrients richness and diversity may induce red tide situations. The present study deals with evaluating the impact of hydrological factors regulating the dynamics of phytoplankton communities and the influence of chemical parameters on phytoplankton growth in Pearl River Estuary (PRE). During wet season (April), around 50 different species of phytoplankton were identified at 14 different sampling sites including 24 diatoms, 9 di-noflagellates, 10 green algae and 6 cyanobacterial species respectively. The diatom Melosira granulate was the dominant species at most of the sampling sites. Phytoplankton surveys during the dry season (November) showed Bellerochea malleus and Skeletonema costatum species as dominant at most of the sampling locations. Silicate (SiO3) distribution was one of the reason for the abundance of diatoms in west shoal sites. The concentration of nu-trients and hydrological factors like water depth and salinity strongly supported phyto-plankton growth. In addition, PRE west and middle shoal sites showed evidence of rich phytoplankton diversity when compared to east shoal and channel sites. The Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis and cluster grouping analysis demonstrated the uniqueness of plankton species diversity at PRE west and east shoal sites.

ECOHYDROLOGY AND HYDROBIOLOGY,Effects of environmental variables on mesozooplankton dynamics in an Amazonian estuary,"In the present study, it was analyzed the structure of mesozooplankton community, and their spatio-temporal variations along the Caete River estuary (northeast of Para, Brazil). Samples were collected during spring tides conducted in nychthemeral cycles, in three fixed sectors located along the studied estuary (inner-S1, middle-S2 and outer-S3), us-ing conical plankton nets of 200 mu m mesh size. Samplings were performed in Septem-ber 2014 (dry season) and March 2015 (rainy season), totaling 54 samples. A total of 25 mesozooplankton species were recorded, being the copepods the most diversified group (21 species), mostly dominated by estuarine and coastal species. The most abun-dant mesozooplankton species presented significantly higher densities ( p < 0.0 0 01) be-tween the middle (Pseudodiaptomus richardi, 583.8 +/- 956.5 ind m -3, Paracalanus quasimodo, 108.9 +/- 181.4 ind m -3 and Pseudodiaptomus acutus, 23.4 +/- 66.6 ind m -3) and outer (Acartia tonsa, 476.9 +/- 1,298.8 ind m -3 and Acartia lilljeborgii (407.9 +/- 1,038.1 ind m -3 and Parasagitta tenuis, 59.9 +/- 117.1 ind m -3) sectors. The non-metric multidimensional ordination analysis highlighted that the average density of the main species varied mainly at a spatial scale, with density increasing toward the mouth of the estuary (except for P. richardi). Spear-man's correlation (rs) demonstrated that the salinity, turbidity, dissolved nutrients and chlorophyll a concentrations were the prevailing environmental variables associated with significant spatial changes of mesozooplankton distribution in this area. Overall, the results showed that spatial variation in the water physicochemical characteristics of the Caete Estuary have significant effects on the structure and succession of the mesozooplankton, which may potentially affect the functioning and biodiversity of this coastal ecosystem.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

ECOHYDROLOGY AND HYDROBIOLOGY,Original Do natural ecosystems differ in terms of some soil physical properties? Savanna vs native grassland,"While numerous studies demonstrated the reduction effect of infiltration changes with natural vegetation conversion to croplands, few information is available examining inher-ent differences between natural ecosystems. We examined the steady state infiltration rate and other topsoil properties in two adjacent native ecosystem types (of the Brazilian trop-ical savanna) occurring under a similar soil type (oxisol), a native grassland and a savanna. We found a significantly higher steady state infiltration rate in the savanna (698 +/- 521 mm h -1) compared to native grassland (413 +/- 181 mm h -1). All soil properties were sig-nificantly different when comparing both ecosystem types indicating that higher topsoil permeability in the savanna is potentially related to higher organic matter content, lower bulk density, and lower penetration resistance.

ECOHYDROLOGY AND HYDROBIOLOGY,Soil erosion progression under rill and gully erosion processes and its effect on variations of mechanisms controlling C mineralization ratio,"The progression of water erosion patterns from rill to gully erosion significantly affects the level of soil aggregate degradation, and thereby stimulates variations in the biochemical mechanisms controlling the OC mineralization ratio. These conditions can affect the exchange of carbon from biosphere to atmosphere. We examined the effect of erosion progression on the physical and biochemical soil properties controlling the C mineralization ratio within the original soils eroded by the rill and gully processes. Aggregate size distribution, geometric mean diameter (GMD), mean weight diameter (MWD), exchangeable cations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial respiration, and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were measured. Despite the greater proportion of the labile components of OC in the rill soils, the C mineralization ratio exhibited lower values in these soils compared with the gully soils. A higher value of GMD, MWD, and exchangeable cations were observed in the rill soils. The results of the stepwise multiple regressions illustrated that the higher C mineralization ratio in the gully soils is significantly positively correlated with DOC and microbial respiration. By contrast, the lower C mineralization ratio in the rill soils was found to be significantly negatively related to the GMD, DOC, and MWD. These variations may be attributed to the effects of the increasing soil aggregate stability on lower vulnerability of labile organic carbon to microbial mineralization. The lower transport capacity of the rill erosion process causes a less loss of SOC and micro-aggregate compared with the gully erosion process. The labile fractions of SOC could bond with clay fractions and exchangeable cations to contribute toward the formation of soil aggregates, encouraging higher resistance of DOC against microbial mineralization in the rill soils. This conceptual approach of combining our field survey data with an empirical model aids in a better understanding of the biochemical mechanisms controlling the C mineralization ratio under the progression of soil erosion.

ECOHYDROLOGY AND HYDROBIOLOGY,Deciduous Shrub Stem Water Content in Arctic Alaska,"Vegetation water content is a critical aspect of ecosystem water balance and plant phys-iology, including how plants cope with drought. Deciduous trees store significant water for use in transpiration throughout the growing season in the boreal forest of Alaska. Wa-ter content of shrub stems, and their role in the water balance, remains unquantified for many woody species in boreal and arctic tundra ecosystems. We adapted time-domain re-flectometry (TDR) to continuously measure shrub water content. We created calibration equations relating apparent dielectric constant to volumetric water content of shrub stems of felt-leaf willow (Salix alaxensis), diamond-leaf willow ( S. pulchra) and dwarf birch (Be-tula nana). Our results show seasonal patterns of volumetric stem water content ranging from 40 to 70\%. Stem water content prior to leaf-out was minimal (scaled by biomass, < 2mm) compared to total snowmelt water, implying little water uptake of snowmelt wa-ter. Stem water content was small compared to other components of the hydrologic water budget (precipitation, runoff, evaporation, evapotranspiration, infiltration), indicating the importance of shrub transpiration and dependence of shrubs on available soil moisture for uptake.

The results showed that soil particle size, soil salinity and pH in Tc, TPa and Ss were greatly changed by fiddler crab activities. The averaged contents of TOC and TN in wetlands with fiddler crab activities (FC) were higher than those in wetlands without fiddler crab activities (CK). The averaged NH4 +-N contents of FC group in Tc, Ss and Sa were 93.42\%, 52.14\% and 20.05\% higher than those of CK group ( p < 0.05), respectively. The averaged NO3 --N contents of Tc and Sa in FC group were 89.79\% and 167.70\% higher than those of CK group ( p < 0.01), respectively. The variation tendency of C/N and C/P in four wetland types were greatly similar with the TOC, and N/P was similar with TN. Multi-ANOVA results showed that soil carbon and nitro-gen were significantly influenced by fiddler crab activities and wetland types ( p < 0.05).

ECOHYDROLOGY AND HYDROBIOLOGY,An approach to discriminating water quality status based on trophic-functional diversity of periphytic protozoan communities in marine ecosystems,"To determine the sensitivity of trophic-functional diversity of periphytic protozoa to envi-ronmental change, a 1-year baseline survey was carried out using glass microscope slides as artificial substrates at four sampling sites along a pollution gradient in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China. Eight trophic-functional groups were identified from 144 observed species based on feeding type and food resource. Results showed that: (1) bacterivores increased, while algivores and non-selectives decreased in abundance with increasing levels of pollution; (2) the trophic-functional pattern of the biofilm-dwelling protozoan communities showed a significant variation among the four sites; and (3) the ellipse test based on paired trophic-functional distinctness indices ( A 9,+ and A,y+) indi-cated a significant departure from an expected trophic-functional pattern in polluted areas.

ECOLOGIA APLICADA,DO IBUPROFEN AND PHENOBARBITAL INFLUENCE DENGUE VECTOR TOLERANCE TO THE LARVICIDE TEMEFOS?,"The release of pharmaceutical products has increased in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, putting the biota at risk, being able to generate multiple impacts on organisms, from modifying enzymatic expression to intergenerational impact on exposed organisms. This study evaluated the influence of phenobarbital and ibuprofen on tolerance to the insecticide temephos in two populations of Aedes aegypti, La Esperanza (LE) and Rockefeller (Rock). Larvae I were exposed to 17.7 mu g/ml ibuprofen and 200 mu g/ml phenobarbital until reaching stage III; subsequently, larvae mortality to temephos (0.005, 0.025 and 0.050 mu g/ml) and the enzymatic activity of esterases were determined. Phenobarbital was found to favors a higher tolerance to 0.025 mu g/ml of temephos, at 24 hours of exposure, in the LE population (44.00 +/- 6.93\% mortality) as opposed to Rock (97.33 +/- 2.67\% mortality); furthermore, it decreased enzymatic activity of alpha esterases in Rock and LE specimens (0.3892 +/- 0.0756 and 0.1722 +/- 0.0194, optical density, respectively). Also, ibuprofen reports a lower LD90 (0.024 mu g/ml temephos) than the control (DL90 = 0.039 mu g/ml temephos) at 2 hours of exposure with temephos. It is concluded that phenobarbital increases the tolerance of Aedes aegypti larvae to temephos, and ibuprofen stimulates the activity of alpha- and beta-esterases.",detoxification; Aedes aegypti; esterases; temephos; tolerance; insecticide; ibuprofen; phenobarbital,2022,21,1,10.21704/rea.v21i1.1874,1726-2216,12,90,206,1364,8,NA,250,15,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGIA APLICADA,SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN THE PROVINCE OF OXAPAMPA/PASCO/PERU,"The sustainability of livestock production systems in the districts of Oxapampa, Chontabamba and Huancabamba Oxapampa, Pasco Region, Peru, were studied. The methodology used was the MESMIS analysis. For the characterization of livestock systems, the producers were grouped into three groups: traditional extensive livestock system, semi-extensive livestock system and extensive livestock system. In the first instance, environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and social sustainability were partially evaluated with their respective indicators, and then evaluated simultaneously in an integrated manner. Through the MESMIS analysis, the traditional extensive livestock system was the most sustainable. Subsequently, the same producers with their environmental, economic and social indicators were subjected to the agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, using as proximity distance the Euclidean distance and with the agglomeration methods: nearest neighbor, nearest neighbor, average or intergroup linkage, bonding intragroup cluster centroid, Ward grouping medium and method with SPSS.

ECOLOGIA APLICADA,BIOCHAR USE IN THE NITROGEN BALANCE IN ALUVIAL SOILS OF SAN RAMON / CHANCHAMAYO / PERU,"In the last decades, the intensive use of nitrogen fertilizers in annual and perennial crops has increased in Peru. These fertilizers are quickly available to plants by converting to nitrates, increasing crop yields. However, nitrogen fertilizers are very volatile and are also lost easily by leaching. This lost nitrogen (N) implies economic costs and leads to environmental problems such as eutrophication. Biochar, a new soil amendment, has been suggested as a solution to these problems; however, there has been little research on the subject in Peru. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of biochar application on corn yield and nitrogen balance in soils (Entisols with alluvial deposition) in San Ramon (Peru). Biochar was produced from green waste and pig manure. The research design considered five treatments: Control (T1), 7 t.ha(-1) of pig manure (T2), 17.5 t.ha(-1) of biochar (T3), 23 t.ha(-1) of biochar with pH adjustment (T4), and 17.5 t.ha(-1) of biochar with pH and C/N ratio adjustment (T5). The results showed that treatments T1 and T2 obtained the lowest corn yields, with an average production of 0.41 t.ha-1 and 2.45 t.ha-1, respectively. Treatment T5 produced the highest corn yield, reaching a production of 5.71 t.ha-1. A significant difference was only found in the yield of treatments T1 and T5 (p = 0.011). Nitrogen use efficiency percentages (NUE), defined as the percentage of applied N that was available to be absorbed by the crop or retained in the soil, were higher for treatments T3, T4, and T5 with 28, 28, and 56\% efficiency, respectively, in comparison to treatments T1 and T2. Likewise, biochar treatments T3, T4, and T5 produced lower nitrogen losses compared to treatments T1 and T2. This research concluded that biochar-based amendments have positive effects on corn crop yield while limiting nitrogen loss.",soil amendment; pig manure; pyrolysis; green waste,2021,20,2,10.21704/rea.v20i2.1808,1726-2216,16,86,299,1869,4,NA,250,15,No,275,225,yes,no,yes

The study area is located at 4 095 meters above sea level, in the Cordillera Blanca peasant community, Ancash Region, Peru. The experimental design was factorial 2 x 2 in blocks, where the factors were: a) two grazing systems P1: Uncontrolled grazing on communal usufruct lands and P2: Rest or total exclusion of grazing, and b) three years of monitoring between 2011 and 2013. At the end of the study, the vegetation structure changed according to the regime of the rangeland use, where the rest favored the increase of native gramineae species and to the detriment of herbs, pseudogramineae, and shrubs. Resting increased the vegetation cover, the accumulation of biomass and mulch on the ground with respect to grazing (P < 0.01). The hydrological function improved with the application of rest compared to grazing, which was reflected in a higher infiltration capacity and soil moisture content (P < 0.01). The ecological processes improved with resting compared to grazing expressed by the increase of the ecological status of the pasture, in response to the improvement of the components that determine its value, such as forage species and vigor (P < 0.01).",rest; continuous grazing; native plants; hydrologic function; ecological status,2021,20,2,10.21704/rea.v20i2.1803,1726-2216,12,87,220,1363,5,NA,250,15,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Satellite greenness and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence reveal reverse desertification in Gurbantunggut Desert,"The desertification reversal is a process of revegetation and natural restoration in fragile dryland areas due to human activities and climate change mediation. Understanding the impact of desertification reversion on terrestrial ecosystems, including vegetation greenness and photosynthetic capacity, is crucial for land policy-making and carbon-cycle model improvement. However, the phenomenon of desertification reversal is rarely mentioned in previous studies, which dramatically limits the understanding of vegetation dynamics in the arid area. Therefore, it is of great necessity to investigate the status of desertification reversal on the ecosystem in arid areas. In this study, we first reported the phenomenon of desertification reversion over the southern edge of the Gurbantunggut Desert through the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer classification map year by year. We discussed the consequences, ways, and causes of desertification reversion. Our results showed that the desertification reversal significantly increased vegetation greenness and photosynthetic capacity, which largely offset the negative impact of desertification on the ecosystem productivity; cropland expansion and grassland's natural restoration were the two main ways of desertification reversal; the improvement of soil-water condition was an essential environmental factor leading to the phenomenon of reverse desertification.

ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Alien insect dispersal mediated by the global movement of commodities,"Globalization and economic growth are recognized as key drivers of biological invasions. Alien species have become a feature of almost every biological community worldwide, and rates of new introductions continue to rise as the movement of people and goods accelerates. Insects are among the most numerous and problematic alien organisms, and are mainly introduced unintentionally with imported cargo or arriving passengers. However, the processes occurring prior to insect introductions remain poorly understood. We used a unique dataset of 1,902,392 border interception records from inspections at air, land, and maritime ports in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Japan, USA, and Canada to identify key commodities associated with insect movement through trade and travel. In total, 8939 species were intercepted, and commodity association data were available for 1242 species recorded between 1960 and 2019. We used rarefaction and extrapolation methods to estimate the total species richness and diversity associated with different commodity types. Plant and wood products were the main commodities associated with insect movement across cargo, passenger baggage, and international mail. Furthermore, certain species were mainly associated with specific commodities within these, and other broad categories. More closely related species tended to share similar commodity associations, but this occurred largely at the genus level rather than within orders or families. These similarities within genera can potentially inform pathway management of new alien species. Combining interception records across regions provides a unique window into the unintentional movement of insects, and provides valuable information on establishment risks associated with different commodity types and pathways.",commodity trade; globalization; human-mediated dispersal; insects; introduction pathways; invasion risk,2022,NA,NA,10.1002/eap.2721,1051-0761,10,69,250,1796,6,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Are we telling the same story? Comparing inferences made from camera trap and telemetry data for wildlife monitoring,"Estimating habitat and spatial associations for wildlife is common across ecological studies and it is well known that individual traits can drive population dynamics and vice versa. Thus, it is commonly assumed that individual- and population-level data should represent the same underlying processes, but few studies have directly compared contemporaneous data representing these different perspectives. We evaluated the circumstances under which data collected from Lagrangian (individual-level) and Eulerian (population-level) perspectives could yield comparable inference to understand how scalable information is from the individual to the population. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) collar (Lagrangian) and camera trap (Eulerian) data for seven species collected simultaneously in eastern Washington (2018-2020) to compare inferences made from different survey perspectives. We fit the respective data streams to resource selection functions (RSFs) and occupancy models and compared estimated habitat- and space-use patterns for each species. Although previous studies have considered whether individual- and population-level data generated comparable information, ours is the first to make this comparison for multiple species simultaneously and to specifically ask whether inferences from the two perspectives differed depending on the focal species. We found general agreement between the predicted spatial distributions for most paired analyses, although specific habitat relationships differed. We hypothesize the discrepancies arose due to differences in statistical power associated with camera and GPS-collar sampling, as well as spatial mismatches in the data. Our research suggests data collected from individual-based sampling methods can capture coarse population-wide patterns for a diversity of species, but results differ when interpreting specific wildlife-habitat relationships.",ecological scaling; Eulerian; individual-based sampling; Lagrangian; location-based sampling; multiple-species; occupancy model; resource selection function; study design,2022,NA,NA,10.1002/eap.2745,1051-0761,18,116,251,1910,9,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Comparative assessment of satellite- and drone-based vegetation indices to predict arthropod biomass in shrub-steppes,"Arthropod biomass is a key element in ecosystem functionality and a basic food item for many species. It must be estimated through traditional costly field sampling, normally at just a few sampling points. Arthropod biomass and plant productivity should be narrowly related because a large majority of arthropods are herbivorous, and others depend on these. Quantifying plant productivity with satellite or aerial vehicle imagery is an easy and fast procedure already tested and implemented in agriculture and field ecology. However, the capability of satellite or aerial vehicle imagery for quantifying arthropod biomass and its relationship with plant productivity has been scarcely addressed. Here, we used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery to establish a relationship between plant productivity and arthropod biomass estimated through ground-truth field sampling in shrub steppes. We UAV-sampled seven plots of 47.6-72.3 ha at a 4-cm pixel resolution, subsequently downscaling spatial resolution to 50 cm resolution. In parallel, we used S2 imagery from the same and other dates and locations at 10-m spatial resolution. We related several vegetation indices (VIs) with arthropod biomass (epigeous, coprophagous, and four functional consumer groups: predatory, detritivore, phytophagous, and diverse) estimated at 41-48 sampling stations for UAV flying plots and in 67-79 sampling stations for S2. VIs derived from UAV were consistently and positively related to all arthropod biomass groups. Three out of seven and six out of seven S2-derived VIs were positively related to epigeous and coprophagous arthropod biomass, respectively. The blue normalized difference VI (BNDVI) and enhanced normalized difference VI (ENDVI) showed consistent and positive relationships with arthropod biomass, regardless of the arthropod group or spatial resolution. Our results showed that UAV and S2-VI imagery data may be viable and cost-efficient alternatives for quantifying arthropod biomass at large scales in shrub steppes. The relationship between VI and arthropod biomass is probably habitat-dependent, so future research should address this relationship and include several habitats to validate VIs as proxies of arthropod biomass.",arthropod biomass; coprophagous arthropods; epigeous arthropods; shrub steppe; vegetation index,2022,32,8,10.1002/eap.2707,1051-0761,14,117,324,2261,5,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Disease and weather induce rapid shifts in a rangeland ecosystem mediated by a keystone species (Cynomys ludovicianus),"Habitat loss and changing climate have direct impacts on native species but can also interact with disease pathogens to influence wildlife communities. In the North American Great Plains, black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) are a keystone species that create important grassland habitat for numerous species and serve as prey for predators, but lethal control driven by agricultural conflict has severely reduced their abundance. Novel disease dynamics caused by epizootic plague (Yersinia pestis) within prairie dog colonies have further reduced prairie dog abundances, in turn destabilizing associated wildlife communities. We capitalized on a natural experiment, collecting data on prairie dog distributions, vegetation structure, avian abundance, and mesocarnivore and ungulate occupancy before (2015-2017) and after (2018-2019) a plague event in northeastern Wyoming, USA. Plague decimated black-tailed prairie dog populations in what was then the largest extant colony complex, reducing colony cover in the focal area from more than 10,000 ha to less than 50 ha. We documented dramatic declines in mesocarnivore occupancy and raptor abundance post-plague, with probability of occupancy or abundance approaching zero in species that rely on prairie dogs for a high proportion of their diet (e.g., ferruginous hawk {[}Buteo regalis], American badger {[}Taxidea taxus], and swift fox {[}Vulpes velox]). Following the plague outbreak, abnormally high precipitation in 2018 hastened vegetation recovery from prairie dog disturbance on colonies in which constant herbivory had formerly maintained shortgrass structure necessary for certain colony-associates. As a result, we observed large shifts in avian communities on former prairie dog colonies, including near-disappearance of mountain plovers (Charadrius montanus) and increases in mid-grass associated songbirds (e.g., lark bunting {[}Calamospiza melanocorys]). Our research highlights how precipitation can interact with disease-induced loss of a keystone species to induce drastic and rapid shifts in wildlife communities. Although grassland taxa have co-evolved with high spatiotemporal variation, fragmentation of the remaining North American rangelands paired with higher-than-historical variability in climate and disease dynamics are likely to destabilize these systems in the future.",disturbance; grassland birds; Great Plains; mesocarnivore; mountain plover; prairie dog; ungulate,2022,NA,NA,10.1002/eap.2712,1051-0761,17,118,321,2361,7,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Feast or famine: How is global change affecting forage supply for Yellowstone's ungulate herds?,"The ecological integrity of US national parks and other protected areas are under threat in the Anthropocene. For Yellowstone National Park (YNP), the impacts that global change has already had on the park's capacity to sustain its large migratory herds of wild ungulates is incompletely understood. Here we examine how two understudied components of global change, the historical increase in atmospheric CO2 and the spread of nonnative, invasive plant species, may have altered the capacity of YNP to provide forage for ungulates over the last 200-plus years. We performed two experiments: (1) a growth chamber study that determined the growth rates of important invasive and native YNP grasses that are forages for ungulates under preindustrial (280 ppm) versus modern (410 ppm) CO2 levels and (2) a field study that compared the effect of defoliation (clipping) on the shoot growth of invasive and native mesic grassland plants under ambient CO2 conditions in 2019. The growth chamber experiment revealed that modern CO2 increased the growth rates of both invasive and native grasses, and invasive grasses grew faster regardless of CO2 conditions. The field results showed a continuum of positive to negative responses of shoot growth to defoliation, with a subgroup of invasive species responding most positively. Altogether the results indicated that the historical increase in CO2 and the spread of invasive species, some of which were planted to provide forage for ungulates in the early and mid-1900s, have likely increased the capacity of forage production in YNP. However, rising CO2 has also resulted in regional warming and increased aridity in YNP, which will likely reduce grassland productivity. The challenge for global change biologists and park managers is to determine how competing components of global change have already affected and will increasingly affect forage dynamics and the sustainability of Yellowstone's iconic ungulate herds in the Anthropocene.",Anthropocene; atmospheric CO2; climate change; grasslands; grazing; herbivory; invasive plants; ungulates; Yellowstone National Park,2022,NA,NA,10.1002/eap.2735,1051-0761,14,95,303,1979,9,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Forest restoration treatments increased growth and did not change survival of ponderosa pines in severe drought, Arizona","We report on survival and growth of ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson \& C. Lawson) 2 decades after forest restoration treatments in the G. A. Pearson Natural Area, northern Arizona. Despite protection from harvest that conserved old trees, a dense forest susceptible to uncharacteristically severe disturbance had developed during more than a century of exclusion of the previous frequent surface-fire regime that ceased upon Euro-American settlement in approximately 1876. Trees were thinned in 1993 to emulate prefire-exclusion forest conditions, accumulated forest floor was removed, and surface fire was re-introduced at 4-years intervals (full restoration). There was also a partial restoration treatment consisting of thinning alone. Compared with untreated controls, mortality of old trees (mean age 243 years, maximum 462 years) differed by <1 tree ha(-1) and old-tree survival was statistically indistinguishable between treatments (90.5\% control, 92.3\% full, 82.6\% partial). Post-treatment growth as measured by basal area increment of both old (pre-1876) and young (post-1876) pines was significantly higher in both treatments than counterpart control trees for more than 2 decades following thinning. Drought meeting the definition of megadrought affected the region almost all the time since the onset of the experiment, including 3 years that were severely dry. Growth of all trees declined in the driest 3 years, but old and young treated trees had significantly less decline. Association of tree growth with temperature (negative correlation) and precipitation (positive correlation) was much weaker in treated trees, indicating that they may experience less growth decline from warmer, drier conditions predicted in future decades. Overall, tree responses after the first 2 decades following treatment suggest that forest restoration treatments have led to substantial, sustained improvement in the growth of old and young ponderosa pines without affecting old-tree survival, thereby improving resilience to a warming climate.",Arizona; dendrochronology; ecological restoration; Pearson natural area; Pinus ponderosa,2022,32,8,10.1002/eap.2717,1051-0761,17,120,296,2067,5,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Integrating invasive species risk assessment into environmental DNA metabarcoding reference libraries,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has shown promise as a tool for estimating biodiversity and early detection of invasive species. In aquatic systems, advantages of this method include the ability to concurrently monitor biodiversity and detect incipient invasions simply through the collection and analysis of water samples. However, depending on the molecular markers chosen for a given study, reference libraries containing target sequences from present species may limit the usefulness of eDNA metabarcoding. To explore the extent of this issue and how it may be resolved to aid biodiversity and invasive species early detection goals, we focus on fishes in the well-studied Laurentian Great Lakes region. First, we provide a synthesis of species currently known from the region and of non-indigenous species identified as threats by international, national, regional, and introduction pathway-specific fish risk assessments. With these species lists, we then evaluate 23 primer pairs commonly used in fish eDNA metabarcoding with available databases of sequence coverage and species specificity. Finally, we identify established and potentially invasive non-indigenous fish that should be prioritized for genetic sequencing to ensure robust eDNA metabarcoding for the region. Our results should increase confidence in using eDNA metabarcoding for fisheries conservation and management in the Great Lakes region and help prioritize reference sequencing efforts. The ultimate utility of eDNA metabarcoding approaches will come when conservation management of existing fish communities is integrated with early detection efforts for invasive species surveillance to assess total fish biodiversity.",early detection; eDNA; Laurentian Great Lakes; non-indigenous species; sequence coverage; species specificity; threatened and endangered species,2022,NA,NA,10.1002/eap.2730,1051-0761,11,101,239,1704,7,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Integration of aerial surveys and resource selection analysis indicates human land use supports boreal deer expansion,"Landscape change is a driver of global biodiversity loss. In the western Nearctic, petroleum exploration and extraction is a major contributor to landscape change, with concomitant effects on large mammal populations. One of those effects is the continued expansion of invasive white-tailed deer populations into the boreal forest, with ramifications for the whole ecosystem. We explored deer resource selection within the oil sands region of the boreal forest using a novel application of aerial ungulate survey (AUS) data. Deer locations from AUS were ``used{'' points and together with randomly allocated ``available{''} points informed deer resource selection in relation to landscape variables in the boreal forest. We created a candidate set of generalized linear models representing competing hypotheses about the role of natural landscape features, forest harvesting, cultivation, roads, and petroleum features. We ranked these in an information-theoretic framework. A combination of natural and anthropogenic landscape features best explained deer resource selection. Deer strongly selected seismic lines and other linear features associated with petroleum exploration and extraction, likely as movement corridors and resource subsidies. Forest harvesting and cultivation, important contributors to expansion in other parts of the white-tailed deer range, were not as important here. Stemming deer expansion to conserve native ungulates and maintain key predator-prey processes will likely require landscape management to restore the widespread linear features crossing the vast oil sands region.",boreal forest; invasive species; landscape change; Odocoileus virginianus; range expansion; ungulate surveys,2022,NA,NA,10.1002/eap.2722,1051-0761,16,117,223,1605,6,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Long-term response of wetland plant communities to management intensity, grazing abandonment, and prescribed fire","Isolated, seasonal wetlands within agricultural landscapes are important ecosystems. However, they are currently experiencing direct and indirect effects of agricultural management surrounding them. Because wetlands provide important ecosystem services, it is crucial to determine how these factors affect ecological communities. Here, we studied the long-term effects of land-use intensification, cattle grazing, prescribed fires, and their interactions on wetland plant diversity, community dynamics, and functional diversity. To do this, we used vegetation and trait data from a 14-year-old experiment on 40 seasonal wetlands located within seminatural and intensively managed pastures in Florida. These wetlands were allocated different grazing and prescribed fire treatments (grazed vs. ungrazed, burned vs. unburned). Our results showed that wetlands within intensively managed pastures have lower native plant diversity, floristic quality, evenness, and higher nonnative species diversity and exhibited the most resource-acquisitive traits. Wetlands embedded in intensively managed pastures were also characterized by lower species turnover over time. We found that 14 years of cattle exclusion reduced species diversity in both pasture management intensities and had no effect on floristic quality. Fenced wetlands exhibited lower functional diversity and experienced a higher rate of community change, both due to an increase in tall, clonal, and palatable grasses. The effects of prescribed fires were often dependent on grazing treatment. For instance, prescribed fires increased functional diversity in fenced wetlands but not in grazed wetlands. Our study suggests that cattle exclusion and prescribed fires are not enough to restore wetlands in intensively managed pastures and further highlights the importance of not converting seminatural pastures to intensively managed pastures. Our study also suggests that grazing levels applied in seminatural pastures maintained high plant diversity and prevented tree and shrub encroachment and that in the absence of grazing, prescribed fire became crucial to maintaining higher species evenness.",coefficient of conservatism; functional dispersion; long-term experiment; management intensification; nonnative species; plant diversity; plant traits,2022,NA,NA,10.1002/eap.2732,1051-0761,14,113,294,2154,7,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Postfire futures in southwestern forests: Climate and landscape influences on trajectories of recovery and conversion,"Southwestern ponderosa pine forests are vulnerable to fire-driven conversion in a warming and drying climate, yet little is known about what kinds of ecological communities may replace them. To characterize postfire vegetation trajectories and their environmental determinants, plant assemblages (361 sample plots including 229 vascular plant species, surveyed in 2017) were sampled within eight burns that occurred between 2000 and 2003. I used nonmetric multidimensional scaling, k-means clustering, principal component analysis, and random forest models to assess relationships between vegetation pattern, topographic and landscape factors, and gridded climate data. I describe seven postfire community types, including regenerating forests of ponderosa pine, aspen, and mixed conifers, shrub-dominated communities of Gambel oak and mixed species, and herb-dominated communities of native bunchgrasses and mixtures of ruderal, native, and nonnative species. Forest recovery was generally associated with cooler, mesic sites in proximity to forested refugia; shifts toward scrub and grassland types were most common in warmer, dryer locations distant from forested refugia. Under future climate scenarios, models project decreases in postfire forest recovery and increases in nonforest vegetation. However, forest to nonforest conversion was partially offset under a scenario of reduced burn severity and increased retention of forested refugia, highlighting important management opportunities. Burning trends in the southwestern United States suggest that postfire vegetation will occupy a growing landscape fraction, compelling renewed management focus on these areas and paradigm shifts that accommodate ecological change. I illustrate how management decisions around resisting, accepting, or directing change could be informed by an understanding of processes and patterns of postfire community variation and likely future trajectories.",climate change; high-severity fire; ponderosa pine; RAD; resilience; resist-accept-direct; succession; vegetation type conversion,2022,NA,NA,10.1002/eap.2725,1051-0761,15,117,259,1942,8,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Rarity begets rarity: Social and environmental drivers of rare organisms in cities,"Cities are sometimes characterized as homogenous with species assemblages composed of abundant, generalist species having similar ecological functions. Under this assumption, rare species, or species observed infrequently, would have especially high conservation value in cities for their potential to increase functional diversity. Management to increase the number of rare species in cities could be an important conservation strategy in a rapidly urbanizing world. However, most studies of species rarity define rarity in relatively pristine environments where human management and disturbance is minimized. We know little about what species are rare, how many species are rare, and what management practices promote rare species in urban environments. Here, we identified which plants and species of birds and bees that control pests and pollinate crops are rare in urban gardens and assessed how social, biophysical factors, and cross-taxonomic comparisons influence rare species richness. We found overwhelming numbers of rare species, with more than 50\% of plants observed classified as rare. Our results highlight the importance of women, older individuals, and gardeners who live closer to garden sites in increasing the number of rare plants within urban areas. Fewer rare plants were found in older gardens and gardens with more bare soil. There were more rare bird species in larger gardens and more rare bee species for which canopy cover was higher. We also found that in some cases, rarity begets rarity, with positive correlations found between the number of rare plants and bee species and between bee and bird species. Overall, our results suggest that urban gardens include a high number of species existing at low frequency and that social and biophysical factors promoting rare, planned biodiversity can cascade down to promote rare, associated biodiversity.",agroecology; biodiversity; ecosystem services; rare species; rarity; socio-ecological systems; urban gardens; urbanization,2022,32,8,10.1002/eap.2708,1051-0761,12,82,282,1880,8,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,Recommendations to enhance breeding bird diversity in managed plantation forests determined using LiDAR,"Widespread afforestation is a crucial component of climate mitigation strategies worldwide. This presents a significant opportunity for biodiversity conservation if forests are appropriately managed. Within forests, structural and habitat diversity are known to be critical for biodiversity but pragmatic management recommendations are lacking. We make a comprehensive assessment of the effects of habitat variables on bird populations using data from over 4000 ha of forested landscape. We combine high-resolution remote sensing data with comprehensive management databases to classify habitat attributes and measure the response of six taxonomic and functional diversity metrics: species richness, Shannon diversity, functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence, and functional dispersion. We use a novel approach that combines hierarchical partitioning analysis with linear models to determine the relative importance of different habitat variables for each bird diversity metric. The age class of forest stands was consistently the most important variable across all bird diversity metrics, outperforming other structural measures such as horizontal and vertical heterogeneity and canopy density. Shrub density and gap fraction were each significantly associated with one bird diversity metric. In contrast, variables describing within-stand structural heterogeneity (vertical and horizontal) were generally less important while tree species identity (e.g., conifer or broadleaved) was not significant for any bird diversity metric. Each of the six bird diversity metrics had different patterns of independent variable importance and significance, emphasizing the need to consider multiple diversity metrics in biodiversity assessments. Similarly, the optimal resolution for remote sensing metrics varied between structural variables and bird diversity metrics, suggesting that the use of remote sensing data in biodiversity studies could be greatly improved by first exploring different resolutions and data aggregations. Based on the results from this comprehensive study, we recommend that managers focus on creating habitat diversity at the between-, rather than exclusively within-stand scale, such as by creating a matrix of different age classes, to maximize bird diversity. This recommendation for forest managers is powerful yet pragmatic in its simplicity.",breeding birds; forest management; forest structure; functional diversity; hierarchical partitioning; LiDAR; remote sensing; species diversity; taxonomic diversity,2022,32,7,10.1002/eap.2678,1051-0761,13,103,322,2389,9,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,A predator-parasitoid mathematical model to describe the biological control of the tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta,"The Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae), or tomato leafminer, is one of the most devastating pests of tomato crops in South America. The use of parasitoids and predators as biocontrol agents of this pest is an alternative to chemical insecticides and an environmentally safe strategy. However, an outcome of a three-way interspecific interaction (pest-parasitoid-predator) may bring surprises. The question is thus how a combination of enemies can contribute most effectively to reduction of the pest density. We examine this using an ordinary differential equations model. The formal and numerical analyses show that the joint use of both biological controls is the best option to decrease the tomato leafminer population, in contrast to the use of each biological control agent separately. Specifically, the numerical results show that in a scenario where the only biological control is given by the parasitoid, the introduction of the predator decreases the adult Tuta population by 28\%, reducing even more the damage caused in tomato crops compared to the use of parasitoid alone.",Trichogramma pretiosum; Macrolophus basicornis; Population dynamics; Equilibrium points; Stability analysis,2022,50,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.100995,1476-945X,15,113,167,1100,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,A suite of ecological indicators for evaluating the integrity of structural eco-complexity in Mexican forests,"This paper presents a conceptual framework for analyzing forest complexity as the combination of the variety of species and key structures that are associated with the composition, structure, and function of forest stands. Several spatial indicators have been developed to characterize the biodiversity, the structural complexity, and anthropogenic effects that can be observed in Mexican forests. By integrating several stand complexity attributes, the forest condition can be characterized as a function of species composition, stand structural attributes, and forest development. In addition, indicators of anthropogenic effects were also analyzed to identify their influence on forest eco-complexity, and therefore, on the current condition of forests. The results of applying this con-ceptual framework showed that Mexican forest are ecologically complex, with varying levels of anthropogenic impacts that modify the structural forest characteristics, particularly in tropical forests. The main factor explaining the current eco-complexity condition in tropical forests was associated with early stages of forest development, due to ecological degradation, and showed a generalized loss of attributes, particularly for stand complexity and stand development. In contrast, temperate forests exhibited better eco-complexity conditions, especially for those attributes that define forest stand occupancy and development. Mining activities, forest extraction as selective harvesting, forest fires, land use change, and road openings are critical human activities that directly affect forest structure and, ultimately, modify forest eco-complexity and integrity. This eco-complexity index derived for Mexican forests can be used to integrate measures of forest structure and func-tioning, and thereby better inform decision making and policy development.",Eco-complexity index; Structural forest complexity; Forest integrity; Human impacts; Mexican forests,2022,50,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.101001,1476-945X,15,109,248,1854,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Alterations in phytotoxicity and allelochemistry in response to intraspecific variation in Parthenium hysterophorus,"Allelopathy plays a crucial role in providing competitive advantage to several alien invasive species, and assists in their establishment beyond native boundaries. Role of allelopathy in the invasion success of the alien weed, Parthenium hysterophorus is well established; however, the ecological and evolutionary factors that could affect its allelopathic interactions are relatively unexplored. In our earlier findings, we suggested the presence of two morphotypes (P-A and P-B) in the population of P. hysterophorus, with variable morphology, physiology, and level of ecological impacts. Here, we hypothesize that phenotypically distinct morphotypes of P. hysterophorus may vary in their phytotoxicity and allelochemistry, thereby producing differential ecological impact. To test this hypothesis, effects of rhizospheric soil (RS) and plant amended soils (PAS) of the two morphotypes of P. hysterophorus (P-A and P-B) were studied on selected dicot (Bidens pilosa and Senna occidentalis) and monocot species (Phalaris minor and Avena fatua). Also, the composition of allelochemicals in P-A and P-B was assessed using Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). The study revealed that the phytotoxic effect of P-B was greater than P-A in all the parameters measured for dicot species and in most of the parameters studied in monocot species. A generalized dose-dependent response was observed in the test species (PAS0 < PAS10 < PAS20 < PAS40) and the effect of RS was comparable to PAS20 and PAS40. A greater number of allelochemicals were reported from P-B, which is in accordance with the growth studies. The study concludes that intraspecific variations account for differential phytotoxicity and allelochemistry in P. hysterophorus.",Allelopathy; Chemotypes; Invasion; LC-MS; Morphotypes; Phenotypic variation; Ragweed parthenium,2022,50,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.100999,1476-945X,13,115,255,1750,7,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Assessing the climate change effects on the distribution pattern of the Azerbaijan Mountain Newt (Neurergus crocatus),"Climate change is a grave danger for humans and a looming threat to Earth's biodiversity in the twenty-first century. Assessing the vulnerability of species to climate change is critical for practical conservation efforts. Due to their limited dispersal ability, amphibians are one of the most vulnerable groups of vertebrates to climate change. Among them, the species that inhabit mountains suffer a tremendous amount of climate change-induced pressures. We, therefore, adopted the Azerbaijan Mountain Newt (Neurergus crocatus), which currently inhabits Northwest Iran, North Iraq, and Southeast Turkey, as a case study for assessing the effects of climate change on the distribution patterns of mountain amphibians. By applying the species distribution models (SDMs) in this study, we tried to hindcast the species distribution area in the past and illustrate the impacts of climate change on its distribution in the present and future (the 2050s and 2070s) climate conditions. Also, the patch metrics have been deployed for identifying habitat fragmentation. Our results indicate a more than 50\% rise in the species' current suitable habitats compared to its glacial refugia. The suitable habitat is expected to gradually decrease in RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. Among the three countries in which the species occurs, its distribution overlaps with protected areas only in Iraq. The number of habitat patches will grow and reach approximately 20 to 60 patches by 2070 and the average area of the patches will decrease throughout this time. Aside from the numerous threats that endanger the species, climate change puts the long-term existence of Azerbaijan Newt in jeopardy. The results of this study stress the urgent need for taking extreme measures on the species management and conserving its remnant habitat patches.",Climate change; Mountain habitats; Protected areas; Amphibians; Habitat fragmentation,2022,50,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.100997,1476-945X,16,117,279,1818,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Drivers of plant individual-based pollinator visitation network topology in an arid ecosystem,"Interactions with pollinators underlie the structure and function of plant communities. Network analysis is a valuable tool for studying plant-pollinator interactions, but these networks are most frequently built by aggregating interactions at the species level. Interactions are between individuals and an advantage of individual based networks is the ability to integrate inter-individual variation in traits and environmental context within complex ecological networks. We studied the influence of inter-individual variation on pollinator sharing among foundation shrubs and cactus in a desert ecosystem using plant individual-based pollinator visitation networks. We hypothesized that the traits that alter attractiveness of plants to pollinators will also influence an individual plant's role within the visitation network. Foundation plants growing with higher densities of nearby blooming shrubs had higher pollinator visitation rates and had greater access to the conspecific mating pool, suggesting widespread and diffuse pollination facilitation within this community. Further, shrub density influenced the role of betweenness centrality and the effective number of partners (eH). Floral display size also influenced the effective number of interaction partners but did not directly influence the centrality measures for individual plants or other measures of network structure despite increasing visitation rates. The individual-based visitation networks were significantly modular and module membership was predicted by species identity and pollinator visitation rates. Ecological and individual context mediate the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions and are fundamental drivers of whole community structure. This study shows that the density of immediate neighbours can influence the overall structure of plant-pollinator interaction networks. Exploring the contribution of intraspecific variation to community interaction networks will improve our understanding of drivers of community-level ecological dynamics.",Centrality; Desert; Pollination; Positive interactions; Network; Non-trophic,2022,50,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.101003,1476-945X,12,93,266,2035,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Fish genomes and their evolution under the influence of ecology,"Environmental interactions and the effects of such interactions on the evolution of genome attributes is an intriguing area of ongoing research. Several earlier studies have delved into how the genome size (GS) and the guanine-cytosine content (GC) of genomes are shaped by species' ecology while largely disregarding other genome attributes, such as number of chromosomes (CR), number of genes (GE), and protein count (PC) from such comparisons. The present study was designed at understanding the influence of ecology-climate, habitat, and depth-on genome attributes by using the most current data on 579 whole fish genomes available at NCBI. Given the diverse and intricate roles of GS and GC in species adaptations to temperature, salinity, and hydrostatic pressure, the focus was on finding if and how the genomes responded to these stressors and if any common patterns existed in the genome-level responses. Our analyses exhibited some significant and intriguing trends for fishes as a whole while indicating strong effects of ecology on GS, GC, CR, and PC. Also, some very unique trends were observed on regressing GS and GC values across temperature, salinity, and depth clines. Accordingly, a very strong decline in the GS and a concomitant increase in GC were observed in species through the tropics/sub tropics to the temperate/poles, from freshwater to the marine habitats, and from the pelagic to bathydemersal depths. Observed patterns strongly support the notion that smaller GS and larger GC are associated with species inhabiting more stable environments and vice versa. The results also signify the effect of these patterns on protein flexibility and its role in tolerating stressful conditions. Observed patterns are discussed in the light of latitudinal biodiversity gradient, habitat complexity, and energy and metabolic expenditure hypothesis.",Climate; Depth; GC content; Genome size; Habitat; Salinity,2022,49,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.100980,1476-945X,10,63,283,1865,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Good predictors for the fixation probability on complex networks of multi-player games using territorial interactions,"In 2012 Broom and Rychtar developed a new framework to consider the evolution of a population over a non-homogeneous underlying structure, where fitness depends upon multiplayer interactions amongst the individuals within the population played in groups of various sizes (including one). This included the independent model, and as a special case the territorial raider model, which has been considered in a series of subsequent papers. Here individuals are based upon the vertex of a graph but move to interact with their neighbours, sometimes meeting in large groups. The most important single property of such populations is the fixation probability, the probability of a single mutant completely replacing the existing population. In a recent paper we considered the fixation probability for the Birth Death Birth (BDB) dynamics for three games, a Public Goods game, the Hawk-Dove game and for fixed fitnesses for a large number of randomly generated graphs, in particular seeing if important underlying graph properties could be used as predictors. We found two good predictors, temperature and mean group size, but some interesting and unusual features for one type of graph, Barabasi-Albert graphs. In this paper we use a regression analysis to investigate (the usual) three alternative evolutionary dynamics (BDD, DBB, DBD) in addition to the original BDB. In particular, we find that the dynamics split into two pairs, BDB/DBD and BDD/DBB, each of which give essentially the same results and found a good fit to the data using a quadratic regression involving the above two variables. Further we find that temperature is the most important predictor for the Hawk-Dove game, whilst for the Public Goods game the group size also plays a key role, and is more important than the temperature for the BDD/DBB dynamics.",Complex networks; Evolutionary graph theory; Fixation probability; Game theory; Territory,2022,51,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.101017,1476-945X,15,117,287,1822,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes

ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Interactions between changes in land cover and potential of ecosystem services in Lithuania at temporal and spatial scale,"The growing interest in ecosystem services is mainly related to land use changes. The aim of the study is to analyse spatial-temporal changes in the capacity to supply of ES in Lithuania based on land use changes in 1990-2018. The results show some balance between loss and gains of ecosystem services capacity due to land use changes. Decrease in heterogenous agricultural areas had negative impact on provision of ecosystem integrity and services. Considerable increase in scrubland and herbaceous vegetation areas significantly increased the ecosystem service potential. The conversion of former agricultural land to less intensively managed ecosystems enhance the potential of valuable habitats for biodiversity and ecosystem services associated with natural grasslands, moors and heathland, transitional woodland shrubs. The urbanization process along with increase in urban fabric areas had little effect on ESs potential since artificial vegetated areas had compensated the loss of ESs due to increased areas of urbanized ecosystems. Despite the area of open spaces slightly increased, this led to decrease of provision of ESs. Temporal changes in overall ESs capacity indicated an increase in Lithuania over the last two decades.

ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Is landscape fragmentation always detrimental for species conservation? The case of the Iberian lynx in central Spain,"The patch-corridor-matrix is the most commonly used model when dealing with landscape characterization studies, but it shows relevant limitations to detect landscape heterogeneity. Other authors have used a functional approach, since it is well known that nutrient, mineral and energy flows exist among ecosystems. These flows can be perceived in boundaries between different landcovers, making possible the identification of spatial units sharing a common pattern of ecological interactions known as mosaics. While the influence of each mosaic over a certain species has been previously addressed, no attention has been given to the intra-mosaic variation. The aim of this research is to assess the influence of functional diversity and connectivity, on the habitat suitability of the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). For this, we built two GLMs to test if these features show a differential effect on lynxes' habitat suitability depending on the mosaic. Both GLMs built show that the influence of these landscape features on lynxes' habitat suitability depends on the landscape spatial organization and landcover composition, suggesting that there is no unique response of a species to changes in landscape diversity and/or connectivity. Thus, we conclude that considering both landscape and species features would allow to a better integration of land management strategies and conservation actions, which could favor species adaptation to highly human-modified landscapes.",Boundary diversity; Connectivity; Habitat suitability; Lynx pardinus; Landscape mosaics,2022,49,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.100985,1476-945X,17,117,215,1473,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Landscape pattern changes across alpine shrub meadows gradient in warm-season pastures on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,"Grassland degradation has been one of the major ecological concerns on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) in recent years, but the degradation of alpine shrub meadows, and in particular the changes in its surface landscape pattern, has been less well assessed. This study selected a warm-season pasture on the QTP as a study area, and used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect aerial photographs along the degradation gradient from late June to early July 2018. We then classified the surface landscape as alpine shrub, alpine meadow, bare soil and plateau pika hole and analyzed the landscape pattern changes at different degradation levels. The results showed that the alpine shrub and alpine meadow dominated landscape degraded to a pattern of alpine meadow and bare soil dominance and pika hole pervasiveness, during which vegetation cover declined and the overall landscape pattern tended to fragment. Landscape pattern characteristics related to the area, density, connectivity and boundaries respond more clearly to the shrub degradation, with moderate degradation being the key stage at which the surface landscape pattern changes dramatically. Our study demonstrates a potential application of UAV technology in the study of grassland degradation. Future research should focus on the status, mechanisms and ecological effects of alpine shrub meadows degradation and the quantitative relationships between surface landscape patterns and ecological functions.",Alpine shrub meadows; Landscape pattern; UAV; degradation gradient; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,2022,49,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.100979,1476-945X,15,115,217,1470,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Loop analysis quantifying human impact in a river ecosystem model,"In ecological systems, multiple interactions connect various kinds of components. Strong and weak as well as positive and negative effects cause complex dynamics and often quite unpredictable processes. Human impact is added to this complexity, with all of its diverse effects. In this paper, we present a case study on the Kelian river ecosystem (Borneo), connecting pristine habitats upstream, a gold mine close to the middle section and human settlements downstream. For six locations, separate food web models had been developed earlier. Here we first analyze the ecological system by loop analysis and compare its outcome for different sites. Second, we identify the most crucial human impacts and implement these in modified loop analysis models. We determine the sign of various effects and study the consistency of human impact on different sites and various organisms. Adding human impact to the models (1) increased the ratio of clear predictions, (2) caused the appearance of ``zero `` predictions in three sites and (3) reduced the variability of predictability along the river.",food web; socio-ecological model; loop analysis; human impact; Kelian river,2022,50,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.101000,1476-945X,10,65,169,1090,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Modelling Holling type II functional response in deterministic and stochastic food chain models with mass conservation,"The Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model is the building block in modeling food chain, food webs and ecosystems. There are a number of hidden assumptions involved in the derivation. For instance the prey population growth is logistic without predation but also with predation. In order to reveal these we will start with modelling a resource-predator-prey system in a closed spatially homogeneous environment. This allows us to keep track of the nutrient flow. With an instantaneous remineralisation of the products excreted in the environment by the populations and dead body mass there is conservation of mass. This allows for a model dimension reduction and yields the mass balance predator-prey model. When furthermore the searching and handling processes are much faster that the population changing rates, the trophic interaction is described by a Holling type II functional response, also assumed in the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. The derivation uses an extended deterministic model with number of searching and handling predators as model variables where the ratio of the predator/prey body masses is used as a mechanistic time-scale parameter. This extended model is also used as a starting point for the derivation of a stochastic model. We will investigate the stochastic effects of random switching between searching and handling of the predators and predator dying. Prey growth by consumption of ambient resources is still deterministic and therefore the stochastic model is hybrid. The transient dynamics is studied by numerical Monte Carlo simulations and also the quasi-equilibrium distribution for the population quantities is calculated. The body mass of the prey individual is the scaling parameter in the stochastic model formulation. This allows for a quantification of the mean-field approximation criterion for the justification of replacement of the stochastic by a deterministic model.",Holling type II; Mass-balance prey-predator model; Predator-prey body size ratio; Stochastic prey-predator model; Rosenzweig-MacArthur model,2022,49,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.100982,1476-945X,16,118,284,1915,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Net ecosystem exchange comparative analysis of the relative influence of recorded variables in well monitored ecosystems,"Weekly averaged datasets from fourteen AmeriFlux ecosystem monitoring sites spread across the Americas, processed to the FLUXNET2015 standard, are statistically evaluated to characterize their seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) trends. The sites cover wetland, cropland, woodland, grassland and tundra ecosystems. Up to twenty measured variables from the sites are variously correlated with NEE. A comparison of Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients reveals that the variables are behaving parametrically with respect to NEE for the wetland, woodland (two out of three sites) and tundra locations, but non-parametrically for cropland and grassland sites. Multi-linear regression (MLR) analysis also distinguishes those ecosystems. MLR predicted versus calculated NEE follow Y asymptotic to X relationships for the wetland and tundra sites, whereas for the other ecosystems the MLR results follow Y \&NOTEQUexpressionL; X trends. Moreover, the coefficient values of the MLR optimum solutions for each ecosystem reveal quite distinct relative influences of the measured variables on the NEE predicted values. These results imply that NEE at wetland and tundra sites can be relatively easily predicted from the FLUXNET2015 set of recorded variables. On the other hand, the other three types of ecosystem sites cannot be easily predicted from those variables, implying that other factors substantially influence NEE at those sites.",Eddy covariance; FLUXNET2015 monitored sites; Correlations; Regression coefficients; Influencing variables; AmeriFlux sites,2022,50,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.100998,1476-945X,16,120,205,1438,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Optimal control of hybrid variable-order fractional coronavirus (2019-nCov) mathematical model; numerical treatments,"A novel coronavirus is a serious global issue and has a negative impact on the economy of Egypt. According to the publicly reported data, the first case of the novel corona virus in Egypt was reported on 14 February 2020. Total of 96753 cases were recorded in Egypt from the beginning of the pandemic until the eighteenth of August, where 96, 581 individuals were Egyptians and 172 were foreigners. Recently, many mathematical models have been considered to better understand coronavirus infection. Most of these models are based on classical integer-order derivatives which can not capture the fading memory and crossover behavior found in many biological phenomena. Therefore, we study the coronavirus disease in this paper by exploring the dynamics of COVID-19 infection using new variable-order fractional derivatives. This paper presents an optimal control problem of the hybrid variable-order fractional model of Coronavirus. The variable-order fractional operator is modified by an auxiliary parameter in order to satisfy the dimensional matching between the both sides of the resultant variable-order fractional equations. Existence, uniqueness, boundedness, positivity, local and global stability of the solutions are proved. Two control variables are considered to reduce the transmission of infection into healthy people. To approximate the new hybrid variable-order operator, Grunwald-Letnikov approximation is used. Finite difference method with a hybrid variable-order operator and generalized fourth order Runge-Kutta method are used to solve the optimality system. Numerical examples and comparative studies for testing the applicability of the utilized methods and to show the simplicity of these approximation approaches are presented. Moreover, by using the proposed methods we can concluded that, the model given in this paper describes well the confirmed real data given by WHO about Egypt.",Caputo proportional constant finite difference method; Hybrid variable-order operator; Coronavirus diseases; Optimal control problems; Generalized fourth order Runge-Kutta method,2022,49,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.100983,1476-945X,12,116,279,1911,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Role of hydrological parameters in the uncertainty in modeled soil organic carbon using a coupled water-carbon cycle model,"Soil organic carbon is the largest carbon pool in the terrestrial biosphere. Large uncertainties exist in the numerical simulations of soil organic carbon due to inaccuracies in their mathematical descriptions of hydrological processes. In this study, the upper limit of uncertainty in modeled soil organic carbon that is induced by hydrological parameter errors, which may stem from measurement or experiential errors, is estimated in China under four different arid and humid conditions. The study was conducted using a conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation related to parameters (CNOP-P) approach and a model of the coupled water-carbon cycle (the Lund Potsdam-Jena Wetland Hydrology and Methane Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, LPJ-WHyMe). Uncertainties in hydrological processes resulted in the largest error (2.73 kg C m(-2) yr(-1), 20.2\%) in the modeled soil organic carbon in the arid and semiarid regions of northern China, with errors of 1.20 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) (6.1\%) in northeastern China, 0.45 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) (3.3\%) in southern China, and -1.71 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) (13.7\%) in the semihumid region of northern China. By analyzing the three components of soil organic carbon, the fast soil carbon pool was found to be the main cause of the uncertainties in modeled soil organic carbon in the four regions of China. Moreover, belowground litter was another cause of the uncertainties in the modeled soil organic carbon in northeastern China and in the semihumid region of northern China. Additional results indicated that the simulation and prediction abilities of soil organic carbon could be improved by reducing parameter errors in hydrological processes through observations or targeted observations. The parameter sensitivity test showed that the benefits to modeling soil organic carbon were similar when reducing the errors in the sensitive hydrological parameter subset, compared to the benefits of reducing the errors in all the hydrological parameters.",CNOP-P; Soil organic carbon; Uncertainty; Sensitivity of parameter combinations,2022,50,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.100986,1476-945X,18,122,299,1981,4,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Socio-ecological contagion in Veganville,"In order to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement for 1.5 C global warming, per capita emissions need to come down to 2.9 tonnes by 2030. Food systems are known to be a significant source of an individual's carbon footprint and demand attention in sustainability management. The objective of this research is to conceptualise and define an intersection between contagion theory and socio-ecological systems models. This is achieved using a population dynamics model between two groups characterised by a distinct food regime: omnivores and vegans. The greenhouse gas emissions of each food regime is used to estimate the city's changing carbon foodprint as the food regimes shift by social contagion. Social contagion is identified as a catalyst for social tipping points, and emission pathways are explored with a variety of different contagion variables to test sensitivity towards a tipping point. The main finding is that the urban carbon foodprint can be reduced significantly with widespread adoption of veganism, but that the foodprint reaches a minimum at 1.97 tonnes CO2-equivalent per capita. This demonstrates the need to embed food demand in urban climate governance such as nudging towards plant-based food alternatives. Nudging is discussed as a lever of ecological importance to social contagion. Lastly, socio-ecological contagion is defined as the interactions between social contagion and damage done to ecological systems to measure peer-to-peer spread of environmental stewardship agendas, such as the journey to Veganville.",NA,2022,51,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.101015,1476-945X,4,40,232,1536,NA,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Structural sensitivity in the functional responses of predator-prey models,"In mathematical modelling, several different functional forms can often be used to fit a data set equally well, especially if the data is sparse. In such cases, these mathematically different but similar looking functional forms are typically considered interchangeable. Recent work, however, shows that similar functional responses may nonetheless result in significantly different bifurcation points for the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey system. Since the bifurcation behaviours include destabilizing oscillations, predicting the occurrence of such behaviours is clearly important. Ecologically, different bifurcation behaviours mean that different predictions may be obtained from the models. These predictions can range from stable coexistence to the extinction of both species, so obtaining more accurate predictions is also clearly important for conservationists. Mathematically, this difference in bifurcation structure given similar functional responses is called structural sensitivity. We extend the existing work to find that the Leslie-Gower-May predator-prey system is also structurally sensitive to the functional response. Using the Rosenzweig-MacArthur and Leslie-Gower-May models, we then aim to determine if there is some way to obtain a functional description of data so that different functional responses yield the same bifurcation structure, i.e., we aim to describe data such that our model is not structurally sensitive. We first add stochasticity to the functional responses and find that better similarity of the resulting bifurcation structures is achieved. Then, we analyse the functional responses using two different methods to determine which part of each function contributes most to the observed bifurcation behaviour. We find that prey densities around the coexistence steady state are most important in defining the functional response. Lastly, we propose a procedure for ecologists and mathematical modellers to increase the accuracy of model predictions in predator-prey systems.",Structural sensitivity; Bifurcation structure; Functional response; Coexistence steady state; Stochasticity; Prey density domain,2022,51,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.101014,1476-945X,9,74,277,2021,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model with virus mutation in a variable population size,"The complex dynamics of a contagious disease in which populations experience horizontal and vertical transmissions, size variation, and virus mutations are of considerable practical and theoretical interest. We model such a system by dividing a population into three distinct groups: susceptibles (S), C-infected (C) and F-infected (F), based on the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model. Once the individuals in the C-infected group recover from the disease, they gain no permanent immunity. The virus can mutate in the group C. When it does, the individuals become members of the F-infected group. The mutated virus causes a lethal and incurable disease with a high mortality rate. We discuss the model for two cases. For the first case, all the newborns from infected mothers develop the disease shortly after their birth. For the second case, there exist equal transmission rates and the C-infected population is lifelong infectious. Our analysis shows that both systems have positive solutions, and the first model possesses four equilibrium points, the trivial one (extinction of the species), C-free equilibrium (extinction of the ancestor virus) and two endemic equilibria of different properties. We identify the net population growth rates of the susceptible and C-infected groups for the existence of the equilibria of the first model. We define the conditions of parameters for which species extinction and endemic equilibria are locally asymptotically stable. We observe that bifurcation occurs at the C-free equilibrium. For the second model, we find that there is only one endemic equilibrium and it is always locally asymptotically stable. We also determine the region for the net population growth rates of the susceptible and F-infected groups for the existence of the endemic equilibrium.",SIS model; Virus mutation; Variable population size; Vertical and horizontal transmission,2022,50,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.101004,1476-945X,11,96,273,1816,4,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes

Our objectives were to analyze its mycorrhizal networks; and, with this data, to identify potential facilitator plants and it's most important mycorrhizal fungal links. This information could be used together in assisted migration programs to connect Abies religiosa saplings to their mycorrhizal network and improve their field establishment. We collected 47 rhizosphere samples from 19 plant species and sequenced their fungal ITS2 region by Illumina. In the whole fungal community, 464 species were mycorrhizal fungi with assigned guild (32\%). In this subset, 85 fungi are arbuscular, 365 ectomycorrhizal and 14 from orchid-mycorriza. The Abies religiosa bipartite network is low nested and highly modular, and has a scale-free architecture. Besides Abies religiosa, the plants with the largest degree and the lowest average shortest path were Salix paradoxa, Muhlenbergia spp., and Baccharis conferta. The most important fungal nodes are species of Cortinarius, Genea, Rhodoscypha, Russula, and Tomentella. We suggest to evaluate the Abies' future establishment in the following scheme: in the first year reintroduce Muhlenbergia spp., and Baccharis conferta, in the second year Salix paradoxa, and in the third year-once the mycorrhizal network is reestablished- Abies religiosa' saplings in close proximity of these plants.

ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,``Perchance to dream?{''}: Assessing the effects of dispersal strategies on the fitness of expanding populations,"Unraveling the patterns of animals' movements is crucial to understanding the basics of biogeography, tracking range shifts resulting from climate change, and predicting and preventing biological invasions. Many researchers have modeled animals' dispersal under the assumptions of various movement strategies, either predetermined or directed by external factors, but none have compared the effects of different movement strategies on population survival and fitness. In this paper, using an agent-based model with a landscape divided into cells of varying quality, we compare the ecological success of three movement and habitat selection strategies (MHSSs): (i) Smart, in which animals choose the locally optimal cell; (ii) Random, in which animals move randomly between cells without taking into account their quality; (iii) Dreamer, in which animals attempt to find a habitat of dream whose quality is much higher than that of the habitat available on the map. We compare the short-term success of these MHSSs in good, medium and bad environments. We also assess the effect of temporal variation of habitat quality (specifically, winter harshness) on the success of each MHSS. Success is measured in terms of survival rate, dispersal distance, accumulated energy and quality of settled habitat. The most general conclusion is that while survival rate, accumulated energy and quality of settled habitat are affected primarily by overall habitat composition (proportions of different habitat types in the landscape), dispersal distance depends mainly on the MHSS. In medium and good environments, the Dreamer strategy is highly successful: it simultaneously outperforms the Smart strategy in dispersal distance and the Random strategy in terms of the other metrics.",Dispersal; Habitat quality; Search strategy; Survival; Population fitness; Levy walk,2022,50,NA,10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.100987,1476-945X,15,112,261,1767,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes

ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,Multi-Dimensional assessment of beach systems on the Catalan coast from a pragmatic and epistemological perspective,"In recent decades, much of the progress observed in the study of beaches to aid policy has focused on producing sound substantive and/or contextual knowledge. However, attention has not usually been paid to the procedural manner in which it has been produced. Guided by an open learning process, this study aims to develop and present an expanded reviewed assessment of the Catalan coast operationalized by means of the Double-Looped Beach Quality Index (DL-BQI). Such openness helps us to understand which narratives of beach management in Catalonia are operating (and which are excluded), the extent to which they are unfolding, and the capacity of the DL-BQI to provide information for policymaking. Data collection enabled assessment of 96 representative beaches on the Catalan coast, that may find correspondence with other geographic locations. Both the instrument used for the assessment - the DL-BQI - and its results were co-evaluated at a multi-stakeholder meeting. In general, beaches have mainly been conditioned to supply elements for tourism and leisure. Different pressures have arisen from the orientation towards such activities, usually according to beach type, most of them negatively impacting the ecological assets and natural heritage of beaches. The economic growth narrative, albeit predominant, was shown to be deficient for tackling complex coastal problems, i.e. intensifying ecological deterioration. Alternatively, the study shows the importance for regional coastal policy of considering the value of beaches as natural systems, as advocated, to a greater or lesser extent, by the narratives of sustainability, environmental protection and integrated coastal zone management.

Grime's CSR strategies were used for grouping plant species into functional types, which were then treated as dependent variables in a time-series analysis. Across four grassland habitat types, there was significant selection against ruderal plant species during the eight-year period. Furthermore, the monitoring data indicated that the decreasing cover of ruderals may, in part be, due to reduced grazing pressure of large herbivores.

In this study, satellite products and terrestrial data were used to detect dust sources in central Iran using remote sensing and machine learning techniques. After recording 890 sites as dust sources based on field surveys and determining 14 independent variables affecting wind erosion and dust sources, dust source distribution maps were prepared through GLM (Generalized Linear Model), CTA (Classifi-cation Tree Analysis), ANN (Artificial Neural Network), MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline), RF (Random Forest), Maxent (Maximum Entropy), and ensemble algorithms. Specifically, 70\% of dust source sites were used as training data and 30\% were used for algorithm performance evaluation through different statistical methods such as partial ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic), sensitivity, specificity, and TSS (True Skill Statistics).

Analogous to arid and semiarid regions of the world, vegetation patterns are characterized by a two-phase mosaic composed of dense vegetation patches interspersed with areas of bare soil, referred to as quasi-circular vegetation patches (QVPs), in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China. However, research on the patch-size distribution of the QVPs reflecting vegetation patterns and ecosystem functioning is lacking. To fill this gap, for the first time, we examined the patch-size distribution of the QVPs using the fused IKONOS high-spatial-resolution image and evaluated the statistical distributions that better fit the patch size data of the QVPs in the YRD. We found that a power law, truncated power law, or lognormal dis-tribution was not supported in the study area, whereas gamma distribution reasonably fits the size data of QVPs, implying that micro-depressions, combined with the water-limited and salinization environments had consid-erable effects on vegetation pattern formation. Our results provide helpful insights and suggest that further studies are needed to classify different types of QVPs. Additionally, more efficient approaches need to be used to fit the statistical distributions for elucidating the spatial vegetation patterns in the YRD.",Quasi -circular vegetation; Patch -size distribution; Power -law distribution; Truncated -power -law distribution; Lognormal distribution; Gamma distribution; Yellow River Delta,2022,71,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101807,1574-9541,13,91,267,1862,7,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Multi-output regression with structurally incomplete target labels: A case study of modelling global vegetation cover,"Weakly-supervised learning has recently emerged in the classification context where true labels are often scarce or unreliable. However, this learning setting has not yet been extensively analyzed for regression problems, which are typical in macroecology. We further define a novel computational setting of structurally noisy and incomplete target labels, which arises, for example, when the multi-output regression task defines a distribution such that outputs must sum up to unity. We propose an algorithmic approach to reduce noise in the target labels and improve predictions. We evaluate this setting with a case study in global vegetation modelling, which in-volves building a model to predict the distribution of vegetation cover from climatic conditions based on global remote sensing data. We compare the performance of the proposed approach to several incomplete target baselines. The results indicate that the error in the targets can be reduced by our proposed partial-imputation algorithm. We conclude that handling structural incompleteness in the target labels instead of using only complete observations for training helps to better capture global associations between vegetation and climate.",Multi -output regression; Compositional data; Incomplete targets; Weakly supervised learning; Vegetation cover modelling,2022,72,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101849,1574-9541,15,117,175,1209,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Quantifying the impacts of opencast mining on vegetation dynamics over eastern India using the long-term Landsat-series satellite dataset,"Enhanced spatio-temporal and up-to-date information on vegetation dynamics at various spatial scales are imperative in understanding the human, biosphere, and atmosphere interactions. Thus, the present study attempts to derive the vegetation greenness trends with the medium spatial resolution (30 m) satellite data at the regional scale with the support of Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The long-term Landsat series satellite dataset was employed to characterize vegetation greenness trends using the Mann-Kendall test over the mining-dominated regions of Eastern India (Jharkhand and Odisha states) for two study periods, viz. earlier (1988-2004) and later (2000-2020). The key findings revealed that -1285 km2 (2.97\%) and 1688 km2 (3.91\%) areas over Jharkhand state and - 5213 km2 (5.68\%) and 2940 km2 (3.20\%) areas over Odisha state showed the negative vegetation greenness trend (indicative of decreasing vegetation activity) during 1988-2004 and 2000-2020, respectively. It was observed that the major anthropogenic activities, particularly opencast mining, are the major factor for vegetation degradation in Jharkhand and Odisha states, contributing to -3-5.7\% vegetation degradation during the study periods. The negative vegetation greenness trend patches were mainly observed in mining sites, settlement encroachments, construction sites, roadways, logging sites, etc. The drastic rise in the intensity of mining activities in the last two decades (2000-2020) has led to massive vegetation destruction compared to the earlier period (1988-2004). Furthermore, the key climatic parameters (i.e., precipitation, temperature, downward radiation, and soil moisture) have less control over the long-term vegetation greenness trends in the mining-dominated regions (- 27\%) in contrast to forest regions (- 47\%). The findings of the study shall be helpful to the policy-makers, stakeholders, environmentalists, and government bodies to formulate and implement various sustainable development programs in the mining-dominated regions to ensure ecological conservation and enhance ecological services.",Mining activity; Vegetation degradation; Landsat; NDVI; Mann-Kendall test,2022,71,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101812,1574-9541,18,137,289,2120,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Quantifying the climate exposure of priority habitat constrained to specific environmental conditions: Boreal aapa mires,"Climate velocity is an increasingly used metric to detect habitats, locations and regions which are exposed to high rates of climate change and displacement. In general, velocities are measured based on the assumption that future climatically similar locations can occur anywhere in the study landscape. However, this assumption can provide a biased basis for habitats which are constrained to specific environmental conditions. For such habitats, a set of selected suitable locations may provide ecologically more realistic velocity measures. Here, we focus on one environmentally constrained habitat, aapa mires, which are peat-accumulating EU Habitats Directive pri-ority habitats, whose ecological conditions and biodiversity values may be jeopardised by climate change. We assess the climate exposure of aapa mires in Finland by developing velocity metrics separately for the whole >= 10 ha aapa mire complexes ('aapa mires') and their wettest flark-dominated parts ('flark fens'). Velocity metrics were developed for six bioclimatic variables (growing degree days (GDD5), mean January and July temperatures, annual precipitation, and May and July water balance, based on climate data for 1981-2010 and for 2040-2069 as derived from global climate models for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). For the six variables, velocities were calculated based on the distance between climatically similar present-day and nearest future mire, divided by the number of years between the two periods, and by excluding the unsuitable matrix. Both aapa mires and flark fens showed high exposure (>5 km/year) to changes in January temperature, and often also considerably high velocities for GDD5 and July temperatures. The flark fens showed significantly higher climate velocities than the aapa mires and had a smaller amount of corresponding habitat in their sur-roundings. Thus, many of the studied mires, particularly the flark fens, are likely to face increased risks of exposure due to changes in winter and summer temperatures. Moreover, considerable changes in precipitation -related conditions may occur at the southern margin of the aapa mire zone. Our results show that specifically tailored climate velocity metrics can provide a useful quantitative tool to inform conservation and management decisions to support the ecosystem sustainability of this EU Habitats Directive biotope and targeting restoration towards the most vulnerable aapa mires.",Climate change velocity; Climate exposure; EU habitats directive; Aapa mire; Peatland conservation; Priority habitat,2022,72,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101828,1574-9541,15,120,359,2475,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Species density per grid cell no longer predicts the local abundance of woody plants,"Species abundance calculated from the number of individuals per hectare in phytosociological surveys is a key parameter to measure plant population size. The species density calculated by the occurrences per grid cell provides a proxy of population size when the species abundance is lacking, but its efficiency as a population parameter is poorly understood. Here, we quantified the species density of 79 woody species of the Cerrado. We tested to what extent species density quantified from grid cells could predict species local abundance. Species density per grid cell was calculated using herbarium data and data from published papers for six spatial reso-lutions, ranging from 30 s to 1 degrees. General additive models and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used to test the species abundance-density relationship. Although we found a correlation between abundance and density, the model fit ranged from poor to moderate. Herbarium and paper data together improved the species abundance-density relationship relative to herbarium data only. Resolutions between 30-min and 1 degrees produced better fits than fine resolution. We concluded that species density per grid cell no longer predicts the local abundance of woody species satisfactorily, multiple data sources are better than a single one, and the coarse resolutions are more suitable for the predicted species abundance-density relationship.",Data void; Conservation strategies; Tree species; Spatial planning; Knowledge gap,2022,72,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101866,1574-9541,14,84,208,1411,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Evaluation of hawthorns maturity level by developing an automated machine learning-based algorithm,"Marketability of agricultural products depends heavily on appearance attributes such as color, size, and ripeness. Sorting plays an important role in increasing marketability by separating crop classes according to appearance attributes, thus reducing waste. As an expert technique, image processing and artificial intelligence (AI) tech-niques have been applied to classify hawthorns based on maturity levels (unripe, ripe, and overripe). A total of 600 hawthorns were categorized by an expert and the images were taken by an imaging box. The geometric properties, color and, texture features were extracted from segmented hawthorns using the Gray Level Co -occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and evaluation of various color spaces. The efficient feature vector was created by QDA feature reduction method and then classified using two classical machine learning algorithms: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The obtained results indicated that the efficient feature-based ANN model with the configuration of 14-10-3 resulted in the accuracy of 99.57, 99.16, and 98.16\% and the least means square error (MSE) of 1 x 10-3, 8 x 10-3, and 3 x 10-3 for training, validation and test phases, respectively.

ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Modelling the recovery of resident shorebirds following a fox eradication program using citizen science data,"Historically, the land-based threat to shorebird colonies on Phillip Island, Victoria, Australia, was fox predation. As a result, a fox eradication programme consisting of three phases: knock-down (i.e., 2006), clean-up (i.e., 2011), and post-eradication. In 2011 an effective knock-down was declared, signalling the beginning of the clean-up phase. The purpose of this research is to assess the recovery of six resident shorebird species on Phillip Island following fox removal. The statistical methodologies used are novel for assessing bird species population recovery following a successful predator eradication program. We used citizen science data from 2003 to 2017, extracted from the Atlas of Living Australia. The first analysis method used INLA modelling, which relied on a Negative Binomial distribution for bird counts to look for upward trends in shorebird populations during the fox eradication operation. The second method use changepoint analysis techniques to see whether successive phases of the eradication process were associated with changes in bird population numbers. Four of the six shorebird species investigated responded positively to reduced fox populations over the 15-year study, and all changepoint approaches consistently recognised the start of the clean-up phase, with less consistency identifying the start of the knock-down phase. Since 2006, the INLA models indicate a significant increase in the upward trend of shorebird populations for three of the six shorebird species investigated. Agreement across the four changepoint techniques indicates that changes in bird numbers were associated with the date of the eradication program's clean-up phase for all of these shorebird species. These results demonstrate some promise for these methods to monitor native species recovery during eradication programs.",Changepoint analysis; INLA; Citizen science; Shorebird; Negative binomial regression,2022,72,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101854,1574-9541,15,108,265,1843,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Instability of remote sensing ecological index and its optimisation for time frequency and scale,"Evaluating regional ecological environmental quality (EEQ) using remote sensing is important for achieving sustainable development. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is a typical EEQ evaluation model used to comprehensively reflect regional ecological quality. However, owing to its complete dependence on remote sensing image information, the RSEI also has inherent issues, including unstable time series and inconsistent resolutions of its four sub-indices. To address these problems, this study used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to propose an optimisation notion for the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) coupled random forest (RF) model and determined the accuracy and image quality of the optimised RSEI (RSEIo) for the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). Based on the findings, HANTS could fill the gaps in the images, effectively reducing the noise and discrete degrees of the four indices and thereby improving the stability of the RSEI. The correlation coefficient (R) between the RSEI and RSEIo was 0.93, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.13, indicating that RSEIo is reliable. The image quality assessment (based on contrast and information entropy) indicates that HANTS combined with the RF model can produce RSEIo images with higher definitions and richer information at a constant spatial resolution. Further, the pixel-by-pixel coefficient of variation evaluation indicates that the RSEIo image was highly stabilised, yielding higher numbers of effective RSEIo images without changing the temporal resolution. Compared with traditional RSEI calculations, the optimisation proposal herein could highlight ecological differences caused by topographic changes in the YRB, which would produce an RSEI closer to actual surface conditions. Further, this proposed method could be used to obtain more detailed ecological information at a constant spatiotemporal resolution, thereby meeting the needs of long-term ecological monitoring in largescale regions.",RSEI; Google Earth Engine; Thermal downscaling; Data reconstruction; Yangtze River Basin,2022,72,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101870,1574-9541,14,96,285,1980,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Detection of citrus black spot disease and ripeness level in orange fruit using learning-to-augment incorporated deep networks,"Fruit infected by pests or diseases and fruit harvests with different levels of ripeness cause a lack of marketability, decrease in economic value, and increase in crop waste. In this study, we propose a robust and generalized deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model via fine-tuning the pre-trained models for detecting black spot disease and ripeness levels in orange fruit. A dataset containing 1896 confirmed orange images in the farm in four classes (unripe, half-ripe, ripe, and infected with black spot disease) was used. In order to prevent overfitting and increase the robustness and generalizability of the model, instead of using fundamental data augmentation techniques, a novel learning-to-augment strategy that creates new data using noisy and restored images was employed. Controllers using the Bayesian optimization algorithm were utilized to select the optimal noise pa-rameters of Gaussian, speckle, Poisson, and salt-and-pepper noise to generate new noisy images. A convolutional autoencoder model was developed to produce newly restored images affected by optimized noise density. The dataset augmented by the best policies of the learning-to-augment strategy was used to fine-tune several pre -trained models (GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ShuffleNet, MobileNetv2, and DenseNet201). The results showed that the learning-to-augment strategy for the fine-tuned ResNet50 achieved the best performance with 99.5\% accuracy, and 100\% F-measure by assigning images infected with black spot disease as the positive class. The proposed automatic disease and fruit quality monitoring technique can be also used for the detection of other diseases in agriculture and forestry.",Orange fruit; Waste management; Machine learning; Data augmentation; Deep learning; Classification,2022,71,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101829,1574-9541,17,126,243,1694,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Fast and accurate mapping of fine scale abundance of a VME in the deep sea with computer vision,"With growing anthropogenic pressure on deep-sea ecosystems, large quantities of data are needed to understand their ecology, monitor changes over time and inform conservation managers. Current methods of image analysis are too slow to meet these requirements. Recently, computer vision has become more accessible to biologists, and could help address this challenge. In this study we demonstrate a method by which non-specialists can train a YOLOV4 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) able to count and measure a single class of objects. We apply CV to the extraction of quantitative data on the density and population size structure of the xenophyophore Syringammina fragilissima, from more than 58,000 images taken by an AUV 1200 m deep in the North-East Atlantic. The workflow developed used open-source tools, cloud-base hardware, and only required a level of experience with CV commonly found among ecologists. The CNN performed well, achieving a recall of 0.84 and precision of 0.91. Individual counts per image and size measurements resulting from model predictions were highly correlated (0.96 and 0.92, respectively) with manually collected data. The analysis could be completed in less than 10 days thus bringing novel insights into the population size structure and fine scale distribution of this Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem. It showed S. fragilissima distribution is patchy. The average density is 2.5 ind.m(-2) but can vary from up to 45 ind.m(-2) only a few tens of meter away from areas where it is almost absent. The average size is 5.5 cm and the largest individuals (>15 cm) tend to be in areas of low density. This study demonstrates how researchers could take advantage of CV to quickly and efficiently generate large quantitative datasets data on benthic ecosystems extent and distribution. This, coupled with the large sampling capacity of AUVs could bypass the bottleneck of image analysis and greatly facilitate future deep-ocean exploration and monitoring. It also illustrates the future potential of these new technologies to meet the goals set by the UN Ocean Decade.",Benthic ecology; Computer vision; Xenophyophores; Quantitative ecology; Mapping; Automated image analysis; Marine conservation,2022,71,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101786,1574-9541,18,95,325,2094,7,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,YOLO-Fish: A robust fish detection model to detect fish in realistic underwater environment,"Over the last few years, several research works have been performed to monitor fish in the underwater environment aimed for marine research, understanding ocean geography, and primarily for sustainable fisheries. Automating fish identification is very helpful, considering the time and cost of the manual process. However, it can be challenging to differentiate fish from the seabed and fish types from each other due to environmental challenges like low illumination, complex background, high variation in luminosity, free movement of fish, and high diversity of fish species. In this paper, we propose YOLO-Fish, a deep learning based fish detection model. We have proposed two models, YOLO-Fish-1 and YOLO-Fish-2. YOLO-Fish-1 enhances YOLOv3 by fixing the issue of upsampling step sizes of to reduce the misdetection of tiny fish. YOLO-Fish-2 further improves the model by adding Spatial Pyramid Pooling to the first model to add the capability to detect fish appearance in those dynamic environments. To test the models, we introduce two datasets: DeepFish and OzFish. The DeepFish dataset contains around 15k bounding box annotations across 4505 images, where images belong to 20 different fish habitats. The OzFish is another dataset comprised of about 43k bounding box annotations of wide varieties of fish across around 1800 images. YOLO-Fishl and YOLO-Fish2 achieved average precision of 76.56\% and 75.70\%, respectively for fish detection in unconstrained real-world marine environments, which is significantly better than YOLOv3. Both of these models are lightweight compared to recent versions of YOLO like YOLOv4, yet the performances are very similar.",Fish detection; Underwater ecosystem; Deep Learning; Object Detection; Dataset,2022,72,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101847,1574-9541,13,91,248,1666,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,A national fish passage barrier inventory to support fish passage policy implementation and estimate river connectivity in New Zealand,"Fragmentation of river systems is a key driver of freshwater biodiversity loss. Instream structure inventories are an essential component of delivering a strategic approach to restoring river connectivity. We used a range of data sources to collate the best available information on fish passage barriers and instream structures across the whole of New Zealand. To support implementation of new national policy objectives to maintain and improve river connectivity, the structure inventory has been integrated with a new fish passage assessment mobile application that allows river managers and asset owners to ground-truth, update and add records to the database. The data are provided open access and are being used for environmental reporting and to support strategic prioritisation of barrier mitigation actions. We used these data to quantify river connectivity at regional and national scales and demonstrated that at least half of New Zealand's river network is upstream of fish migration barriers. Limitations to our calculation of upstream river connectivity included the unknown influence of unrecorded structures, particularly on private land, missing information within recorded data, the large number of instream structures that have been identified but not yet assessed for their risk to fish passage, and spatial errors in the automated pairing of structures to a digital river network. A critical challenge for river managers is understanding the consequences of these uncertainties in the data for prioritisation and decision-making regarding barrier removal or mitigation.",Fish migration; Fragmentation; Fish passage remediation; Prioritisation,2022,71,NA,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101831,1574-9541,19,134,233,1590,4,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Mapping Mediterranean maquis formations using Sentinel-2 time-series,"Maquis, which provides numerous ecosystem services and constitutes an integral part of the Mediterranean ecosystem, is highly heterogeneous. However, despite its importance and heterogeneity, maquis is generally mapped as a single class, while forests are mapped for management purposes. Detailed mapping of the maquis formations is necessary to understand their ecology and manage them sustainably. This study presents a method that generates alliance-level maps of the maquis ecosystems through satellite images using various machine learning techniques with different feature combinations and evaluates the proposed approach in the Mediter-ranean region of Southern Turkey, which has an area of 95,000 km2. Multi-temporal images extract information from vegetation phenology, while topographic and meteorological data are used to improve the classification. Cross-validation is performed using a ground-truth data set of approximately 7500 polygons. Results show that cost-effective and accurate maquis classification at the alliance level is possible using a combination of envi-ronmental features, multi-spectral, and multi-temporal satellite images. Adding environmental features to remotely sensed classification has improved the accuracy by 18\%. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm improves classification accuracy by 7.3\% and 14.6\% relative to Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis algorithms, respectively. With the help of newly introduced features, we have succeeded in mapping 11 alliances with 64.2-82.7\% overall accuracy.

ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,"Conservation prioritization through combined approach of umbrella species selection, occupancy estimation, habitat suitability and connectivity analysis of kingfisher: A study from an internationally important wetland complex (Ramsar site) in India","Assessment of occupancy status, as well as projection of suitable habitats and connectivity of wetland indicator species, and thereby identification of potential conservation umbrella and projection of conservation priority areas are often considered important for wetland conservation. Kingfishers are wetland indicators and suffer from habitat degradation due to world-wide destruction of wetlands. Therefore, they can be considered potential candidates for conservation intervention. The present knowledge about the spatial distribution of suitable areas and habitat connectivity of kingfishers at a landscape level is non-existent. We conducted extensive surveys and recorded four kingfisher species in East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW; Ramsar site No. 1208; similar to 125 km(2)). The occupancy estimates were highest for White-throated kingfisher (Halcyon smyrnensis, WTK), followed by common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis, CK), stork-billed kingfisher (Pelargopsis capensis, SBK) and lowest for pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis, PK). WTK has the highest amount of suitable areas followed by CK, PK and SBK. The spatial overlap of suitable habitats showed that SBK is the potential umbrella species and therefore provides conservation benefits to other kingfisher species and eventually to the EKW. In addition to water areas, emergent vegetation, crop lands and tree cover are other important habitats for kingfishers. The connectivity analyses revealed that suitable habitats were disjunct and are under various anthropogenic threats. Therefore, we need to protect suitable habitats and connectivity between them. Finally, we identified conservation priority areas.

This collaboration relied on the expertise of the Yawuru Country Managers to select specific locations for targeted field surveys and resulted in the confirmation of SHW on the Yawuru IPA for the first time in a decade. Subsequent remote camera trap surveys over a larger area included collaboration with two additional neighbouring Indigenous ranger groups, Karrajarri and Nyikina Mangala. These surveys investigated the spatial and temporal relationship between SHW and other mammals which may threaten (e.g., feral Cat {[}Felis catus], Dingo [}Canis familiaris dingo]) or compete (e.g., Agile Wallaby {[}Macropus agilis]; Cattle {[}Bos taurus]) with them. We found a negative relationship between SHW and cat activity, suggesting that cats may limit the activity or abundance of SHW. Temporal portioning was evident between SHW and both Cattle and Agile Wallaby suggesting that SHW may avoid times when these species are most active. Further, we found a negative relationship between SHW occurrence and distance to fire scar edge burnt in current or previous fire season. This edge habitat is likely important to SHW because they may require recently burnt areas to forage and dense unburnt areas to shelter.

ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION,Djaara cultural authority drives inclusion of their knowledge and culture in a Joint Management Plan for parks,"Six parks in central Victoria were handed back to ownership of Dja Dja Wurrung People (Djaara) as part of the Recognition and Settlement Agreement 2013 with the State of Victoria. Dhelkunya Dja Land Management Board (DDLMB) developed a Joint Management Plan (JMP) for these parks, which was approved under Victorian legislation and launched in October 2018. Here, we show how and why Djaara used their cultural authority to ensure their knowledge, and culture was incorporated into the JMP. Djaara's cultural authority produced significant innovations. First, the unique Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) processes implemented by the Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation (DDWCAC) for the DDLMB ensured that shared governance and decision-making underpinned joint management. Second, the participatory Healthy Country Planning approach enabled greater equity, including a unique 3-day `Map-a-Thon' that integrated cultural and natural spatial data. Third, the challenge of achieving power-shifting from the government to the Djaara was addressed through a relationship-based approach, supported by systematic, evidence-based planning.

ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION,"Empowering young Aboriginal women to care for Country: Case study of the Ngukurr Yangbala rangers, remote northern Australia","Globally, the role of women in conservation is gaining attention with increasing initiatives to support gender equity in environmental management and decision-making. In Australia, the role of Aboriginal women in natural and cultural resource management employed as rangers is also gaining recognition; however, female employment in this field remains underrepresented. This paper reflects on a cross-cultural partnership aimed at empowering young Aboriginal women in natural and cultural resource management, locally known as caring for Country, in Arnhem Land, a remote Aboriginal owned region of northern Australia. The project was led by local Ngukurr community Ngandi Elder and lead author, Mrs Daniels, and Macquarie University researchers who co-designed and co-delivered activities according to five project aims: (i) Community involvement; (ii) Biocultural research / learning on Country; (iii) Leadership and confidence building; (iv) Knowledge maintenance; and (v) Capacity building. Over three years of the project, over 60 youth participated in a range of on-Country and cultural learning, leadership and capacity building activities including cross-cultural biodiversity surveys, wetland monitoring, traditional language and knowledge recording and culture camps. Participant feedback and a biocultural learning assessment task noted growth in confidence, biocultural knowledge and desire for continuation of youth empowerment programs in conservation. To facilitate gender equity in Aboriginal natural and cultural resource management, structural and sustained support of women's empowerment and leadership, driven by local women with support of local communities, is required.",Aboriginal-led; biocultural research; caring for Country; co-design; gender in conservation; youth,2022,23,1,10.1111/emr.12538,1442-7001,18,124,229,1692,6,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION,Evaluating methods for controlling feral cats that minimise non-target impacts at Taunton National Park (Scientific),"Feral Cat (Felis catus) (cat) is a predator of the Bridled Nail-Tailed Wallaby (BNTW) (Onychogalea frenata) living at Taunton National Park (Scientific) (Taunton). The aim of this study was to determine if traps and poison baits could be used to control feral cats without impacting non-target species at Taunton. The techniques trialled included poison fresh meat baits and several types of traps presented in different ways and with various lures. Thirty-one percent of fresh meat baits was taken during bait uptake trials; corvids removed 40\% of these and dogs removed 16\%. Cats were not detected, on camera traps, taking a bait. The elevated soft-jaw traps (81 trap nights/cat) and single-entry cage traps (98 trap nights/cat) were found to be the most successful of all the trap types trialled and had low amounts of by-catch. Other trap types trialled took more than 166 trap nights to catch a cat. The elevated soft-jaw trap configurations had the lowest amount of by-catch (avg. 0.33\%), and the log trap had the highest amount of by-catch (1\%). Ground-set traps successfully trapped cats (305 trap nights/cat) but caught more by-catch (0.9\%) compared to the elevated soft-jaw trap types and most wallabies caught in these traps had to be euthanised.",Bridled Nail-tailed Wallaby; feral Cat; pest management; threatened species,2022,23,1,10.1111/emr.12536,1442-7001,15,116,203,1262,4,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION,Evaluating predictors of Ptunarra Brown Butterfly Oreixenica ptunarra abundance on a conservation reserve to refine future monitoring,"Grasslands are globally threatened ecosystems and provide habitat for multiple threatened species. For this reason, grassland management must employ strategies which can protect multiple species of conservation significance. We reviewed surveillance monitoring data collected on a private conservation reserve in Tasmania between 2014 and 2021 for the endangered Ptunarra Brown Butterfly (Oreixenica ptunarra) to identify the landscape scale predictors of abundance. The data suggested that elevation (lower), time since fire (longer) and highland grassy sedgeland and subalpine Diplarrena latifolia rushland habitats were preferred. These data provide information on how to target future monitoring of this species more effectively.

ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION,Getting our Act together to improve Indigenous leadership and recognition in biodiversity management,"Increasingly scientists and policy makers are acknowledging the importance of Indigenous participation in effective biodiversity conservation. In Australia, the recognised Indigenous estate is vast, accounting for up to 57\% of the continent and comprising some of the highest priority conservation lands, including 46\% of the formal National Reserve System. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the Act) is Commonwealth legislation designed to protect and manage nationally and internationally important species and ecological communities, which entails specific objectives to recognise Indigenous people. However, to date the involvement of Indigenous people in implementation of the Act has been inconsistent and inadequate, particularly in the protection of the Indigenous estate, understanding and supporting Indigenous people's aspirations for Country and culturally significant species, and respecting the traditional management of species and landscapes. In this article, we will explore the key barriers and opportunities for improving Indigenous participation in biodiversity conservation under the Act. We structure our exploration using the three connected themes: (1) meaningful Indigenous engagement and participation, (2) recognition of the Indigenous Estate and (3) strengthening Indigenous-led governance. We find that there is a pressing need and an immediate opportunity to reform and strengthen the Act to protect Indigenous Knowledge, to recognise and report on the role of Indigenous Estate, and to realise the aspirations of Indigenous peoples for improved land and sea management that strengthens people, culture and Country.",Australia; environmental; Indigenous; legislation; reform; traditional ecological knowledge,2022,23,1,10.1111/emr.12523,1442-7001,13,100,229,1680,6,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Here, we share stories from one of the longest running Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs), Walalkara IPA, by Langaliki Robin, daughter of the founders of the IPA, who reflected on her parents' lessons about how Tjukurpa (Dreaming Law) is essential for conservation. Grounded theory analysis of her interview identified the importance of Tjukurpa and the role of Langaliki's parents, particularly her father Tjilpi Robin Kankapankatja in the establishment of the IPA. Tjukurpa was asserted as a core cultural knowledge system that provides Indigenous people with motivation, strength and well-being, allowing them to maintain access to Country and work cross-culturally. Tjukurpa influenced the initial declaration, roads and physical layout of the protected area and continues to guide the daily work activities of IPA rangers. According to Langaliki, the key to maintaining strong people and Country is to pass on cultural knowledge and Tjukurpa from generation to generation, especially to younger people. This research suggested that by knowing who the key knowledge holders are, respecting that Tjukurpa exists without being privy to the details, and continuing multi-generational access to Country, conservation programmes that embrace Indigenous ways of knowing and doing can achieve successful outcomes for nature conservation and Indigenous well-being.",conservation planning; desert; dreamtime; Indigenous ecological knowledge; land management; songlines; South Australia; water sources,2022,23,1,10.1111/emr.12528,1442-7001,18,146,222,1571,8,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Here, we outline the process developed to identify and assess candidate sites for assisted colonisation of the critically endangered Northern Corroboree Frog (Pseudophryne pengilleyi), a range-restricted species highly threatened by chytrid fungus. We first investigated the mechanisms associated with the persistence of Northern Corroboree Frog populations with chytrid fungus and then used a combination of desktop and field surveys to identify and assess sites based on habitat suitability, capacity to allow coexistence with chytrid fungus and hydrological properties. Candidate sites were further assessed by comparing environmental and climatic conditions to historical and persisting sites.

One of these principles involves an embodied process that allows us as Indigenous people to connect, analyse, predict and measure changes in Country.

ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION,"Learning together: developing collaborative monitoring of intertidal invertebrates in the Karajarri IPA, north-western Australia","The Karajarri Indigenous Protected Area, in the south-west Kimberley, is home to vast intertidal rock platforms that form a culturally and ecologically important environment for Karajarri Traditional Owners and wider Bidyadanga community. Karajarri Rangers initiated a collaborative partnership with researchers to devise an intertidal invertebrate monitoring protocol to meet the requirements of their Healthy Country Plan and sustainably manage their cultural harvesting. The project aimed to design and trial a monitoring protocol that blended Indigenous ecological knowledge and values with western scientific rigour. To investigate and document the community's ecological knowledge of marine resources, a series of Ranger interviews, focus groups and collaborative fieldwork was conducted. Data collected from these qualitative methods provided valuable insights into knowledge of the intertidal environment and fauna and the community's management aspirations and priorities. Informed by these data, a monitoring protocol was cross-culturally designed to combine Indigenous knowledge and values within a western scientific framework. Two methodologies were piloted, focusing on a small subset of culturally significant target species. Although both were successful, the trial indicated that Rangers preferred abundance-focused methods for ecological monitoring. Further refinement of the monitoring protocol is required to build western science knowledge of the ecosystem and meet Ranger management goals.

ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION,Lessons learned from small-scale coral outplanting intervention at a restoration site on the Great Barrier Reef,"Scientific, tourism and non-government organisations collaborated to design and undertake a small-scale coral outplanting intervention at Fitzroy Island, the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Cairns, Australia. Activities were implemented to assist recovery of a reef showing signs of reduced coral cover after recent coral bleaching and to trial potential for implementation of work of this kind by community members. In December 2017, 240 coral fragments were collected and deployed on mid-water coral nursery infrastructure. Ten months later, 96 corals (similar to 15 cm) were outplanted onto bare sections of the surrounding reef rock at depths of 2-8 m. Monitoring was undertaken to measure changes in coral cover at treatment and control locations to determine the potential of using coral outplanting intervention to assist the recovery of degraded reefs. We found no significant difference in live coral cover between controls and treatment over a 12-month period. Although statistically insignificant, we observed an increase in live coral cover in treatment plots (9.8\%) and control plots (2.2\%), indicating natural recovery processes occurring across the reef. Total number of fish species and abundance increased significantly over time.

Rotenone, applied at the approved rate (i.e. 0.25 ppm), failed to eradicate all Eastern Gambusia, and possibly all of the Pearl Cichlids in the first attempt, but at a higher dose rate (i.e. 1 ppm) it eradicated both species on the second attempt. We attributed the initial failure partially to the low dose rate of rotenone approved by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).

ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION,Monitoring populations and threats to range-restricted freshwater fishes: A case study of the Stocky Galaxias (Galaxias tantangara),"Monitoring is critical for conservation, to track the status of threatened species, assess the relative impacts of threats, inform management responses and prioritise them according to their efficacy. Globally, freshwater fish are impacted by a range of threats including deterioration in water quality, climate change, habitat loss and degradation, introduced predators and herbivores, and wildfire. Monitoring of freshwater fish can be challenging because aquatic conditions can make detecting and identifying population trends difficult for many species. Galaxiidae is the most speciose family of Gondwanan-distributed freshwater fishes, and over 75\% of species assessed by the IUCN Red List have been classified as threatened. Many Australian galaxiids are highly imperilled and monitoring effort and adequacy is low. We prepared a detailed monitoring plan for the Stocky Galaxias (Galaxias tantangara) that is representative of the conservation status and level of threat facing many congeneric and other similar species. Our protocol provides details of species biology, pertinent threats, and management options with sampling methods to gather these data, and options to link with management actions for maximum benefit. Improved monitoring linked with threat management should improve the conservation status of Stocky Galaxias.

ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT AND RESTORATION,"Recruitment and demographic structure of floodplain tree species in the Queensland Murray-Darling basin, Australia","Globally, floodplain and riparian forests are rapidly declining ecosystems due to anthropogenic influences coupled with a changing climate. In the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, little is known about the demographic structural status and recruitment of floodplain and riparian tree species. The aim of this study is to provide a baseline assessment of the current demographic structure of the ecosystem-defining tree species: River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), Coolibah (Eucalyptus coolabah), Black Box (Eucalyptus largiflorens) and River Cooba (Acacia stenophylla) within the basin in Queensland. Tree size data were collected from 131 plots of 0.25 ha located along major waterways and the abundance of individuals at the seedling, young tree, mature and senescent life cycle stages was determined. The diameter size distribution for the four species approximated a negative exponential distribution (reverse J-curve). Low tree abundance in the < 10-cm diameter class in all the species relative to the reverse J-curve suggested low recruitment and possible early evidence of a decline in the sustainability of the populations according to the Law of de Liocourt. This low abundance of young trees was more pronounced in Black Box and extended to the < 20-cm diameter class, but this species was not well replicated, and more data are required. In addition, the low abundance of recruitment trees occurred concurrently with the observed below average rainfall and erratic rainfall distribution in the last two decades relative to long-term totals. These results suggest a need for management interventions to foster seedling recruitment such as grazing management and tree planting programmes to ensure species establishment and survival along basin waterways.",climate change; demographic trend; forest health; regeneration; reverse J-curve; River Red Gum,2022,23,1,10.1111/emr.12525,1442-7001,14,114,261,1771,6,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,Climate change expected to improve digestive rate and trigger range expansion in outbreaking locusts,"Global climate change will probably exacerbate crop losses from insect pests, reducing agricultural production, and threatening food security. To predict where crop losses will occur, scientists have mainly used correlative models of species' distributions, but such models are unreliable when extrapolated to future environments. To minimize extrapolation, we developed mechanistic and hybrid models that explicitly capture range-limiting processes, and we explored how incorporating mechanisms altered the projected impacts of climate change for an agricultural pest, the South American locust (Schistocerca cancellata). Because locusts are generalist herbivores surrounded by food, their population growth may be limited by thermal effects on digestion more than food availability. To incorporate this mechanism into a distribution model, we measured the thermal effects on the consumption and defecation of field-captured locusts and used these data to model energy gain in current and future climates. We then created hybrid models by using outputs of the mechanistic model as predictor variables in correlative models, estimating the potential distribution of gregarious outbreaking locusts based on multiple predictor sets, modeling algorithms, and climate scenarios. Based on the mechanistic model, locusts can assimilate relatively high amounts of energy throughout temperate and tropical South America; however, correlative and hybrid modeling revealed that most tropical areas are unsuitable for locusts. When estimating current distributions, the top-ranked model was always the one fit with mechanistic predictors (i.e., the hybrid model). When projected to future climates, top-ranked hybrid models projected range expansions that were 23\%-30\% points smaller than those projected by correlative models. Therefore, a combination of the correlative and mechanistic approaches bracketed the potential outcomes of climate change and enhanced confidence where model projections agreed. Because all models projected a poleward range expansion under climate change, agriculturists should consider enhanced monitoring and the management of locusts near the southern margin of the range.",correlative; hybrid; insect pest; mechanistic; outbreak; Schistocerca; species distribution model; thermal physiology,2023,93,1,10.1002/ecm.1550,0012-9615,14,100,299,2194,8,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,Stable pollination service in a generalist high Arctic community despite the warming climate,"Insects provide key pollination services in most terrestrial biomes, but this service depends on a multistep interaction between insect and plant. An insect needs to visit a flower, receive pollen from the anthers, move to another conspecific flower, and finally deposit the pollen on a receptive stigma. Each of these steps may be affected by climate change, and focusing on only one of them (e.g., flower visitation) may miss important signals of change in service provision. In this study, we combine data on visitation, pollen transport, and single-visit pollen deposition to estimate functional outcomes in the high Arctic plant-pollinator network of Zackenberg, Northeast Greenland, a model system for global warming-associated impacts in pollination services. Over two decades of rapid climate warming, we sampled the network repeatedly: in 1996, 1997, 2010, 2011, and 2016. Although the flowering plant and insect communities and their interactions varied substantially between years, as expected based on highly variable Arctic weather, there was no detectable directional change in either the structure of flower-visitor networks or estimated pollen deposition. For flower-visitor networks compiled over a single week, species phenologies caused major within-year variation in network structure despite consistency across years. Weekly networks for the middle of the flowering season emerged as especially important because most pollination service can be expected to be provided by these large, highly nested networks. Our findings suggest that pollination ecosystem service in the high Arctic is remarkably resilient. This resilience may reflect the plasticity of Arctic biota as an adaptation to extreme and unpredictable weather. However, most pollination service was contributed by relatively few fly taxa (Diptera: Spilogona sanctipauli and Drymeia segnis {[}Muscidae] and species of Rhamphomyia {[}Empididae]). If these key pollinators are negatively affected by climate change, network structure and the pollination service that depends on it would be seriously compromised.",diptera; Dryas; flower visitor; phenology; pollen deposition; pollen transport,2023,93,1,10.1002/ecm.1551,0012-9615,13,92,300,2092,6,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,Character displacement when natural selection pushes in only one direction,"The usual conception of character displacement is of resource competitors differentiating to specialize on different prey in order to reduce competition. However, traits that underlie many predator-prey interactions, such as chase-evade speeds, gape limitation, and toxin concentrations, do not permit such specialization, but instead result in unidirectional evolutionary arms races. Here, we develop and analyze an evolutionary model of predator-prey interactions to explore whether character displacement will still occur when such unidirectional traits define the species interactions, and if so, what environmental conditions foster or retard differentiation. Character displacement in predators and prey does occur, and this differentiation is driven by fitness component trade-offs. Instead of specialization or compartmentalization in which different sets of species have strong interactions, differentiation in this model causes a nested community structure in which species of predators and prey have the same rank interaction strengths with species at the other trophic level. Also, analyses of the model predict that character displacement is fostered in environments with higher productivity, weaker stressors, and lower structural complexity. Model comparisons suggest that character displacement should occur over a broader set of environmental conditions when traits permit prey specialization than when traits foster arms races. These results highlight how different types of phenotypic traits that underlie species interactions shape the species diversification and the structure of the resulting community.",adaptive evolution; character displacement; character evolution; community structure; predator-prey interactions; unidirectional dependent traits,2022,92,4,10.1002/ecm.1547,0012-9615,10,74,219,1625,6,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,Do Nearctic hover flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) engage in long-distance migration? An assessment of evidence and mechanisms,"Long-distance insect migration is poorly understood despite its tremendous ecological and economic importance. As a group, Nearctic hover flies (Diptera: Syrphidae: Syrphinae), which are crucial pollinators as adults and biological control agents as larvae, are almost entirely unrecognized as migratory despite examples of highly migratory behavior among several Palearctic species. Here, we examined evidence and mechanisms of migration for four hover fly species (Allograpta obliqua, Eupeodes americanus, Syrphus rectus, and Syrphus ribesii) common throughout eastern North America using stable hydrogen isotope (delta H-2) measurements of chitinous tissue, morphological assessments, abundance estimations, and cold-tolerance assays. Although further studies are needed, nonlocal isotopic values obtained from hover fly specimens collected in central Illinois support the existence of long-distance fall migratory behavior in Eu. americanus, and to a lesser extent S. ribesii and S. rectus. Elevated abundance of Eu. americanus during the expected autumn migratory period further supports the existence of such behavior. Moreover, high phenotypic plasticity of morphology associated with dispersal coupled with significant differences between local and nonlocal specimens suggest that Eu. americanus exhibits a unique suite of morphological traits that decrease costs associated with long-distance flight. Finally, compared with the ostensibly nonmigratory A. obliqua, Eu. americanus was less cold tolerant, a factor that may be associated with migratory behavior. Collectively, our findings imply that fall migration occurs in Nearctic hover flies, but we consider the methodological limitations of our study in addition to potential ecological and economic consequences of these novel findings.",cold tolerance; deuterium; hover fly; insect migration; morphometrics; stable isotopes; Syrphidae,2022,92,4,10.1002/ecm.1542,0012-9615,16,120,242,1800,7,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,"Evaluating thermal performance of closely related taxa: Support for hotter is not better, but for unexpected reasons","Temperature drives performance and therefore adaptation; to interpret and understand these, thermal performance curves (TPC) are used, often through meta-analyses, revealing trends across divergent taxa. Four discrete hypotheses-thermodynamic-constraint; biochemical-adaptation (hotter is not better); specialist-generalist; thermal-trade-off-have arisen to explain cross-phyletic trends. In contrast, detailed comparisons of closely related taxa are rare, yet trends arising from these should reveal mechanisms of adaptation, as taxa diverge. Here, we combine experimental work with TPC theory to assess if the current hypotheses apply equally to closely related taxa. We established TPC for six species (and two strains of one species) of the animal model Tetrahymena (Ciliophora)-characterized by SSU rDNA/COX1 sequences-by examining specific growth rate (r), size (V), production (P = rV), and metabolic rate (rV(-0.25)) across 15-20 temperatures. Using parameters derived from the mechanistic ``Sharpe and DeMichele{''} function, we established a framework to test which hypothesis best represented the data. We conclude that superficially the ``hotter is not better{'' hypothesis is best but argue that the mechanistic theory underlying it cannot apply at the genus level: trends are likely to arise from little rather than substantial adaptation. Our further analysis suggests: (1) upward shift in the maximum-functioning temperature (T-max) is more constrained than the optimal temperature (T-opt), leading to a decreased safety margin (T-opt-T-max) and suggesting that species initially succeed in warmer environments through an increase in T-opt, followed by increasing T-max; and (2) thermal performance traits are correlated with phylogeny for closely related species, suggesting that species gradually adapt to new thermal environments.",adaptation; hotter is better; model organism; phylogeny; temperature; Tetrahymena; thermal response curve,2022,92,3,10.1002/ecm.1517,0012-9615,17,116,249,1849,7,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,Partitioning the effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functions at different trophic levels,"Biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning can be partitioned into complementarity effects, driven by many species, and selection effects, driven by few. Selection effects occur through interspecific abundance shifts (dominance) and intraspecific shifts in functioning. Complementarity and selection effects are often calculated for biomass, but very rarely for secondary productivity, that is, energy transfer to higher trophic levels. We calculated diversity effects for three functions: aboveground biomass, insect herbivory and pathogen infection, the latter two as proxies for energy transfer to higher trophic levels, in a grassland experiment (PaNDiv) manipulating species richness, functional composition, nitrogen enrichment, and fungicide treatment. Complementarity effects were, on average, positive and selection effects negative for biomass production and pathogen infection and multiple species contributed to diversity effects in mixtures. Diversity effects were, on average, less pronounced for herbivory. Diversity effects for the three functions were not correlated, because different species drove the different effects. Benefits (and costs) from growing in diverse communities, be it reduced herbivore or pathogen damage or increased productivity either due to abundance increases or increased productivity per area were distributed across different plant species, leading to highly variable contributions of single species to effects of diversity on different functions. These results show that different underlying ecological mechanisms can result in similar overall diversity effects across functions.",additive partitioning; biodiversity experiment; complementarity effect; ecosystem functioning; grassland; insect herbivory; pathogen infection; selection effect; tripartite partitioning,2022,92,3,10.1002/ecm.1521,0012-9615,13,94,214,1627,9,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,Quantifying eco-evolutionary contributions to trait divergence in spatially structured systems,"Ecological and evolutionary processes can occur at similar time scales and, hence, influence one another. There has been much progress in developing metrics that quantify contributions of ecological and evolutionary components to trait change over time. However, many empirical evolutionary ecology studies document trait differentiation among populations structured in space. In both time and space, the observed differentiation in trait values among populations and communities can be the result of interactions between nonevolutionary (phenotypic plasticity, changes in the relative abundance of species) and evolutionary (genetic differentiation among populations) processes. However, the tools developed so far to quantify ecological and evolutionary contributions to trait changes are implicitly addressing temporal dynamics because they require directionality of change from an ancestral to a derived state. Identifying directionality from one site to another in spatial studies of eco-evolutionary dynamics is not always possible and often not meaningful. We suggest three modifications to existing partitioning metrics so they allow quantifying ecological and evolutionary contributions to changes in population and community trait values across spatial locations in landscapes. Applying these spatially modified metrics to published empirical examples shows how these metrics can be used to generate new empirical insights and to facilitate future comparative analyses.

ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,High adaptability of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica to drought-induced soil nutrient deficiency,"Background Drought can exert a profound influence on soil nutrient availability, and understanding whether and how tree species adapt to this change is a critical priority for predicting the consequence of climate change on forest structure and function. The objective of this study was to examine the adaptability of Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) to drought-induced changes in soil nutrient availability from the perspective of root functions. Methods We conducted a 7-year precipitation manipulation experiment with three levels of throughfall reduction (0\%, 30\%, and 50\%) to simulate different drought intensities. We measured soil physicochemical properties and fine-root nutrient concentrations and biomass, and calculated the stoichiometric homeostatic regulation coefficient (1/H) of fine roots. Results Drought reduced soil organic carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and inorganic N concentrations, as well as ratios of total N to total P, and available N to available P in the 0-20 cm soil layer. In contrast, drought had no significant effect on fine-root N and P concentrations, and fine-root biomass in the 0-40 cm soil layer. Fine roots displayed high homeostatic regulation coefficients of N (with 1/H values of 0.19 and 0) and P (with 1/H values of 0.33 and 0) concentrations in 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil layers, respectively. Conclusions Our results indicate that drought leads to soil nutrient deficiency and the decoupling between N and P cycling, and provide evidence that Mongolian pine has high adaptability to drought-induced decrease in soil nutrient availability by maintaining great fine-root biomass to ensure sufficient nutrient uptake.",C; N; P stoichiometry; Fine-root biomass; Stoichiometric homeostasis; Throughfall reduction,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00381-1,NA,12,96,251,1689,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Quantifying relations between altered hydrology and fish community responses for streams in Minnesota,"Background Altered hydrology is a stressor on aquatic life, but quantitative relations between specific aspects of streamflow alteration and biological responses have not been developed on a statewide scale in Minnesota. Best subsets regression analysis was used to develop linear regression models that quantify relations among five categories of hydrologic metrics (i.e., duration, frequency, magnitude, rate-of-change, and timing) computed from streamgage records and six categories of biological metrics (i.e., composition, habitat, life history, reproductive, tolerance, trophic) computed from fish-community samples, as well as fish-based indices of biotic integrity (FIBI) scores and FIBI scores normalized to an impairment threshold of the corresponding stream class (FIBI\_BCG4). Relations between hydrology and fish community responses were examined using three hydrologic datasets that represented periods of record, long-term changes, and short-term changes to flow regimes in streams of Minnesota. Results Regression models demonstrated significant relations between hydrologic explanatory metrics and fish-based biological response metrics, and the five regression models with the strongest linear relations explained over 70\% of the variability in the biological metric using three hydrologic metrics as explanatory variables. Tolerance-based biological metrics demonstrated the strongest linear relations to hydrologic metrics. The most commonly used hydrologic metrics were related to bankfull flows and aspects of flow variability. Conclusions Final regression models represent paired streamgage records and biological samples throughout the State of Minnesota and encompass differences in stream orders, hydrologic landscape units, and watershed sizes. Presented methods can support evaluations of stream fish communities and facilitate targeted efforts to improve the health of fish communities. Methods also can be applied to locations outside of Minnesota with continuous streamgage data and fish-community samples.",EflowStats; Best subset regression; Altered hydrology; Fish community; Indices of biotic integrity; Ecological flows,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00383-z,NA,13,101,268,2038,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Camera traps reveal the natural corridors used by mammalian species in eastern Mexico,"Background Habitat loss and fragmentation in the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO) ecological corridor have negative impacts on the movement and distribution of mammalian species that are of great ecological and evolutionary importance. Part of the SMO ecological corridor that is located in the state of Hidalgo is less studied despite being a potential dispersal route for mammals. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the presence and activity of terrestrial mammals in the riparian and non-riparian zones of SMO. Results Camera traps detected 15 mammalian species (i.e., 14 native and 1 domestic) in the non-riparian zone, and 12 mammalian species in the riparian zone (i.e., 10 wild and 2 domestic). The riparian corridor was mainly used by opportunistic medium-sized carnivores, while large carnivores and their potential prey were more frequent in the non-riparian zone. Conclusions Our findings suggest terrestrial mammals avoid the use of natural corridors due to the presence of domestic dogs, cattle and humans and look for new dispersal routes to move through their habitat and find the resources they need to survive. Even though some species can use disturbed corridors to move and find resources, they will change their activity patterns to avoid contact with humans and potential threats like dogs. It is, therefore, crucial to identify not one, but several corridors that must be preserved to improve the connectivity of terrestrial mammals in disturbed landscapes.",Activity; Jaguar; Cattle; Detectability; Dog; Herbivore; Disturbance; Prey; Relative abundance,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00394-w,NA,13,85,230,1485,9,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Floristic composition, growth temperament and conservation status of woody plant species in the Cameroonian tropical rainforests","Introduction Cameroon's tropical rainforests are nowadays strewn with rural forests maintained by local populations; however, these forests are not officially recognized in the non-permanent forest domain. Rural forests are non-delimited riparian areas within the dense moist forest, reserved for rural housing, agricultural activities and agroforestry practices, freely exploited by the local communities for their livelihood without them having any rights to artisanal and commercial logging. This study aimed at contributing to the flora knowledge and the conservation state of woody plant species in rainforests. The study was carried out in two rural forests located in the Eastern and Southern agroforestry zones of Cameroon. Methods The method adopted for floristic inventories combined a fixed area sampling unit and a variable area sampling unit. Woody individuals with diameter at breast height (dbh) < 3.2 cm were counted and shrubs of 3.2 <= dbh < 10 cm were measured to analyse the understorey, while trees with dbh >= 10 cm were measured and identified to characterize the canopy. Results In the Essiengbot-Mbankoho rural forest in Eastern Cameroon, 468 species belonging to 61 families were recorded in the understory while 227 species belonging to 53 families were identified at the canopy level. A total of 40 (7.68\%) threatened species, 18 (3.45\%) Near Threatened species and 408 (78.31\%) Least Concern species were recorded. In the Nbgwassa-Opkweng rural forest in Southern Cameroon, 534 species belonging to 64 families were identified in the understory while 225 species belonging to 43 families were recorded in the canopy. A total of 54 (9.69\%) threatened species, 25 (4.49\%) Near Threatened species and 421 (75.58\%) Least Concern species were identified in this forest. Shannon's diversity indices were above five in the understories and canopies of both forests. Shade-bearer species were the most represented in the understories while the non-pioneer light-demanding and shade-bearer species were the most abundant in the canopies. Conclusions Despite the influence of slash-and-burn agriculture and subsistence farming practices, rural forests managed by local populations provide opportunities for preserving plant biodiversity. However, the presence of threatened species, pioneer species and non-pioneer light-demanding species in these forests is an indicator of moderate and man-induced disturbances that, in the absence of a forest management plan or sustainable management, may threaten this biodiversity. Legal management of rural forests could help in limiting the anthropogenic activities and pressures on community forests.",Floristic composition; Rural forest; Growth temperament; Understory; Canopy; Conservation status,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00387-9,NA,16,128,388,2667,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,yes,no,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Application of machine learning techniques to simulate the evaporative fraction and its relationship with environmental variables in corn crops,"Background The evaporative fraction (EF) represents an important biophysical parameter reflecting the distribution of surface available energy. In this study, we investigated the daily and seasonal patterns of EF in a multi-year corn cultivation located in southern Italy and evaluated the performance of five machine learning (ML) classes of algorithms: the linear regression (LR), regression tree (RT), support vector machine (SVM), ensembles of tree (ETs) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict the EF at daily time step. The adopted methodology consisted of three main steps that include: (i) selection of the EF predictors; (ii) comparison of the different classes of ML; (iii) application, cross-validation of the selected ML algorithms and comparison with the observed data. Results Our results indicate that SVM and GPR were the best classes of ML at predicting the EF, with a total of four different algorithms: cubic SVM, medium Gaussian SVM, the Matern 5/2 GPR, and the rational quadratic GPR. The comparison between observed and predicted EF in all four algorithms, during the training phase, were within the 95\% confidence interval: the R-2 value between observed and predicted EF was 0.76 (RMSE 0.05) for the medium Gaussian SVM, 0.99 (RMSE 0.01) for the rational quadratic GPR, 0.94 (RMSE 0.02) for the Matern 5/2 GPR, and 0.83 (RMSE 0.05) for the cubic SVM algorithms. Similar results were obtained during the testing phase. The results of the cross-validation analysis indicate that the R-2 values obtained between all iterations for each of the four adopted ML algorithms were basically constant, confirming the ability of ML as a tool to predict EF. Conclusion ML algorithms represent a valid alternative able to predict the EF especially when remote sensing data are not available, or the sky conditions are not suitable. The application to different geographical areas, or crops, requires further development of the model based on different data sources of soils, climate, and cropping systems.",Energy flux; Evapotranspiration; Eddy covariance; Artificial intelligence,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00400-1,NA,19,143,315,2026,4,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Exploring patterns and consequences of land consumption in a coastal city-region,"Background The rapid expansion of built-up areas and land consumption with unsustainable spatial patterns in coastal urban areas has become a global major concern due to its far-reaching consequences for human daily life, environmental sustainability, and living organisms. However, the research on this phenomenon in these areas has received less attention. To fill this gap, we conducted a study to explore the spatial patterns of land consumption at both micro- and macro-levels and to evaluate its consequences in terms of sustainable development in a coastal city-region of Mazandaran Province in northern Iran. To achieve these two goals, we combined two methods of urban land density function and landscape expansion index (LEI) to explore spatial patterns of land consumption and also evaluated the sustainability of the region with two methods of the hierarchical analytical process (AHP) and urban sustainability index (USI). Results The spatial patterns of land consumption in the city-region of Mazandaran from 1996 to 2016 at the macro-level changed from a decentralized-sprawl to a centralized-sprawl pattern. At the micro-level, the dominant spatial pattern of land consumption in the city-region changed gradually from the outlying pattern towards the edge expansion and infilling patterns. Also, the spatial pattern of the built-up patches in the majority of the urban areas had conformity with the dominant pattern of the region. Besides, the spatial patterns of land consumption in the region were in an unsustainable state and were changing towards more unsustainability. The absence of urban containment policies and plans could lead to further destruction of the natural environment and increase its unsustainability. Conclusions Our results indicate that the urban areas of the coastal Mazandaran have the same behavior in the spatial pattern of land consumption at the macro- and micro-levels and all are in the same direction and follow the dominant pattern of the region.",Land consumption; Land use change; Spatial pattern; Urban growth; Sprawl; Sustainability; Consequence; Urban area,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00391-z,NA,11,80,302,1997,8,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Nature-based recreation for the elderly in urban areas: assessing opportunities and demand as planning support,"Background With elderly people comprising a growing share of the population, landscape planners need to consider their specific requirements to enhance the opportunities for them to engage in nature-based recreation (NBR). However, few studies have spatially assessed the recreation potential, demand, and opportunities for elderly people in cities. Thus, this paper aimed to spatially model and investigate the NBR opportunities for and demand of elderly people in urban areas. A spatial framework based on the ESTIMAP recreation model was developed, considering special factors to better reflect elderly people's preferences regarding NBR at the city scale. In particular, NBR opportunities were assessed considering landscape aesthetics, various types of facilities, and proximity. The street network was used to understand elderly people's walking behaviours regarding green spaces and related facilities. Results A case study in Hannover, Germany, demonstrated the applicability of the proposed method. The results illustrate the spatial heterogeneity of recreation options for the elderly. Only parts of Hannover's green spaces offer high recreation opportunities for elderly people. Many of the existing green spaces lack diverse landscape components and sufficient supply of facilities, resulting in a compromise to aesthetics and recreational opportunities. Conclusions The proposed method contributes to research on spatial planning and environmental justice by incorporating vulnerable groups' preferences and needs in spatially assessing NBR. The planning implications highlight pocket gardens and greenways connecting communities and parks as development opportunities in the city.",Sustainability; Nature-based recreation; Population aging; Landscape architecture; GIS mapping; Urban design,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00390-0,NA,15,110,232,1694,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Root-order-associated variations in fine-root decomposition and their effects on soil in a subtropical evergreen forest,"Background Despite the importance of root decomposition in predicting ecosystem responses to future climate change, the effects of branch order on root decomposition and the feedback to soil still remains poorly understood. Here we separated root samples taken from two tree species (Castanopsis fargesii and Schima superba in subtropical forests along the coastal area in eastern China) into four-order classes (1st-2nd order, 3rd order, 4th order, and 5th order) and conducted a 540-day litterbag incubation experiment in laboratory to examine root mass loss, nutrient release, and the influence on soil during decomposition. Results C. fargesii roots of 1st-2nd and 3rd order decayed more slowly than those of 4th and 5th order, but this pattern was not significant for S. superba. Of all the measured root traits, the decomposition rates correlated best with root C/N ratio, diameter and specific root length (SRL) based on the structural equation modeling. Both tree species and root order exhibited significantly effects on root initial traits. Overall, C. fargesii roots decay faster than S. superba, and this appears to be associated with root initial C quality and N concentration. In addition, root order positively affected root decomposition rates mainly through root diameter and SRL. However, no significant difference was found in C and N content between soils below the litterbag with different-order roots. Conclusions Our findings suggest the effects of branch order on root decomposition are dependent on tree species. Moreover, root morphological properties might also be the controlling factor in root decay besides root chemistry fractions. Overall, the integrative effects should be considered to improve our understanding of the fate of fine-root litter and their contribution to soil C and N pool.",Root branch; Mass loss; Initial quality; Subtropical evergreen tree; Soil carbon,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00393-x,NA,15,119,277,1822,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Climate change-driven shifts in plant-soil feedbacks: a meta-analysis,"Background Climate change is expected to affect plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs, i.e., the effects of a plant on the growth of another plant or community grown in the same soil via changes in soil abiotic and biotic properties), influencing plant community dynamics and, through this, ecosystem functioning. However, our knowledge of the effects of climate changes on the magnitude and direction of PSFs remains limited, with considerable variability between studies. We quantified PSFs associated with common climate change factors, specifically drought and warming, and their corresponding ambient (control) conditions using a meta-analytical approach. We investigated whether drought and warming effects on PSFs were consistent across functional groups, life histories (annual versus perennial) and species origin (native versus non-native), planting (monoculture, mixed culture) and experimental (field, greenhouse/laboratory) conditions. Results PSFs were negative (a mechanism that encourage species co-existence) under drought and neutral under corresponding ambient conditions, whereas PSFs were negative under both ambient and elevated temperatures, with no apparent difference in effect size. The response to drought was largely driven by stronger negative PSFs in grasses, indicating that grasses are more likely to show stronger negative PSFs than other functional groups under drought. Moreover, non-native species showed negative drought-induced PSFs while native species showed neutral PSFs under drought. By contrast, we found the opposite in pattern in response to warming for native and non-native species. Perennial herbs displayed stronger drought-induced negative PSFs than annual herbs. Mixed species communities displayed more negative PSFs than monocultures, independent of climate treatment. Finally, warming and drought treatment PSF effect sizes were more negative in experiments performed in the field than under controlled conditions. Conclusions We provide evidence that drought and warming can induce context-specific shifts in PSFs, which are dependent on plant functional groups, life history traits and experimental conditions. These shifts would be expected to have implications for plant community dynamics under projected climate change scenarios.",Climate change; Drought; Warming; Plant functional group; Life cycle; Species origin,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00410-z,NA,8,69,311,2279,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Soil quality estimation using environmental covariates and predictive models: an example from tropical soils of Nigeria,"Background: Information addressing soil quality in developing countries often depends on results from small experimental plots, which are later extrapolated to vast areas of agricultural land. This approach often results in misinformation to end-users of land for sustainable soil nutrient management. The objective of this study was to estimate the spatial variability of soil quality index (SQI) at regional scale with predictive models using soil-environmental covariates. Methods: A total of 110 composite soil samples (0-30 cm depth) were collected by stratified random sampling schemes at 2-5 km intervals across the Cross River State, Nigeria, and selected soil physical and chemical properties were determined. We employed environmental covariates derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) and Sentinel-2 imageries for our modelling regime. We measured soil quality using two approaches {[}total data set (TDS) and minimum data set (MDS)]. Two scoring functions were also applied, linear (L) and non-linear (NL), yielding four indices (MDS\_L, MDS\_NL,TDS\_L, and TDS\_NL). Eleven soil quality indicators were used as TDS and were further screened for MDS using principal component analysis (PCA). Random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), regression kriging (RK), Cubist regression, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were applied to predict SQI in unsampled locations. Results: The computed SQI via MDS\_L was classified into five classes: <= 0.38, 0.38-0.48, 0.48-0.58, 0.58-0.68, and >= 0.68, representing very low (class V), low (class IV), moderate (class III), high (class II) and very high (class I) soil quality, respectively. GWR model was robust in predicting soil quality (R-2 =0.21, CCC= 0.39, RMSE =0.15), while RF was a model with inferior performance (R-2 =0.02, CCC= 0.32, RMSE = 0.15). Soil quality was high in the southern region and low in the northern region. High soil quality class (>49\%) and moderate soil quality class (>14\%) dominate the study area in all predicted models used. Conclusions: Structural stability index, sand content, soil oganic carbon content, and mean weight diameter of aggregates were the parameters used in establishing regional soil quality indices, while land surface water index, Sentinel-2 near-infrared band, plane curvature, and clay index were the most important variables affecting soil quality variability. The MDS\_L and GWR are effective and useful models to identify the key soil properties for assessing soil quality, which can provide guidance for site-specific management of soils developed on diverse parent materials.",Decision support system; Geospatial technology; Predictive model; Remote sensing; Soil quality,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00411-y,NA,16,119,384,2616,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,yes,no,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Amphibian richness along modified riparian areas of central Mexico: conservation priorities,"Background Land-use change frequently affects faunistic populations and communities. To achieve successful conservation strategies, we need suitable information about species distribution and the causes of extinction risk. Many amphibian species depend on riparian vegetation to complete their life cycles. About 41\% of amphibian species are globally threatened, and accurate estimations of population size, species richness and the identification of critical habitats are urgently needed worldwide. To evaluate the magnitude of changes in species richness and demography, estimations that include detection probability are necessary. In this study, we employed multi-species occupancy models to estimate detection probability and the effect of land cover type (i.e., cropland, artificial pasture, secondary and mature forest) in a 500-m radius on the occupancy probability and richness of diurnal amphibians in 60 riparian zones in the state of Michoacan in central Mexico. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential of the endemic salamander Ambystoma ordinarium as a flagship species for the conservation of other native amphibian species. Results We registered a total of 20 amphibian species in the diurnal assemblage, of which 10 species are considered at risk of extinction. We found that cropland was the most important land-use type for explaining amphibian distribution in riparian zones, with negative effects on most amphibian species. We found no differences in species richness between zones with and without A. ordinarium. In riparian zones occupied by A. ordinarium, however, we found a higher number of species at risk of extinction. Conclusions Our findings showed negative effects of croplands on the distribution of most amphibian species. The riparian zones are important for the maintenance of native diurnal amphibian communities and A. ordinarium can act as a flagship species for the conservation of threatened amphibian species.",Flagship species; Habitat quality; Occupancy models; Salamanders; Threatened species,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00408-7,NA,11,91,282,1952,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Effect of shifting cultivation and fallow on soil quality index in Mokokchung district, Nagaland, India","Background Shifting cultivation is a major agriculture practice in the Nagaland state of India. This study examines the effect of shifting cultivation and the length of the fallow period on soil quality index (SQI). Four sites were selected for the study, viz., a shifting cultivation site (SCS), a 3-year-old fallow land (FL-3), a 7-year-old fallow land (FL-7), and a 12-year-old fallow land (FL-12). Soil parameters were recorded seasonally and SQI was calculated from the minimum data set. Results With the increase in the fallow period, the values of conductivity, soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, moisture, clay, and cation exchange capacity of soil increased. Meanwhile, soil pH and bulk density decreased with fallow duration. The additive SQI(a) values were in the order SCS < FL-3 < FL-12 < FL-7; meanwhile, the weighted SQI(w) values were in the order SCS < FL-3 < FL-7 < FL-12. It is also observed that the SQI value decreases with the increase in soil depth under both the weighted and additive indexes. SCS with the lowest SQI value reflects the reduced soil organic carbon (SOC) and macronutrients. Increased SOC levels in site FL-12 (2.88-3.94\%) may be one reason for its higher SQI value. Conclusions Our study highlights that unsustainable practices of shifting cultivation and reduction in the fallow period negatively affect soil quality. Furthermore, the study also recommends the use of the weighted method of SQI as it agrees with the reports of land use causing alteration in the soil quality. Our findings may be utilized to quickly access and disseminate information to the stakeholders and aid in constructing local soil quality index maps of the region. There is an urgent need for a rapid, cost and resource-efficient soil quality assessment and SQI may be one tool that achieves this goal.",Shifting cultivation; Jhum; Soil quality index; Soil health; Seasonal variation; Nagaland; India,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00386-w,NA,15,103,299,1873,7,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Effects of altitude and slope on the climate-radial growth relationships of Larix olgensis A. Henry in the southern Lesser Khingan Mountains, Northeast China","Background The relationship between climate and radial growth of trees exhibits spatial variation due to environmental changes. Therefore, elucidation of how the growth-climate responses of trees vary in space is essential for understanding forest growth dynamics to facilitate scientific management with the ongoing global climate warming. To explore the altitudinal and slope variations of these interactions, tree-ring width chronologies of Larix olgensis A. Henry were analyzed in the southern Lesser Khingan Mountains, Northeast China. Results The radial growth of L. olgensis exhibited significant 5- to 10-year periodic changes at three altitudes and two slopes, and the frequency change occurred mainly during the early growth stage and after 2000. The radial growth of L. olgensis was significantly negatively correlated with September precipitation only at low altitudes, but also with the mean temperature in July-August and the mean maximum temperature in June-August at high altitudes. The radial growth of L. olgensis at low and middle altitudes as well as on the sunny slope led to a higher demand for moisture, while temperature was the key limiting factor at high altitudes and on the shady slope. Conclusions The climate-radial growth relationship of L. olgensis exhibits altitudinal and slope variability. This study quantitatively describes the spatially varying growth-climate responses of L. olgensis in the southern Lesser Khingan Mountains, which provides basic data for the management of L. olgensis forests and the prediction of future climate impacts on forest ecosystems.",Larix olgensis A; Henry; Altitudinal gradient; Slope variability; Lesser Khingan Mountains,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00388-8,NA,23,157,235,1599,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Patterns and drivers of tree carbon stocks in Kashmir Himalayan forests: implications for climate change mitigation,"Background Temperate forests are major carbon sinks because of their high storage potential and low decomposition processes. We quantified tree carbon (TC) storage from 143 plots distributed across three major forest types of Kashmir Himalaya, relative to differences in ecological factors. Combined regression and Random Forest (RF) analysis were used to examine the distribution of TC stock along ecological gradients and recognize the role of driving factors on TC stocks. Results Among the three forest types, sub-alpine (SA) forest was the primary TC sink, accounting for 228.73 t ha(-1) of carbon, followed by mixed conifer (MC; 181.29 t C ha(-1)) and blue pine (BP; 133.04 t C ha(-1)) forests. The distribution of TC stocks among the three forest types differed significantly (chi(2) = 18.87; P = 0.000). Relative carbon stock analysis demonstrated that Abies pindrow and Pinus wallichiana accounted 91\% of TC stocks across the landscape. Basal area, mean diameter at breast height (DBH), elevation, disturbance and precipitation had significant effects on TC stocks in bivariate regression models. The RF model explained 86\% of the variation; basal area interpreted 30.15\%, followed by mean DBH (17.96\%), disturbance complex (10.64\%), precipitation (8.00\%) and elevation (7.34\%). Conclusions Kashmir Himalayan forests are significant carbon sinks as they store a substantial quantum of carbon in trees. Forest carbon, an essential climatic indicator, is determined by a complex interaction of other ecological variables, particularly stand structural features. The study provides insights into the role of these natural forests in climate change mitigation and in REDD+/national commitments to offset the carbon.",Carbon stock; Climate change; Coniferous forest; Disturbance; Kashmir Himalaya; Stand structure,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00402-z,NA,16,115,254,1727,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Hunting of hunted: an ensemble modeling approach to evaluate suitable habitats for caracals in India,"Background: Large-scale hunting and various anthropogenic pressures in the recent past have pushed the Asiatic caracal (Caracal caracal schmitzi), an elusive medium-sized and locally threatened felid species towards local extinction in India. Though widely distributed historically, it has been sparsely reported from several regions of central and northern states in India till twentieth century. Later, the species distribution became confined only to the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, which have had reported sightings in the twenty-first century. In order to highlight the potentially suitable habitats for Asiatic caracals in India, we targeted forth-filtering of the spatial model ensemble by creating and utilizing the validated and spatially thinned species presence information (n =69) and related ecological variables (aridity, NDVI, precipitation seasonality, temperature seasonality, terrain ruggedness), filtered with anthropological variable (nightlight). Results: Out of eight spatial prediction models, the two most parsimonious models, Random Forest (AUC 0.91) and MaxEnt (AUC 0.89) were weighted and ensembled. The ensemble model indicated several clustered habitats, covering 1207.83 km(2) areas in Kachchh (Gujarat), Aravalli mountains (Rajasthan), Malwa plateau (Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh), and Bundelkhand region (Madhya Pradesh) as potentially suitable habitats for caracals. Output probabilities of pixels were further regressed with converted vegetation height data within selected highly potential habitats, i.e., Ranthambore Kuno Landscape (RKL) (suitability similar to 0.44 +/- 0.03(vegetation height){*}{*}, R-2 = 0.27). The regression model inferred a significant positive relation between vegetation height and habitat suitability, hence the lowest ordinal class out of three classes of converted vegetation height was masked out from the RKL, which yielded in an area of 567 km(2) as potentially highly suitable habitats for caracals, which can be further proposed as survey areas and conservation priority areas for caracals.

ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,"A global meta-analysis of woody plant responses to elevated CO2: implications on biomass, growth, leaf N content, photosynthesis and water relations","Background Atmospheric CO2 may double by the year 2100, thereby altering plant growth, photosynthesis, leaf nutrient contents and water relations. Specifically, atmospheric CO2 is currently 50\% higher than pre-industrial levels and is projected to rise as high as 936 mu mol mol(-1) under worst-case scenario in 2100. The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of elevated CO2 on woody plant growth, production, photosynthetic characteristics, leaf N and water relations. Methods A meta-analysis of 611 observations from 100 peer-reviewed articles published from 1985 to 2021 was conducted. We selected articles in which elevated CO2 and ambient CO2 range from 600-1000 and 300-400 mu mol mol(-1), respectively. Elevated CO2 was categorized into < 700, 700 and > 700 mu mol mol(-1) concentrations. Results Total biomass increased similarly across the three elevated CO2 concentrations, with leguminous trees (LTs) investing more biomass to shoot, whereas non-leguminous trees (NLTs) invested to root production. Leaf area index, shoot height, and light-saturated photosynthesis (A(max)) were unresponsive at < 700 mu mol mol(-1), but increased significantly at 700 and > 700 mu mol mol(-1). However, shoot biomass and A(max) acclimatized as the duration of woody plants exposure to elevated CO2 increased. Maximum rate of photosynthetic Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax) and apparent maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport (J(max)) were downregulated. Elevated CO2 reduced stomatal conductance (g(s)) by 32\% on average and increased water use efficiency by 34, 43 and 63\% for < 700, 700 and > 700 mu mol mol(-1), respectively. Leaf N content decreased two times more in NLTs than LTs growing at elevated CO2 than ambient CO2. Conclusions Our results suggest that woody plants will benefit from elevated CO2 through increased photosynthetic rate, productivity and improved water status, but the responses will vary by woody plant traits and length of exposure to elevated CO2.",Atmospheric CO2; Biomass production; Leaf nitrogen content; Meta-analysis; Photosynthetic rate; Stomatal conductance; Water use efficiency; Woody plants,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00397-7,NA,21,148,300,2001,8,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,Impaired cellulose decomposition in a headwater stream receiving subsurface agricultural drainage,"Background Agricultural development of former wetlands has resulted in many headwater streams being sourced by subsurface agricultural drainage systems. Subsurface drainage inputs can significantly influence stream environmental conditions, such as temperature, hydrology, and water chemistry, that drive ecological function. However, ecological assessments of subsurface drainage impacts are rare. We assessed the impact of an agricultural drainage system on cellulose decomposition and benthic respiration using a paired stream study in a headwater branch of Nissouri Creek, in Ontario, Canada. Adjacent first order segments sourced by a spring-fed marsh and a cropped field with subsurface drainage, as well as the adjoining trunk segment, were sampled over a year using the cotton strip assay to measure cellulose decomposition and benthic respiration. Results Assessments of cellulose decomposition revealed a one-third reduction in the drainage-sourced segment compared to marsh-sourced segment. Between segment differences in cellulose decomposition were associated with reduced summer temperatures in the drainage-sourced segment. Impacts of stream cooling from the drainage-sourced segment were transmitted downstream as cellulose decomposition was slower than expected throughout the drainage-sourced segment and for several hundred meters down the adjoining trunk segment. Benthic respiration only differed between the drainage- and marsh-sourced segments in spring, when stream temperatures were similar. Conclusions Our findings suggest there may be a widespread reduction in cellulose decomposition in streams across similar agricultural regions where subsurface drainage is prevalent. However, cooling of streams receiving significant amounts of water inputs from subsurface drainage systems may impart increased resiliency to future climate warming.",Stream; Agriculture; Cotton strip assay; Seasonality; Organic matter breakdown; Benthic respiration,2022,11,1,10.1186/s13717-022-00406-9,NA,11,97,246,1865,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,"Diel and seasonal changes in gut contents of omnivorous-carnivorous macroinvertebrates in the Yura River, Japan","Diel and seasonal changes in the gut contents of omnivorous-carnivorous macroinvertebrates were examined in a Japanese mountain stream based on direct observation of gut contents. Carnivorous-omnivorous (predator) macroinvertebrates were sampled at four time periods (02:00-03:00, 08:00-09:00, 14:00-15:00, and 20:00-21:00) on 3 days in each of March, June, September, and December. A total of 1391 individual macroinvertebrates belonging to 71 taxa were dissected: identifiable gut contents were observed in 928 individuals and prey identified to the family level were observed from the guts of 564 individuals. Using nonmetric multidimensional scaling, interspecific variation in foraging patterns was summarized into two axes that approximately correspond to body size and habitat preferences of prey taxa. Although seasonal patterns in the number of prey individuals in a gut varied among taxa, in March and December, several predators notably foraged on taxa such as Simuliidae, which inhabits stone surfaces in river sections with a rapid current. This pattern may be explained by season-specific prey availability and predation risks from vertebrates. Diel changing patterns in the number of prey individuals per gut varied among predator taxa, and most predators did not show obvious proportional changes in gut contents. These results indicate that subcompartments of interaction networks and numerous indirect effects via intraguild predation potentially exist within the ``guild `` of macroinvertebrates, which are often summarized as mesopredators of stream food webs.",aquatic insect; invertebrate community; ontogenetic niche shift; size-structured food web; stomach contents analysis,2023,38,2,10.1111/1440-1703.12372,0912-3814,15,111,224,1580,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Effect of local- and landscape-scale factors on the distribution of the spring-dependent species Geothelphusa dehaani and larval Anotogaster sieboldii,"Knowledge of the effects of local- and landscape-scale environmental factors is indispensable for the conservation of wetland biodiversity. We surveyed the distribution and abundance of two spring-dependent invertebrates, the Japanese freshwater crab Geothelphusa dehaani and larvae of dragonfly Anotogaster sieboldii, at 37 spring-fed wetlands in the Lake Inba watershed, Japan. The relationships among local factors (water temperature, channel-water velocity, substrate type, and abundance of the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii), a landscape-scale factor (the percentage of permeable surface in catchment; PPSC), and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of each species were analyzed using path analyses. PPSC indirectly affected the CPUE of both G. dehaani and A. sieboldii via different processes. For G. dehaani, PPSC affected the CPUE via a positive effect on channel-water velocity and substrate composition in the wetland. On the other hand, PPSC positively affected the CPUE of A. sieboldii by decreasing the summer water temperature. Red swamp crayfish had no significant direct effects on either species, although we found a significant negative effect of channel-water velocity on the distribution of red swamp crayfish. For conservation of these spring-dependent species, we suggest preserving the area of permeable surface in the watershed in order to maintain flow velocity and low water temperature in wetlands.",groundwater-dependent ecosystem; habitat; land use; cover change; spring seepage; Yatsu,2023,38,1,10.1111/1440-1703.12352,0912-3814,19,150,205,1427,6,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Resource allocation strategies in the reproductive organs of Fagaceae species,"Allocation strategies of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) are key to the reproductive processes of plants. Nutrient allocation to seeds depends on defensive traits of seeds and fruit because greater nutritional contents attract more seed predators. To compare resource allocation strategies for reproductive and defensive traits across species, we calculated the cost of resource investment in reproductive organs for nine species from four genera and defensive traits for seven species from two genera of Fagaceae. The results showed that no single element is the common resource currency across species, but that the reproductive strategy of each species is regulated by C, N, or P. Reproduction in Fagus crenata was limited by N but not by C, whereas in Quercus serrata it was co-limited by C and N. Among the seven Fagaceae species, there was a negative correlation between the thickness of the pericarp and the concentration of the total phenolics in the seed and pericarp, suggesting alternative strategies for developing defensive traits in ripening seeds with limited C-based resources. Overall, our results highlighted the diversity of resource allocation strategies to reproduction and defensive traits of Fagaceae species. To better understand the masting phenomenon at the population or community levels, comprehensive consideration of the diversity of resource allocation strategies among species is worth exploring in the future.",carbon; masting; nitrogen; phosphorus; plant defense,2023,38,2,10.1111/1440-1703.12350,0912-3814,10,77,218,1455,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Understanding rural and urban perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services for their blue carbon conservation strategies in the Philippines,"Seagrass meadows provide diverse ecosystem services that directly or indirectly benefit the coastal communities. Despite this, they are among the most threatened coastal ecosystems. Though coastal and marine conservation actions have progressed over the years, seagrasses received less attention compared with other more charismatic ecosystems such as coral reefs and mangroves. Among the influencing factors, the lack of societal recognition of what seagrasses are and their importance underlies the global crisis of seagrass conservation. Thus, in this study, we gathered rural and urban perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services, their threats, and management-related activities at the unit of barangay or village in the Philippines. Overall, rural respondents displayed higher awareness of seagrass ecosystem services than urban respondents. Socio-economic status and personal connection or direct experience to these services influenced their perceptions. Local-level threats were also perceived and recognizing these at the early onset can avoid severe habitat degradation. Though the role of seagrass blue carbon in climate change mitigation was barely discussed in local contexts, the impact of climate change-induced stressors on seagrass was perceived by the respondents. Thus, local stakeholders, practitioners, and policymakers have the opportunity to design future seagrass-focused management plans and programs in the era of climate change.",blue carbon; comparative analysis; Philippines; rural-urban perceptions; seagrass ecosystems,2023,38,4,10.1111/1440-1703.12325,0912-3814,18,137,200,1455,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Utility of chloroplast DNA haplotype data for ecological restoration using Fagus crenata seedlings in case of incomplete seed source information availability,"Forest trees species are often genetically adapted to local environmental conditions. Therefore, local seeds are recommended for ecological restoration. However, seedlings of broad-leaved tree species, such as Japanese beech (Fagus crenata), are limited in their commercial seedling production in Japan. Thus, long-distance transfer of seeds and/or seedlings is common. F. crenata's distinct geographical structure is well known; large-scale seed transfer may increase the risk of genetic disturbance. Several provenance trials of the species revealed that phenotypic traits such as leaf area and bud flush date differed latitudinally and/or between the Pacific Ocean side and the Japan Sea side. We investigated leaf size and bud flush date and identified the chloroplast DNA haplotype of trees planted in two provenance trials established in Hokkaido, Japan. We then examined whether cpDNA haplotype information is useful as a proxy in ecological restoration when using seedlings with incomplete seed source information. This study indicated that suitable seedlings could be selected based on chloroplast DNA haplotype information in F. crenata in the case of incomplete seed source information.",beech; bud flush; latitudinal cline; leaf area; provenance test,2023,38,2,10.1111/1440-1703.12351,0912-3814,21,157,172,1197,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION,Long Term Progress in Riparian Restoration with Concurrent Avian Declines in the Southern San Francisco Bay Area (CA),"The restoration of riparian habitats aims to provide habitat for birds and other environmental benefits; yet the evaluation of long-term outcomes is rare. To address this knowledge gap, we used bird and vegetation data from Coyote Creek Field Station (CCFS), in the southern San Francisco Bay Area, to assess the progress of two riparian revegetation projects (1987 Revegetation, 1993 Revegetation) over nearly two decades. Restoration success was measured by changes in 1) vegetation structure and composition, and 2) avian abundance, diversity, and community composition. We compared the two revegetated areas to a remnant riparian reference site and a managed floodplain overflow channel in three time periods (1996-1998, 2004-2006, 2012-2014) using ANOVA, Tukey's HSD tests, and beta diversity analysis of avian community composition. Over time, the restored areas became more similar to the remnant riparian reference site in four of seven indices. The avian community became more similar across the habitat areas over time, although differences remained. Migratory birds declined across all habitat areas, while resident and wintering birds declined in one revegetated habitat only. Overall we found that different types of data told different stories, indicating both convergence with the reference site and ongoing differences.

ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION,"Plant, Avian, and Butterfly Response to a Native-Grassland Restoration in Southern Texas","Non-native, invasive grasses can pose a threat to biodiversity in the southern U.S. Pennisetum ciliare (buffelgrass) is an example of an introduced invasive grass that has established in southwestern rangelands and negatively influenced biodiversity. Since its introduction, millions of hectares in the southwestern U.S. have been planted with, or invaded by, buffelgrass. Buffelgrass can form monocultures that not only reduce biodiversity but can also change ecosystem processes. Native-grassland restorations may be able to mitigate such negative impacts of non-native grasses. We con-ducted a study to document the response of herbaceous plants (grasses and forbs) and wildlife (grassland breeding birds, grassland wintering birds, and butterflies) to a 118-ha grassland restoration (involving prescribed fire, multiple discing and herbicide applications, and native-plant seeding) in La Salle County, Texas during 2013-2019. In general, we documented a numerical increase for all three taxa (native plants, birds, and butterflies) in species richness and relative abundance on the restoration site compared to a control. Our results suggest that native-grassland restoration is possible in a landscape dominated by buffelgrass. These restoration efforts can increase plant and wildlife diversity, although the time and expense required to achieve such responses are great.",biodiversity; buffelgrass; butterfly diversity; grassland bird diversity; non-native grasses,2022,40,1,10.3368/er.40.1.44,1543-4060,12,88,192,1377,5,NA,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION,Assessing the Social Benefits of Tree Planting by Smallholders in Vietnam: Lessons for Large-Scale Reforestation Programs,"In recent decades, Vietnam has embarked on several ambitious projects, including restoration of coastal mangroves and the expansion of national forest cover through large-scale tree planting efforts. Much of the work is being carried out by individual households, who now likely control a majority of planted productive forest land. Yet despite the strong role for smallholders, questions have been raised about the social benefits of their participation, and insufficient attention has been paid to whether these programs are truly aimed at restoration or more narrowly at plantation development only. This paper assesses several of Vietnam's recent tree-planting projects against the Society for Ecological Restoration's standards, particularly around social benefits, and concludes that Vietnam is failing on most measures, ranging from stakeholder engagement to natural capital benefits. Overall, smallholders mostly view the tree planting projects in terms of financial benefits from short rotation cycles for pulp and woodchip mills, which offer low value, few social benefits, and little ecological restoration potential. The paper argues that Vietnam would benefit from more engaged restoration activities that pay attention to social benefits for smallholders, ensuring more long-term sustainability for both people and forests.",Asia; participation; plantations; reforestation; social benefits,2021,39,1-Feb,NA,1543-4060,16,121,189,1337,5,NA,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

It can enhance stakeholder-driven management practices; excavate assumptions about management strategies; and improve understanding of failures and successes from restoration efforts. In the Puget Sound of Washington State, social science is beginning to play a larger role in ecosystem recovery. In this paper, we use a governance-oriented science-policy framework to assess the ways in which social science has gained structural support in the Puget Sound. We then compare this analysis to responses from client users of Puget Sound restoration science to identify the extent to which they perceive governance support for social science integration. We found that the Puget Sound region has substantively enhanced the governance structure for integrating social science in restoration and partner agencies have improved their ability to engage in meaningful dialogue around social science needs.

ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION,"Onto the Farm, into the Home: How Intrahousehold Gender Dynamics Shape Land Restoration in Eastern Kenya","While attention has been paid largely to forest restoration, meeting global land restoration pledges will require scalingup restoration of ecosystem services on agricultural land. This paper contributes to the literature on restoration practice and agricultural technology adoption, by shifting the focus onto the farm and considering the role of intrahousehold dynamics in the uptake of farmland restoration practices. We examine the intrahousehold decisions and gender relations surrounding the trial of two on-farm restoration practices: tree planting and planting basins; with over 2,500 farmers in the eastern drylands of Kenya. Combining results from household surveys, interviews and focus group discussions, our findings reveal that decisions over the uptake of restoration practices, although usually initiated by women who attend agricultural workshops, are often discussed between husband and wife and that multiple social dimensions intersect to shape men's and women's interest in, contribution to, and benefit from different practices. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that these intrahousehold relations are, in turn, shaped by women's participation in innovation processes and broader societal changes, particularly the outmigration of rural men. Based on these insights, we offer recommendations for improving the dissemination and uptake of on-farm restoration practices in eastern Kenya and achieving more inclusive and gender-equitable outcomes.",decision-making; labor; smallholder agriculture; technology adoption; women's agency,2021,39,1-Feb,NA,1543-4060,16,104,201,1468,5,NA,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION,Restoration of Urban Water Commons: Navigating Social-Ecological Fault Lines and Inequities,"The networked tank/lake system of Bengaluru has been created by human intervention, with a documented history as far back as the 9th century C.E. The construction and maintenance of the tanks was overseen by local chieftains, and supported by local communities, further managed by caste-based and gender-based systems of manual labor. With urban expansion, the lakes lost their importance as the primary sources of water, leading to large scale degradation. Land-use transformations impacted the socio-ecological commons landscape, exacerbating marginalization in nature-dependent communities such as grazers and fishers due to loss of livelihoods. State initiatives coupled with community interventions helped in revival of some lakes in the past decade, though others remain severely degraded. Privileged and underprivileged caste groups describe a very different picture of the past, demonstrating rather divergent perspectives on the way in which urbanization and lake revival has impacted their lives. Based on a case study of selected lakes in Bengaluru, we establish how social inclusions and exclusions are manifested through decision making on lake management. We also seek to understand how these hierarchies have changed in response to urbanization, with aspirations towards a rhetoric of restoration, but a focus on urban greening and recreational aesthetics in practice.

ECOLOGY,Alpine butterflies want to fly high: Species and communities shift upwards faster than their host plants,"Despite sometimes strong codependencies of insect herbivores and plants, the responses of individual taxa to accelerating climate change are typically studied in isolation. For this reason, biotic interactions that potentially limit species in tracking their preferred climatic niches are ignored. Here, we chose butterflies as a prominent representative of herbivorous insects to investigate the impacts of temperature changes and their larval host plant distributions along a 1.4-km elevational gradient in the German Alps. Following a sampling protocol of 2009, we revisited 33 grassland plots in 2019 over an entire growing season. We quantified changes in butterfly abundance and richness by repeated transect walks on each plot and disentangled the direct and indirect effects of locally assessed temperature, site management, and larval and adult food resource availability on these patterns. Additionally, we determined elevational range shifts of butterflies and host plants at both the community and species level. Comparing the two sampled years (2009 and 2019), we found a severe decline in butterfly abundance and a clear upward shift of butterflies along the elevational gradient. We detected shifts in the peak of species richness, community composition, and at the species level, whereby mountainous species shifted particularly strongly. In contrast, host plants showed barely any change, neither in connection with species richness nor individual species shifts. Further, temperature and host plant richness were the main drivers of butterfly richness, with change in temperature best explaining the change in richness over time. We concluded that host plants were not yet hindering butterfly species and communities from shifting upwards. However, the mismatch between butterfly and host plant shifts might become a problem for this very close plant-herbivore relationship, especially toward higher elevations, if butterflies fail to adapt to new host plants. Further, our results support the value of conserving traditional extensive pasture use as a promoter of host plant and, hence, butterfly richness.",Alps; altitudinal gradient; global warming; grazing; Lepidoptera; mountain biodiversity; plant-herbivore interactions; species range shifts; upslope shift,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3848,0012-9658,16,104,309,2125,9,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,An experimental test of the growth rate hypothesis as a predictive framework for microevolutionary adaptation,"The growth rate hypothesis (GRH) posits that the relative body phosphorus content of an organism is positively related to somatic growth rate, as protein synthesis, which is necessary for growth, requires P-rich rRNA. This hypothesis has strong support at the interspecific level. Here, we explore the use of the GRH to predict microevolutionary responses in consumer body stoichiometry. For this, we subjected populations of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus to selection for fast population growth rate (PGR) in P-rich (HPF) and P-poor (LPF) food environments. With common garden transplant experiments, we demonstrate that in HP populations evolution toward increased PGR was concomitant with an increase in relative phosphorus content. In contrast, LP populations evolved higher PGR without an increase in relative phosphorus content. We conclude that the GRH has the potential to predict microevolutionary change, but that its application is contingent on the environmental context. Our results highlight the potential of cryptic evolution in determining the performance response of populations to elemental limitation of their food resources.",Brachionus calyciflorus; contemporary evolution; ecological stoichiometry; experimental evolution; intraspecific genetic variation; phosphorus limitation; rapid adaptation; rotifera; zooplankton,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3853,0012-9658,15,109,166,1150,9,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Coat color mismatch improves survival of a keystone boreal herbivore: Energetic advantages exceed lost camouflage,"Climate warming is causing asynchronies between animal phenology and environments. Mismatched traits, such as coat color change mismatched with snow, can decrease survival. However, coat change does not serve a singular adaptive benefit of camouflage, and alternate coat change functions may confer advantages that supersede mismatch costs. We found that mismatch reduced, rather than increased, autumn mortality risk of snowshoe hares in Yukon by 86.5\% when mismatch occurred. We suggest that the increased coat insulation and lower metabolic rates of winter-acclimatized hares confer energetic advantages to white mismatched hares that reduce their mortality risk. We found that white mismatched hares forage 17-77 min less per day than matched brown hares between 0 \& DEG;C and -10 \& DEG;C, thus lowering their predation risk and increasing survival. We found no effect of mismatch on spring mortality risk, during which mismatch occurred at warmer temperatures, suggesting a potential temperature limit at which the costs of conspicuousness outweigh energetic benefits.",accelerometer; camouflage; coat color; energetic expenditure; foraging; Lepus americanus; phenological mismatch; snowshoe hare; survival; thermoregulation,2023,104,2,10.1002/ecy.3882,0012-9658,15,113,157,1076,10,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Cryptogam plant community stability: Warming weakens influences of species richness but enhances effects of evenness,"Community stability is a fundamental factor sustaining ecosystem functioning and is affected by species richness and species evenness. The Arctic is warming more rapidly than other biomes, and cryptogam plant species (specifically lichens and bryophytes in this study) are major contributors to tundra biodiversity and productivity. However, to our knowledge, the impacts of warming on cryptogam community stability and the underlying mechanisms have not been investigated. We conducted a 13-year summer warming experiment in mesic birch hummock tundra vegetation near Daring Lake in the continental interior of low Arctic Canada and recorded patterns of cryptogam species abundance in several different growing seasons. Warming decreased the stability of total community abundance, had no effects on species richness, but increased species evenness and species synchrony. Structural equation model analyses indicated that higher species richness was the principal factor associated with the stronger community abundance stability in the control plots and that this effect was driven primarily by a negative correlation with species synchrony. By contrast, higher species evenness was the principal factor associated with the weakened community abundance stability in the warming plots, and this effect was driven primarily by a positive correlation with species synchrony. Our study suggests that climate warming could reduce cryptogam plant community stability in low Arctic tundra and, therefore, decrease important ecosystem services, including carbon storage and food availability to caribou in northern regions.",biodiversity; bryophytes; global warming; lichens; species synchrony; tundra,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3842,0012-9658,15,116,227,1617,6,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Darwin's naturalization conundrum reconciled by changes of species interactions,"Although phylogenetic distance between native and exotic species has a close link with their interactions, it is still unclear how environmental stresses and species interactions influence the relationship between phylogenetic distance and biological invasions. Here we assessed the effect of invader-native phylogenetic distance on the growth of the invader (Symphyotrichum subulatum) under three levels of drought (no, moderate, or intense drought). Under no drought, interspecific competition between close relatives was the dominant process and native communities more closely related to the invader showed higher resistance to invasion, supporting Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. In contrast, under intense drought, facilitation between close relatives by mutualism with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) became more important, and the invader became more successful in their more closely related native communities, supporting the preadaptation hypothesis. The colonization rate of AMF of the invader was higher in more closely related native communities regardless of the drought treatment, but it was only positively related to invader biomass under intense drought. Therefore, the shift of species interactions from competition to facilitation may be ascribed to the promotion of AMF to invasion occurring under intense drought, which leads to the effect of closely related natives on the invader shifting from negative to positive. Our results provide a new angle to resolve Darwin's naturalization conundrum from the change of species interactions along a stress gradient, and provide important clues for invasion management when species interactions change in response to global climatic change.",arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; drought; invasion; light; phylogenetic distance; species interaction; species richness,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3850,0012-9658,9,79,239,1712,7,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes

Whether and how the resulting reductions in seed dispersal, seed predation, and browsing translate to changes in the tree composition is poorly understood. Here, we assess the effect of defaunation on the functional composition of communities of tree recruits in tropical rainforests in French Guiana. We selected eight sites along a gradient of defaunation, caused by differences in hunting pressure, in otherwise intact old-growth forests in French Guiana. We measured shifts in functional composition by comparing leaf and fruit traits and wood density between tree recruits (up to 5 cm diameter at breast height) and adults, and tested whether and how these compositional shifts related to defaunation. We found a positive relationship with defaunation for shifts in specific leaf area, a negative relationship for shifts of leaf toughness and wood density, and a weak relationship for shifts in fruit traits. Our results suggest that the loss of vertebrates affects ecological processes such as seed dispersal and browsing, of which browsing remains understudied. Even though these changes sometimes seem minor, together they result in major shifts in forest composition. These changes have long-term ramifications that may alter forest dynamics for generations.",functional composition; functional trait; hunting; leaf toughness; specific leaf area; wood density,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3872,0012-9658,14,102,212,1431,6,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Delayed trophic response of a marine predator to ocean condition and prey availability during the past century,"Understanding the response of predators to ecological change at multiple temporal scales can elucidate critical predator-prey dynamics that would otherwise go unrecognized. We performed compound-specific nitrogen stable isotope analysis of amino acids on 153 harbor seal museum skull specimens to determine how trophic position of this marine predator has responded to ecosystem change over the past century. The relationships between harbor seal trophic position, ocean condition, and prey abundance, were analyzed using hierarchical modeling of a multi-amino-acid framework and applying 1, 2, and 3 years temporal lags. We identified delayed responses of harbor seal trophic position to both physical ocean conditions (upwelling, sea surface temperature, freshwater discharge) and prey availability (Pacific hake, Pacific herring, and Chinook salmon). However, the magnitude and direction of the trophic position response to ecological changes depended on the temporal delay. For example, harbor seal trophic position was negatively associated with summer upwelling but had a 1-year delayed response to summer sea surface temperature, indicating that some predator responses to ecosystem change are not immediately observable. These results highlight the importance of considering dynamic responses of predators to their environment as multiple ecological factors are often changing simultaneously and can take years to propagate up the food web.",amino acid; Chinook salmon; Columbia River; harbor seal; Pacific herring; Phoca vitulina; Salish Sea; sea surface temperature; stable isotope; trophic position; Washington,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3865,0012-9658,17,110,202,1448,11,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Disorder or a new order: How climate change affects phenological variability,"Advancing spring phenology is a well documented consequence of anthropogenic climate change, but it is not well understood how climate change will affect the variability of phenology year to year. Species' phenological timings reflect the adaptation to a broad suite of abiotic needs (e.g., thermal energy) and biotic interactions (e.g., predation and pollination), and changes in patterns of variability may disrupt those adaptations and interactions. Here, we present a geographically and taxonomically broad analysis of phenological shifts, temperature sensitivity, and changes in interannual variability encompassing nearly 10,000 long-term phenology time series representing more than 1000 species across much of the Northern Hemisphere. We show that the timings of leaf-out, flowering, insect first-occurrence, and bird arrival were the most sensitive to temperature variation and have advanced at the fastest pace for early-season species in colder and less seasonal regions. We did not find evidence for changing variability in warmer years in any phenophase groups, although leaf-out and flower phenology have become moderately but significantly less variable over time. Our findings suggest that climate change has not to this point fundamentally altered the patterns of interannual phenological variability.",birds; deviation; flowers; insects; interannual variability; phenophase; plants; seasonality variance,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3846,0012-9658,11,76,186,1318,8,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,"Dispersal, kin aggregation, and the fitness consequences of not spreading sibling larvae","Dispersal has far-reaching implications for individuals, populations, and communities, especially in sessile organisms. Escaping competition with conspecifics and with kin are theorized to be key factors leading to dispersal as an adaptation. However, manipulative approaches in systems in which adults are sessile but offspring have behaviors is required for a more complete understanding of how competition affects dispersal. Here, we integrate a series of experiments to study how dispersal affects the density and relatedness of neighbors, and how the density and relatedness of neighbors in turn affects fitness. In a marine bryozoan, we empirically estimated dispersal kernels and found that most larvae settled within similar to 1 m of the maternal colony, although some could potentially travel at least 10s of meters. Larvae neither actively preferred or avoided conspecifics or kin at settlement. We experimentally determined the effects of spreading sibling larvae by manipulating the density and relatedness of settlers and measuring components of fitness in the field. We found that settler density reduced maternal fitness when settler neighbors were siblings compared with when neighbors were unrelated or absent. Genetic markers also identified very few half sibs (and no full sibs) in adults from the natural population, and rarely close enough to directly interact. In this system, dispersal occurs over short distances (meters) yet, in contrast with expectations, there appears to be limited kinship between adult neighbors. Our results suggest that the limited dispersal increases early offspring mortality when siblings settle next to each other, rather than next to unrelated conspecifics, potentially reducing kinship in adult populations. High offspring production and multiple paternity could further dilute kinship at settlement and reduce selection for dispersal beyond the scale of 10s of meters.",bryozoan; dispersal behavior; dispersal kernel; kin competition; kin structure; marine,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3858,0012-9658,12,88,281,1924,6,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Electrolytes on the prairie: How urine-like additions of Na and K shape the dynamics of a grassland food web,"The electrolytes Na and K both function to maintain water balance and membrane potential. However, these elements work differently in plants-where K is the primary electrolyte-than in animals-where ATPases require a balanced supply of Na and K. Here, we use monthly factorial additions of Na and K to simulate bovine urine inputs and explore how these electrolytes ramify through a prairie food web. Against a seasonal trend of increasing grass biomass and decreasing water and elemental tissue concentrations, +K and +Na plots boosted water content and, when added together, plant biomass. Compared to control plots, +Na and +K plots increased element concentrations in above-ground plant tissue early in summer and decreased them in September. Simultaneously, invertebrate abundance on Na and K additions were sequentially higher and lower than control plots from June to September and were most suppressed when grass was most nutrient rich. K was the more effective plant electrolyte, but Na frequently promoted similar changes in grass ionomes. The soluble/leachable ions of Na and K showed significant ability to shape plant growth, water content, and the 15-element ionome, with consequences for higher trophic levels. Grasslands with high inputs of Na and K-via large mammal grazers or coastal aerosol deposition-likely enhance the ability of plants to adjust their above-ground ionomes, with dramatic consequences for the distribution of invertebrate consumers.",abundance; fertilization experiment; food web; grassland; ionomics; potassium; resorption; sodium; translocation,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3856,0012-9658,19,108,220,1469,9,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Embolism resistance explains mortality and recovery of five subtropical evergreen broadleaf trees to persistent drought,"Subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests (SEBF) are experiencing and expected to suffer more frequent and severe drought events. However, how the hydraulic traits directly link to the mortality and recovery of SEBF trees remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a drought-rewatering experiment on tree seedlings of five dominant species to investigate how the hydraulic traits were related to tree mortality and the resistance and recovery of photosynthesis (A) and transpiration (E) under different drought severities. Species with greater embolism resistance (P-50) survived longer than those with a weaker P-50. However, there was no general hydraulic threshold associated with tree mortality, with the lethal hydraulic failure varying from 64\% to 93\% loss of conductance. The photosynthesis and transpiration of tree species with a greater P-50 were more resistant to and recovered faster from drought than those with lower P-50. Other plant traits could not explain the interspecific variation in tree mortality and drought resistance and recovery. These results highlight the unique importance of embolism resistance in driving carbon and water processes under persistent drought across different trees in SEBFs. The absence of multiple efficient drought strategies in SEBF seedlings implies the difficulty of natural seedling regeneration under future droughts, which often occurs after destructive disturbances (e.g., extreme drought events and typhoon), suggesting that this biome may be highly vulnerable to co-occurring climate extremes.",drought-rewatering; embolism resistance; PLC threshold; recovery; subtropical forest; tree mortality,2023,104,2,10.1002/ecy.3877,0012-9658,15,119,222,1553,6,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Experimental evidence that host species composition alters host-pathogen dynamics in a ranavirus-amphibian assemblage,"Losses in biodiversity can alter disease risk through changes in host species composition. Host species vary in pathogen susceptibility and competence, yet how changes in diversity alter host-pathogen dynamics remains unclear in many systems, particularly with respect to generalist pathogens. Amphibians are experiencing worldwide population declines linked to generalist pathogens, such as ranavirus, and thus represent an ideal group to investigate how host species composition affects disease risk. We conducted experiments in which amphibian larvae of three native species (Pacific tree frogs, Pseudacris regilla; Cascades frogs, Rana cascadae; and Western toads, Anaxyrus boreas) were exposed to ranavirus individually (in the laboratory) or as assemblages (in outdoor mesocosms). In a laboratory experiment, we observed low survival and high viral loads in P. regilla compared to the other species, suggesting that this species was highly susceptible to the pathogen. In the mesocosm experiment, we observed 41\% A. boreas mortality when alone and 98\% mortality when maintained with P. regilla and R. cascadae. Our results suggest that the presence of highly susceptible species can alter disease dynamics across multiple species, potentially increasing infection risk and mortality in co-occurring species.",amphibians; amplification; biodiversity; host composition; ranarvirus; susceptibility,2023,104,2,10.1002/ecy.3885,0012-9658,13,117,186,1315,6,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Extinction dynamics: The interplay of species traits and the spatial scales of metapopulation declines,"Global changes can lead to species declines and extinctions through their impacts on species habitats at two distinct spatial scales: habitat destruction, in which individual habitat patches are destroyed by land-use change or natural disasters, and habitat degradation, in which larger scale changes, such as nitrogen deposition or climate change, lower mean population abundances across landscapes. We developed a theory showing that, even when these two forms of global change have an identical impact on a species' total amount of habitat, they have qualitatively different consequences for species dynamics and extinction. Using metapopulation theory and simulations, we found distinct impacts of these global changes characterized through several responses: the rate at which populations are lost from the remaining patches, extinction thresholds, and the duration of extinction debts. Habitat degradation causes a faster decline in species populations when habitat reduction is low, making it particularly detrimental for rare species. Habitat destruction has smaller impacts for low habitat reduction, but shows clear thresholds beyond which it surpasses degradation's negative impact; the location and steepness of the threshold depends on species dispersal, with poor dispersers having steeper thresholds. These results highlight the challenge of using population monitoring to assess the consequences of global changes and predict consequences of further change: extinction trajectories cannot be predicted due to thresholds (habitat destruction) and lagged dynamics that lead to extinction debts (habitat degradation). Our research clarifies why the impacts of one type of global change may poorly predict the impacts of the other and suggests general rules for predicting the long-term impacts of global changes based on species traits.",conservation; extinction debts; global change; habitat loss; metapopulation; population decline,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3840,0012-9658,14,102,263,1849,6,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Functional traits' annual variation exceeds nitrogen-driven variation in grassland plant species,"Effective application of functional trait approaches to ecological questions requires understanding the patterns of trait variation within species as well as between them. However, few studies address the potential for intraspecific variation to occur on a temporal basis and, thus, for trait-based findings to be contingent upon sampling year. To quantify annual variation in the functional traits of grassland plant species, we measured specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, plant height, and chlorophyll content in 12 shortgrass prairie plant species. We repeated these measurements across 4 years, both in long-term nitrogen addition plots and in corresponding control plots. Three of the four traits showed significant year-to-year variation in a linear mixed model analysis, generally following a pattern of more acquisitive leaf economics spectrum traits in higher rainfall years. Furthermore, two of the measured traits responded interactively to nitrogen addition and sampling year, although only one, leaf dry matter content, showed the expected pattern of stronger nitrogen responses in high rainfall years. For leaf dry matter content and specific leaf area, trait responses to sampling year were larger than responses to the nitrogen addition treatment. These findings illustrate that species' functional traits can respond strongly to environmental changes across years, and thus that trait variation in a species or community is likely to extend beyond the values and patterns observed in any single year.",annual variation; drought; functional trait; grassland; intraspecific trait variation; NutNet; nutrients,2023,104,2,10.1002/ecy.3886,0012-9658,11,96,224,1527,7,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Fungivorous nematodes drive microbial diversity and carbon cycling in soil,"Soil bacteria and fungi mediate terrestrial biogeochemical cycling, but we know relatively little about how trophic interactions influence their community composition, diversity, and function. Specifically, it is unclear how consumer populations affect the activity of microbial taxa they consume, and therefore the interaction of those taxa with other members of the microbial community. Due to its extreme diversity, studying trophic dynamics in soil is a complex feat. Seeking to address these challenges, we performed a microcosm-based consumer manipulation experiment to determine the impact of a common fungal-feeding nematode (Aphelenchus avenae) on soil microbial community composition, diversity, and activity (e.g., C cycling parameters). Fungivory decreased fungal and bacterial alpha-diversity and stimulated C and N cycling, possibly via cascading impacts of fungivory on bacterial communities. Our results present experimental evidence that soil trophic dynamics are intimately linked with microbial diversity and function, factors that are key in understanding global patterns in biogeochemical cycling.",carbon cycling; fungivory; microbiome; soil; trophic dynamics,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3844,0012-9658,10,74,151,1118,5,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,High sensitivity of tropical forest birds to deforestation at lower altitudes,"Habitat conversion is a major driver of tropical biodiversity loss, but its effects are poorly understood in montane environments. While community-level responses to habitat loss display strong elevational dependencies, it is unclear whether these arise via elevational turnover in community composition and interspecific differences in sensitivity or elevational variation in environmental conditions and proximity to thermal thresholds. Here we assess the relative importance of inter- and intraspecific variation across the elevational gradient by quantifying how 243 forest-dependent bird species vary in sensitivity to landscape-scale forest loss across a 3000-m elevational gradient in the Colombian Andes. We find that species that live at lower elevations are strongly affected by loss of forest in the nearby landscape, while those at higher elevations appear relatively unperturbed, an effect that is independent of phylogeny. Conversely, we find limited evidence of intraspecific elevational gradients in sensitivity, with populations displaying similar sensitivities to forest loss, regardless of where they exist in a species' elevational range. Gradients in biodiversity response to habitat loss thus appear to arise via interspecific gradients in sensitivity rather than proximity to climatically limiting conditions.",avian community; elevational gradients; forest conversion; montane tropics; tropical conservation,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3867,0012-9658,11,77,182,1332,5,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Net effects of life-history traits explain persistent differences in abundance among similar species,"Life-history traits are promising tools to predict species commonness and rarity because they influence a population's fitness in a given environment. Yet, species with similar traits can have vastly different abundances, challenging the prospect of robust trait-based predictions. Using long-term demographic monitoring, we show that coral populations with similar morphological and life-history traits show persistent (decade-long) differences in abundance. Morphological groups predicted species positions along two, well known life-history axes (the fast-slow continuum and size-specific fecundity). However, integral projection models revealed that density-independent population growth (lambda) was more variable within morphological groups, and was consistently higher in dominant species relative to rare species. Within-group lambda differences projected large abundance differences among similar species in short timeframes, and were generated by small but compounding variation in growth, survival, and reproduction. Our study shows that easily measured morphological traits predict demographic strategies, yet small life-history differences can accumulate into large differences in lambda and abundance among similar species. Quantifying the net effects of multiple traits on population dynamics is therefore essential to anticipate species commonness and rarity.",commonness; comparative demography; coral reefs; fitness; functional traits; rarity; recruitment; reproduction; trade-offs,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3863,0012-9658,13,100,175,1375,9,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Pollinator type strongly impacts gene flow within and among plant populations for six Neotropical species,"Animal pollinators directly affect plant gene flow by transferring pollen grains between individuals. Pollinators with restricted mobility are predicted to limit gene flow within and among populations, whereas pollinators that fly longer distances are likely to promote genetic cohesion. These predictions, however, remain poorly tested. We examined population genetic structure and fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) in six perennial understory angiosperms in Andean cloud forests of northwestern Ecuador. Species belong to three families (Gesneriaceae, Melastomataceae, and Rubiaceae), and within each family we paired one insect-pollinated with one hummingbird-pollinated species, predicting that insect-pollinated species have greater population differentiation (as quantified with the F-ST statistic) and stronger FSGS (as quantified with the S-P statistic) than hummingbird-pollinated species. We confirmed putative pollinators through a literature review and fieldwork, and inferred population genetic parameters with a genome-wide genotyping approach. In two of the three species pairs, insect-pollinated species had much greater (>2-fold) population-level genetic differentiation and correspondingly steeper declines in fine-scale genetic relatedness. In the Gesneriaceae pair, however, F-ST and S-P values were similar between species and to those of the other hummingbird-pollinated plants. In this pair, the insect pollinators are euglossine bees (as opposed to small bees and flies in the other pairs), which are thought to forage over large areas, and therefore may provide similar levels of gene flow as hummingbirds. Overall, our results shed light on how different animal pollination modes influence the spatial scale of plant gene flow, suggesting that small insects strongly decrease genetic cohesion.",2b-RAD sequencing; Andean cloud forest understory; fine-scale spatial genetic structure; hummingbird pollination; insect pollination; neotropical plants; population genetic structure,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3845,0012-9658,15,105,246,1829,7,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Reintroduced megaherbivores indirectly shape small-mammal responses to moonlight,"Moonlight structures activity patterns of many nocturnal species. Bright moonlight often limits the activity of nocturnal prey, but dense vegetation weakens this effect. Using 8 years of live-trapping data, we asked whether reintroduced megaherbivores (Bison bison) indirectly altered moonlight avoidance by small mammals in tallgrass prairies. In plots with bison, plants intercepted 20\% less light, allowing more moonlight to reach ground level. During nights with no moonlight, Peromyscus maniculatus activity was similar in plots with and without bison. During nights with peak moonlight, P. maniculatus activity was four times greater in plots without bison compared to plots with bison. Conversely, Microtus ochrogaster activity was twice as great during full moons compared to new moons, but only in plots with bison. We also equipped a subset of traps with temperature sensors to estimate trap-entry time. Although M. ochrogaster was more active on bright nights, most activity occurred before moonrise or after moonset, avoiding periods of bright moonlight. We conclude that megaherbivores play an unappreciated but important indirect role in tallgrass prairies by inducing behavioral shifts in other animal species. Because overlap in activity patterns can predict the likelihood of predator-prey encounters, such activity shifts have important implications for trophic interactions throughout restored prairie food webs. Additional work to understand interspecific and intraspecific variation in response to moonlight may improve efforts to forecast changes in community assembly due to restoration and land-use change.",activity timing; bison; habitat restoration; Microtus ochrogaster; moonlight; Peromyscus leucopus; Peromyscus maniculatus; tallgrass prairie,2023,104,2,10.1002/ecy.3884,0012-9658,8,80,231,1631,8,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Stronger fertilization effects on aboveground versus belowground plant properties across nine US grasslands,"Increased nutrient inputs due to anthropogenic activity are expected to increase primary productivity across terrestrial ecosystems, but changes in allocation aboveground versus belowground with nutrient addition have different implications for soil carbon (C) storage. Thus, given that roots are major contributors to soil C storage, understanding belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) and biomass responses to changes in nutrient availability is essential to predicting carbon-climate feedbacks in the context of interacting global environmental changes. To address this knowledge gap, we tested whether a decade of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization consistently influenced aboveground and belowground biomass and productivity at nine grassland sites spanning a wide range of climatic and edaphic conditions in the continental United States. Fertilization effects were strong aboveground, with both N and P addition stimulating aboveground biomass at nearly all sites (by 30\% and 36\%, respectively, on average). P addition consistently increased root production (by 15\% on average), whereas other belowground responses to fertilization were more variable, ranging from positive to negative across sites. Site-specific responses to P were not predicted by the measured covariates. Atmospheric N deposition mediated the effect of N fertilization on root biomass and turnover. Specifically, atmospheric N deposition was positively correlated with root turnover rates, and this relationship was amplified with N addition. Nitrogen addition increased root biomass at sites with low N deposition but decreased it at sites with high N deposition. Overall, these results suggest that the effects of nutrient supply on belowground plant properties are context dependent, particularly with regard to background N supply rates, demonstrating that site conditions must be considered when predicting how grassland ecosystems will respond to increased nutrient loading from anthropogenic activity.",belowground net primary productivity; nitrogen; Nutrient Network; nutrient pollution; phosphorus; root response,2023,104,2,10.1002/ecy.3891,0012-9658,13,107,277,2006,6,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY,Temperature-habitat interactions constrain seasonal activity in a continental array of pitfall traps,"Activity density (AD), the rate at which animals collectively move through their environment, emerges as the product of a taxon's local abundance and its velocity. We analyze drivers of seasonal AD using 47 localities from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) both to better understand variation in ecosystem rates like pollination and seed dispersal as well as the constraints of using AD to monitor invertebrate populations. AD was measured as volume from biweekly pitfall trap arrays (ml trap(-1) 14 days(-1)) Pooled samples from 2017 to 2018 revealed AD extrema at most temperatures but with a strongly positive overall slope. However, habitat types varied widely in AD's seasonal temperature sensitivity, from negative in wetlands to positive in mixed forest, grassland, and shrub habitats. The temperature of maximum AD varied threefold across the 47 localities; it tracked the threefold geographic variation in maximum growing season temperature with a consistent gap of ca. 3 degrees C across habitats, a novel macroecological result. AD holds potential as an effective proxy for investigating ecosystem rates driven by activity. However, our results suggest that its use for monitoring insect abundance is complicated by the many ways that both abundance and velocity are constrained by a locality's temperature and plant physiognomy.",activity density; habitat; temperature; thermal performance curve; thermal performance theory,2023,104,1,10.1002/ecy.3855,0012-9658,12,100,204,1357,5,NA,350,12,No,375,325,no,yes,yes

It is critical to integrate dimensions related to well-being into research about vulnerable communities??? capacities and strategies for coping and adapting to such crises. Here, we investigate water-related risks to health and well-being using a subjectivity lens, a particularly useful tool for understanding community-level resilience to lesser-known stressors and crisis impacts. To inform this study, we used households??? self-reported water issues in Cape Town, South Africa???s low-income areas from before the pandemic, in addition to community responses during the pandemic. The findings show how inadequate access to water and sanitation affects people???s health and well-being, both directly by exposure to wastewater and impaired hygiene, and indirectly by creating stress and social conflict, and undermining subsistence gardening and medical self-care. However, our study also illustrates how grassroots-led responses to the COVID-19 crisis address these vulnerabilities and identify priorities for managing water to support well-being. The results demonstrate two ways that subjective perceptions of well-being can help to promote resilience: first, by identifying stressors that undermine community well-being and adaptive capacity; and second, by voicing community experiences that can help to guide crisis responses and initiatives critical for adapting to social-ecological shocks.

ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Visions for development and management of urban green and blue infrastructure: a citizen's perspective,"Ongoing urbanization leads to problems such as densification, loss of biodiversity, and social injustice in cities. For increasing urban populations, green???blue infrastructure (GBI) is an important element in compact cities contributing to human health, well-being, and the provision of important ecosystem services. We analyzed responses from two open-ended questions about visions, ideas, and topics for the development and management of GBI important for citizens of the city of Leipzig, Germany. The questions were part of an online survey accompanying the development of the local GBI planning strategy: Master Plan Green. The strategy is focusing on five guiding themes that are leading local and global debates about sustainable and resilient cities: biodiversity, climate adaptation, environmental justice, health, and sustainable mobility. We categorize citizens' ideas and suggestions, summarize frequent problems and conflicts, and link ideas and visions to the five guiding themes. As the last step, we discuss citizens' suggestions in order to minimize conflicts in GBI and to identify deficits in present local planning. Major problems and conflicts that were addressed by respondents relate to quality, usability, other users, activities, and safety and security of GBI. Numerous suggestions aimed to tackle these problems, for example, by designating separate use areas, adding naturalness, improving maintenance, and enhancing facilities. A range of ideas and suggestions were based on diverging expectations underpinning the challenge of matching heterogeneous demands of GBI users in an equitable fashion. Linking these suggestions to the five guiding themes reveals that most ideas are covered by one or several guiding themes and are considered in local planning strategies. However, findings also demonstrate that increasing the quantity of Leipzig's GBI is a central request from respondents. Sociocultural and economic aspects as well as conflicting demands among citizens should further be central to GBI planning to avoid injustice and achieve sustainability objectives. This analysis gives insights into opinions and visions of citizens regarding the development of the city's GBI network and thus substantiates major strategic and planning themes leading global and local urban strategies toward sustainable cities.

ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Challenges to incorporating social and economic factors into cumulative effects assessments in Canada?s marine conservation areas,"The cumulative effects of human stressors are threatening marine ecosystems. While spatial management tools such as marine conservation areas can help mitigate cumulative effects, several decision-making challenges remain. A limited availability of information and lack of knowledge, inconsistent management approaches, and ineffective consideration of social-ecological interactions hinders current cumulative effects assessment and management efforts. We examined if and how ocean managers assess cumulative effects and incorporate them into their management practices. A survey of the three Canadian federal departments responsible for marine conservation areas was conducted, and focused on the extent to which social and economic factors are considered. Managers seemed to favor ecological factors over social and economic ones when evaluating cumulative effects, such as when defining the spatial and temporal scales to use in their assessments. Managers also indicated a need for greater access to social and economic data and information to improve their assessment and management decisions. Lastly, the lack of a standardized cumulative effects assessment framework and fragmented management approaches appeared to limit managers??? ability to adequately incorporate social and economic factors into assessments. The survey results indicated that a cumulative effects assessment framework that explicitly includes social and economic factors in addition to an enhanced understanding of the suite of factors that influence social-ecological interactions should be developed.

ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Mapping and characterizing social-ecological land systems of South America,"Humans place strong pressure on land and have modified around 75\% of Earth???s terrestrial surface. In this context, ecoregions and biomes, merely defined on the basis of their biophysical features, are incomplete characterizations of the territory. Land system science requires classification schemes that incorporate both social and biophysical dimensions. In this study, we generated spatially explicit social-ecological land system (SELS) typologies for South America with a hybrid methodology that combined data -driven spatial analysis with a knowledge-based evaluation by an interdisciplinary group of regional specialists. Our approach embraced a holistic consideration of the social-ecological land systems, gathering a dataset of 26 variables spanning across 7 dimensions: physical, biological, land cover, economic, demographic, political, and cultural. We identified 13 SELS nested in 5 larger social-ecological regions (SER). Each SELS was discussed and described by specific groups of specialists. Although 4 environmental and 1 socioeconomic variable explained most of the distribution of the coarse SER classification, a diversity of 15 other variables were shown to be essential for defining several SELS, highlighting specific features that differentiate them. The SELS spatial classification presented is a systematic and operative characterization of South American social-ecological land systems. We propose its use can contribute as a reference framework for a wide range of applications such as analyzing observations within larger contexts, designing system-specific solutions for sustainable development, and structuring hypothesis testing and comparisons across space.

ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Multistakeholder platforms for natural resource governance: lessons from eight landscape-level cases,"Multistakeholder platforms (MSPs) are the subject of increasing attention and investment in the domain of collaborative natural resource governance, yet evidence-based guidance is slim on policy and investment priorities to leverage the MSP approach. We provide a comparative analysis of eight landscape-level MSPs spanning seven countries (Peru, Brazil, India, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and a cross-border case from Kenya and Somalia), representing a diversity of resource systems covering forests, rangelands, and multiuse agricultural landscapes. Applying an adapted social-ecological systems framework, our synthesis identifies the influence of these MSPs on patterns of stakeholder interaction and draws implications for the design and organization of MSPs that are both appropriate and effective. From the cases, we distill lessons addressing: (1) how to design an MSP in relation to the governance context, including the fit between institutional and ecological dimensions of the system and with attention to cross-scale linkages; (2) how to implement inclusive processes that address power inequities, including through capacity building and procedural rules; and (3) how to support adaptive learning to expand the MSP's influence over time, including monitoring outcomes, adapting the scope of stakeholder engagement, and investing in MSP durability.",adaptive learning; collaborative governance; inclusion; landscape approaches; multistakeholder dialogue; power relations; resilience,2022,27,2,10.5751/ES-13168-270202,1708-3087,11,100,188,1353,7,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Expectations about voluntary efforts in collaborative governance and the fit with perceived prerequisites of intrinsic motivation in Sweden?s ecosystem-based moose management system,"Collaborative governance regimes may be vulnerable because of dependency on stakeholders??? voluntary engagement and efforts. This study focuses on the Swedish moose management system, a multi-level collaborative governance regime inspired by the ecosystem approach. Self-determination theory is used to explore perceived prerequisites of basic needs for intrinsic motivation across sub-groups of stakeholder representatives who are engaged across different social-ecological contexts. Questionnaire data collected among representatives at two governance levels, moose management groups (n = 624) and moose management units (n = 979), were subjected to two-step cluster analysis. The analyses revealed two sub-groups of representatives, characterized by differences in species composition and land ownership structure: managers of multi-ungulate areas and managers of large-carnivore areas. In several respects, these groups significantly differed in how they perceived the prerequisites. This included prerequisites of perceived competence with regard to their need for knowledge of topics and usefulness of monitoring methods, perceived autonomy operationalized as possibilities to perform their tasks with sufficient time, resources, and support from their organizations, and perceived relatedness to different groups of actors. Further efforts should be made to understand the conditions required for representatives to energize and direct their behavior. The institutional system must better fit the needs of stakeholder representatives across various local contexts, otherwise the space for local voluntary engagement might be hampered.",collaborative governance; ecosystem approach moose management; perceived prerequisites of basic needs; self-determination theory,2022,27,2,10.5751/ES-13257-270220,1708-3087,22,181,216,1642,4,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Indigenous nations at the confluence: water governance networks and system transformation in the Klamath Basin,"Collaborative approaches to complex water quality problems can facilitate collective action across large watersheds with multiple, overlapping political jurisdictions, including Indigenous territories. Indigenous nations are increasingly engaging in collaborative water governance, in part, as a response to colonial legacies that have excluded Indigenous peoples from watershed management. This study uses social network analysis to explore emerging Klamath water governance networks. We seek to understand ongoing system transformation in contemporary water governance through tribal engagement in multi-jurisdictional water governance networks, from a system of Indigenous dispossession and exclusion (late 1800s-1980s) toward a yet unrealized system that centers Indigenous peoples. To envision the meaningful inclusion of Indigenous peoples in adaptive water governance, we first draw on criteria established by Indigenous water governance scholars. Then, we examine a snapshot of Indigenous participation in water quality governance in the Klamath Basin that focuses on the Karuk Tribe from 2018-2019. Specifically, Karuk tribal managers identified 21 different science-policy coalitions that they worked with on a range of water quality issues. We then used social network analysis methods to generate a network in which 210 different organizations were linked through co-membership in one or more coalitions. Our findings indicated that the Karuk and other Klamath Basin tribes play a central role in Klamath water quality governance and were not relegated to ``stakeholder status.{''} Using a community detection algorithm, we found that tribes were key players in the central technical working group that emerged through network connections. Applying a log-linear statistical model, we also observed a high level of mixing in the network across all types of organizations, including tribes. Finally, through a multi-membership model, we found that tribes were more strongly connected to influential network actors than NGOs, despite environmental NGOs being more numerous. These analyses demonstrate how tribal engagement can activate key mechanisms for water quality governance transformation, e.g., shifting information flows and changing system structures to more effectively center Indigenous nations. In addition to insights from social network analysis, we also highlight the limitations of technical water management in supporting the deep connections held between Indigenous peoples and their waters that are central to Indigenous water governance.",collaborative management; collective action; environmental governance; Indigenous water governance; Karuk Tribe; log-linear models; multimembership model; polycentric governance; social network analysis; walktrap community detection; water quality,2022,27,4,10.5751/ES-12942-270404,1708-3087,15,110,353,2566,11,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Fisheries co-management in a digital age? An investigation of social media communications on the development of electronic monitoring for the Northeast US groundfish fishery,"Fisheries regulators have increasingly incorporated video monitoring systems, also known as electronic monitoring, into programs for fisheries data collection and documentation of bycatch. Electronic monitoring has recently emerged as one potential solution for fisheries monitoring and catch accounting in the Northeast United States, where fisheries regulators will soon require all commercial groundfish trips to be monitored either by electronic monitoring or human observers. Fisheries managers, scientists, and industry stakeholders have cooperated to some extent to solve some of the logistical and technical hurdles of electronic monitoring through recent pilot projects and coordination meetings. Whereas prior research has assessed the outcomes of stakeholder interactions in traditional venues (e.g., fisheries council meetings, workshops), we interrogated the dynamic connections between stakeholders in discussions about electronic monitoring policies and initiatives in the social media environment. Using social network and content analysis, we examined electronic monitoring-related discourse among Northeast U.S. fisheries stakeholders on Twitter over a period of 2 years. This research represents the initial phase of a multi-year study on co-management aspects of decision-making in Northeast U.S. federally managed fisheries. Our initial findings revealed that environmental NGOs and federal science agency organizations drive the discourse on electronic monitoring, but information-sharing between environmental NGOs, government, and industry as a form of cooperation appears to take shape with some fishing industry and community organizations joining the conversation. These preliminary results suggest that cross-stakeholder communications are prevalent, but expanding discursive networks will be necessary in realizing diverse participation in cooperative fisheries projects, particularly those aimed at implementing new approaches to fisheries science and management, as in the case of electronic monitoring for the Northeast groundfish fishery.",co-management; electronic monitoring; fisheries; social media; social network analysis,2022,27,3,10.5751/ES-13474-270313,1708-3087,24,173,269,2071,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Geospatial patterns and models of subsistence land use in rural Interior Alaska,"Alaska Native people and rural Alaskans rely on subsistence harvesting of wild resources for their well-being. This study integrates publicly-available data from >30 Interior Alaskan communities to examine the geospatial patterns of subsistence and develop model-based maps of subsistence land use for the region. Through analysis and identification of lands important for subsistence, this study provides a tool to inform sound decision-making on land use and facilitate communication among land users. We found that most contemporary subsistence land use (approx. 70\%) occurred within areas that have been traditionally used for generations. The size of subsistence use areas varied widely among communities (approx. 50-25,000 km(2)) and was directly related to total population. Subsistence land use varied both by resource type and by season, which reflects differences in resource availability and harvesting strategies. The spatial patterns of subsistence land use were strongly influenced by accessibility, which differed between remote and road-connected communities. Our logistic regression models showed that subsistence land use was largely predictable by distance to communities, distance to main travel corridors (roads and/or rivers), distance to lakes (for remote communities), and population size. Probability maps of subsistence use were generated and classified into used and unused areas with accuracies from 83-86\%. Results suggest a large spatial extent (353,771 km(2)) of subsistence land use in Interior Alaska, comprising >60\% of the land area of this sparsely-populated region.

ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,"Socioeconomic determinants of mangrove exploitation and management in the Pangani River Estuary, Tanzania","Mangrove forests in Tanzania are gazetted as state forest reserves, implying that exploitation is controlled by the state. However, their continued degradation and loss is largely associated to the inadequate enforcement of management measures against uncontrolled extractive exploitation to support local livelihoods. Local management institutions are therefore advocated to enhance mangrove conservation. This study explored socioeconomic determinants of exploitation patterns and management of mangroves in the Pangani River Estuary, using two coastal communities (Bweni and Pangani Magharibi) as case study sites. Data were collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, household questionnaires, and field observations. Quantitative data were analyzed for both descriptive and statistical inferences, while qualitative information was subjected to content analysis. Residence time of household, household main occupation, household size, and cost of alternatives to mangroves as a source of domestic fuel were all factors positively associated with mangrove resource use. The two communities differed in their perceptions on the role of local institutions in management of mangroves. Over half of respondents (56\%) in Bweni agreed that interventions by Beach Management Units (BMUs) enhanced mangrove conditions, whereas only about 16\% of the respondents in Pangani Magharibi had similar perceptions. Overall, 55\% of the respondents were not impressed with the performance of government institutions in implementing conservation measures for sustainable use of mangroves.

ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Collective action in the area-wide management of an invasive plant disease,"Area-wide management (AWM) is a strategy for invasive plant pests and diseases in which management actions are coordinated across property boundaries to target the entire pest or pathogen population in an area. Because some people may benefit from the actions of others without bearing the costs, but group-level contributions are required to achieve effective control, AWM suffers from free-riding, yet it has rarely been studied as a collective action problem. To foster collective action for the management of huanglongbing (HLB), California citrus stakeholders have adopted two distinct institutional approaches: Psyllid Management Areas (PMAs), in which coordinated treatments are voluntary, and Pest Control Districts (PCDs), in which coordinated treatments are mandatory. Through a survey distributed to citrus stakeholders in Southern California and a regression analysis of participation levels in AWM over nine seasons, we assess the impact that individual perceptions, institutional approaches, and group-level determinants have had on collective action. Our results show that although citrus stakeholders are confident about the benefits of AWM, they are aware of collective action problems and identified the lack of participation as the main barrier to AWM. Group size, grove size, and heterogeneity in grove size were found to significantly impact collective action. In addition, our analysis shows that the two institutional approaches that were developed for AWM have followed a different trajectory over time, leading to a discussion of the determinants that may enable and sustain collective action for invasive species management.",area-wide management; collective action; huanglongbing; invasive species; plant health,2022,27,2,10.5751/ES-13217-270212,1708-3087,11,74,238,1650,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ECOLOGY LETTERS,The significance of partial migration for food web and ecosystem dynamics,"Migration is ubiquitous and can strongly shape food webs and ecosystems. Less familiar, however, is that the majority of life cycle, seasonal and diel migrations in nature are partial migrations: only a fraction of the population migrates while the other individuals remain in their resident ecosystem. Here, we demonstrate different impacts of partial migration rendering it fundamental to our understanding of the significance of migration for food web and ecosystem dynamics. First, partial migration affects the spatiotemporal distribution of individuals and the food web and ecosystem-level processes they drive differently than expected under full migration. Second, whether an individual migrates or not is regularly correlated with morphological, physiological, and/or behavioural traits that shape its food-web and ecosystem-level impacts. Third, food web and ecosystem dynamics can drive the fraction of the population migrating, enabling the potential for feedbacks between the causes and consequences of migration within and across ecosystems. These impacts, individually and in combination, can yield unintuitive effects of migration and drive the dynamics, diversity and functions of ecosystems. By presenting the first full integration of partial migration and trophic (meta-)community and (meta-)ecosystem ecology, we provide a roadmap for studying how migration affects and is affected by ecosystem dynamics in a changing world.",dispersal; eco-evolutionary dynamics; ecosystem processes; foraging; meta-ecosystem; nutrient cycling; resource flow; spatial subsidies; traits; trophic interactions,2023,26,1,10.1111/ele.14143,1461-023X,11,73,203,1445,10,NA,150,10,No,175,125,yes,no,yes

Our study objectives were to (1) quantify whether anthropogenic pressures measurably impacted the structural complexity of Arasbaran forests and (2) determine which structural complexity indices were most sensitive to anthropogenic pressures in Arasbaran forests. We identified and sampled three study sites with high, moderate, and low levels of anthropogenic pressures and used nine forest structural indices to develop structural complexity indices. High anthropogenic pressure resulted in aggregated tree distribution, uniformity in tree sizes, and less heterogeneous forest structure. The structural indices particularly sensitive to anthropogenic pressure were diameter differentiation, height differentiation, Gini coefficient, and structural diversity. Structural complexity appears to be a useful method for quantifying the impacts of anthropogenic pressure on montane deciduous forests.

We tested the accuracy of a MaxEnt species distribution model for white-rimmed shingle lichen (Fuscopannaria leucosticta) in New Brunswick, Canada, and proposed an additional decision support-tool that matches the species probability of occurrence (PO) to possible management actions. The model was tested using two years of new field observations. Classification trees were used to define four groups across the range of PO values. Chi-squared tests were used to test the accuracy of predictions in each class.

ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY,Sustainability evaluation for a circular maize-pig system driven by indigenous microbes: a case study in Northeast China,"Sustainable agricultural development is a topic of global concern aiming at satisfying food demand of the growing population while reducing impact on environment. Circular agriculture has become a promising development pattern with the advantages of complementing environmental resources, replacing feedback from outside system, and processing waste of bottom of system, etc. This study combined economic analysis, life cycle assessment and emergy accounting to evaluate sustainability of an integrated maize-pig system (IS) driven by indigenous microbes in Northeast China, compared with separated maize and pig system (SS). IS reduced input of concentrate feed, coal, vaccines, disinfectants, fertilizer and labor by 14.35\%, 100\%, 46.11\%, 100\%, 60.1\% and 60.8\% driven by indigenous microbes. Economic analysis results showed that IS has 82.88\% higher profit than that of SS. The sum of potential environmental impacts of IS was lower than SS for 80.65\% according to lifecycle assessment. The emergy results revealed that IS performed better sustainability. Internal feedback emergy for fertilizer and local resources for maize straw increasing of IS significantly improved emergy efficiency. The reduction resulted in nonrenewable resources decreased 33.01\% than that of SS, and increased renewable resources by 67.81\%, which reduced environmental load ratio of IS by 60.08\% of IS. Meanwhile, these factors were the primary factors generating higher sustainability of IS.

ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY,Heat wave mitigation of ecosystems in mountain areas - a case study of the Upper Yangtze River basin,"Background Natural ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, can mitigate heat waves, but research on heat wave mitigation in mountain ecosystems is lacking. Considering the upper reaches of the Yangtze River basin (URYB) as the study area, we first divided the URYB into mountainous and non-mountainous areas based on a digital elevation model (DEM). Then, we used temperature to identify heat waves and used the temperature and humidity index to identify suitable days. Finally, the differences between mountainous and non-mountainous areas were compared, and regional development strategies are proposed. Result (1)The frequency and duration of heat waves increased by 0.433/y (P < 0.1), 0.07/y (P < 0.05), while the number of suitable days in June, July, and August gradually decreased slightly by 0.0096/y (P < 0.1), 0.0125/y (P < 0.1), 0.004/y (P < 0.1), respectively from 1986 to 2015. (2)The average monthly number of suitable days was the highest in mountainous areas during the summer from 1986 to 2015. Mountainous areas have an advantage in mitigating heat waves owing to landform-based changes in the local climate. (3)In addition to the landform, altitude was the main factor responsible for mitigating heat waves in mountainous areas. Conclusion Parts of the plateau and whole mountain areas were found to be best for avoiding extremely high temperatures based on the number of suitable summer days from 1986 to 2015.

Here we used a historical ecology approach on a rare Mediterranean peat-bog to reconstruct ecological successions for the last 4 millennia. The reconstruction is used to explore the role of geomorphic thresholds, climate changes, and anthropogenic perturbations as drivers of the ecosystem trajectory in the frame of the projected aridification of the climate. Our findings highlight how the superimposition of pastoral disturbances to river incision, has exacerbated ecosystem sensitivity to climate changes.

ECOSYSTEMS,Frost-Associated Defoliation in Populus tremuloides Causes Repeated Growth Reductions Over 185 years,"Climate change is causing a shift to earlier spring budburst in deciduous temperate trees, which may predispose them to greater risk of damage from growing season frosts. Populus tremuloides may be particularly vulnerable to growing season frosts, which can defoliate entire canopies and damage woody tissue. These growing season frost events may shift in frequency under continued climate change and alter a disturbance regime that disproportionately impacts deciduous, cold-sensitive vegetation. We used Populus tremuloides tree cores from 14 sites across the montane and subalpine forests of Utah, USA, to identify characteristic tree rings, namely `white rings', associated with growing season frost damage over the period 1767-2016. Early growing season frost was estimated using a frost intensity index using local data sourced from 22 long-term weather stations and was correlated with white ring occurrence. Over the last 150 years, the frequency of white rings was between 5 and 6\% of all years. Growing season frost occurrence was similar in northern and southern Utah and highly synchronous across stands indicating widespread defoliation. Populus tremuloides radial growth declined nearly 40\% during years of frost-associated defoliation. Our results highlight a severe disturbance that disproportionately impacts Populus tremuloides.

ECOSYSTEMS,Herbivore Dung Promotes Plant Litter Decomposition Rate in a Semi-arid Grassland Ecosystem,"The decomposition of plant litter and animal dung is the key processes of nutrient cycling and has been studied in a wide range of grassland ecosystems. However, most studies focus on the separate processes of either plant litter or animal dung decomposition, while the interactions between these two processes, which occur in grazed grassland ecosystems, are rarely studied. We conducted an experiment in a semi-arid grassland in Central Inner Mongolia, to examine the mass loss rates and chemical composition changes of two plant litter species and three herbivore dung types separately or in combination over a 2-year period. Twenty litterbag treatments were used to represent 2 treatments of plant litter only, 6 treatments of herbivore dung only at two addition levels, and 12 treatments of litter and dung combinations. We found that horse dung had the biggest mass loss rate, followed by cattle dung and sheep dung, either separately or mixed with plant litter. Dung addition promoted the mass loss, nitrogen release and fiber fraction (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) loss of plant litter, and the promotion was strongest for cattle dung, weakest for sheep dung, and stronger at high dung addition levels and in the early stages. However, the effect of litter addition on dung decomposition, a negative effect, was significant only when the dung proportion was low in the litter and dung mixture (that is, in the treatment of 10 g litter + 6 g dung). Furthermore, a significant positive non-additive effect of mixing litter and dung on their total mass loss was detected for the mixture at a litter:dung ratio of 10:6, the ratio in the major grazing area of the grassland. Our findings suggest that mixture of herbivore dung with plant litter, as in actual grassland ecosystems, promotes litter decomposition, and the composition of the litter and dung in mixture, though it may inhibit dung decomposition, due to the changes in chemical stoichiometry of decomposing materials and biophysical microenvironment by the mixing. It is necessary to incorporate the non-additive effect of litter and dung mixture in modeling carbon and nutrient cycling of grassland ecosystems.",litter quality; dung-litter interactions; dung; litter ratio; non-additive effect; mass loss; nutrient release,2023,26,3,10.1007/s10021-022-00784-3,1432-9840,12,90,347,2184,7,NA,250,10,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ECOSYSTEMS,Large-Scale Quantification and Correlates of Ungulate Carrion Production in the Anthropocene,"Carrion production is one of the most crucial yet neglected and understudied processes in food webs and ecosystems. In this study, we performed a large-scale estimation of the maximum potential production and spatial distribution of ungulate carrion biomass from five major sources in peninsular Spain, both anthropogenic (livestock, big game hunting, roadkills) and natural (predation, natural mortality). Using standardized ungulate carrion biomass (kg/year/100km(2)) estimates, we evaluated the relationship between ungulate carrion production and two ecosystem-level factors: global human modification (GHM) and primary productivity (NDVI). We found that anthropogenic carrion sources supplied about 60 times more ungulate carrion biomass than natural sources (mean = 90,172 vs. 1533 kg/year/100km(2), respectively). Within anthropogenic carrion sources, livestock was by far the major carrion provider (91.1\% of the annual production), followed by big game hunting (7.86\%) and roadkills (0.05\%). Within natural carrion sources, predation of ungulates provided more carrion (0.81\%) than natural mortality (0.13\%). Likewise, we found that the spatial distribution of carrion differed among carrion sources, with anthropogenic carrion being more aggregated in space than natural carrion. Our models showed that GHM was positively related to carrion production from livestock and roadkills, and that wild ungulate carrion supplied by natural sources and big game hunting was more frequently generated in more productive areas (higher NDVI). These findings indicate a disconnection between the main ungulate carrion source (livestock) and primary productivity. Ongoing socio-economic changes in developed countries (for example increase of intensive livestock husbandry and rewilding processes) could lead to additional alteration of carrion production processes, with potential negative impacts at the community and ecosystem levels. Overall, we highlight that carrion biomass quantification should be considered a crucial tool in evaluating ecosystem health and delineating efficient ecosystem management guidelines in the Anthropocene.",big game hunting; carrion biomass quantification; global human modification; livestock; primary productivity; roadkill; terrestrial ecosystems; ungulates,2023,26,2,10.1007/s10021-022-00763-8,1432-9840,11,92,287,2143,8,NA,250,10,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ECOSYSTEMS,"Pyric Herbivory and the Nexus Between Forage, Fire and Native and Introduced Large Grazing Herbivores in Australian Tropical Savannas","Earth's tropical savannas typically support high biomass of diverse grazing herbivores that depend on a highly fluctuating resource: high-quality forage. An annual wet-dry cycle, fire and herbivory combine to influence forage quality and availability throughout the year. In the savannas of northern Australia, a depauperate suite of large native (marsupial) herbivores (wallaroos {[}Osphranter spp.] and the agile wallaby {[}Notamacropus agilis]) compete for resources with non-native large herbivores introduced in the late nineteenth century, particularly bovines (feral and managed cattle {[}Bos spp.] and feral water buffalo [}Bubalus bubalis]) that now dominate the landscape. Anecdotal reports of recent population declines of large macropods and negative impacts of bovines highlight the need to better understand the complex relationship between forage, fire and abundance of native and introduced large herbivores. The pyric herbivory conceptual model, which posits complex feedbacks between fire and herbivory and was developed outside Australia, predicts that native and introduced large herbivores will both respond positively to post-fire forage production in Australian savannas where they co-occur. We used grazing exclosures, forage biomass and nutrient analyses and motion-sensor camera-trapping to evaluate the overall robustness of the pyric herbivory model in the Australian context, specifically whether forage quantity and quality are impacted by herbivory, season and fire activity, and which forage attributes most influence large grazing herbivore abundance. Forage quantity, as measured by live, dead and total herbaceous biomass and proportion of biomass alive, was higher inside herbivore exclosures, even at relatively low densities of herbivores. Forage quality, as measured by fibre content, was not affected by herbivory, however, crude protein content of live herbaceous biomass was greater outside herbivore exclosures. Recent fire was an important predictor of all measures of forage quantity and quality. Recent fire occurrence decreased overall quantity (biomass) but increased quality (decreased fibre content and increased crude protein content); late dry season fires resulted in forage with the highest crude protein content. The predictions of the pyric herbivory conceptual model are consistent with observations of the feeding behaviour of introduced bovines and some large macropods in northern Australian savannas, lending support to the global generality of pyric herbivory in fire-prone grassy biomes.",agile wallaby; camera trap; forage crude protein; herbivore exclosure; feral cattle; forage fibre; macropod; marsupial; forage nutrients; wallaroo; feral water buffalo,2023,26,3,10.1007/s10021-022-00781-6,1432-9840,19,133,353,2550,11,NA,250,10,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ECOSYSTEMS,"Sedimentary Organic Carbon and Nitrogen Sequestration Across a Vertical Gradient on a Temperate Wetland Seascape Including Salt Marshes, Seagrass Meadows and Rhizophytic Macroalgae Beds","Coastal wetlands are key in regulating coastal carbon and nitrogen dynamics and contribute significantly to climate change mitigation and anthropogenic nutrient reduction. We investigated organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks and burial rates at four adjacent vegetated coastal habitats across the seascape elevation gradient of Cadiz Bay (South Spain), including one species of salt marsh, two of seagrasses, and a macroalgae. OC and TN stocks in the upper 1 m sediment layer were higher at the subtidal seagrass Cymodocea nodosa (72.3 Mg OC ha(-1), 8.6 Mg TN ha(-1)) followed by the upper intertidal salt marsh Sporobolus maritimus (66.5 Mg OC ha(-1), 5.9 Mg TN ha(-1)), the subtidal rhizophytic macroalgae Caulerpa prolifera (62.2 Mg OC ha(-1), 7.2 Mg TN ha(-1)), and the lower intertidal seagrass Zostera noltei (52.8 Mg OC ha(-1), 5.2 Mg TN ha(-1)). The sedimentation rates increased from lower to higher elevation, from the intertidal salt marsh (0.24 g cm(-2) y(-1)) to the subtidal macroalgae (0.12 g cm(-2) y(-1)). The organic carbon burial rate was highest at the intertidal salt marsh (91 +/- 31 g OC m(-2) y(-1)), followed by the intertidal seagrass, (44 +/- 15 g OC m(-2) y(-1)), the subtidal seagrass (39 +/- 6 g OC m(-2) y(-1)), and the subtidal macroalgae (28 +/- 4 g OC m(-2) y(-1)). Total nitrogen burial rates were similar among the three lower vegetation types, ranging from 5 +/- 2 to 3 +/- 1 g TN m(-2) y(-1), and peaked at S. maritimus salt marsh with 7 +/- 1 g TN m(-2) y(-1). The contribution of allochthonous sources to the sedimentary organic matter also decreased with elevation, from 72\% in C. prolifera to 33\% at S. maritimus. Our results highlight the need of using habitat-specific OC and TN stocks and burial rates to improve our ability to predict OC and TN sequestration capacity of vegetated coastal habitats at the seascape level. We also demonstrated that the stocks and burial rates in C. prolifera habitats were within the range of well-accepted blue carbon ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and salt marshes.",seascape; blue carbon; seagrass; salt marsh; Cadiz bay; caulerpa,2023,26,4,10.1007/s10021-022-00801-5,1432-9840,24,185,341,2066,6,NA,250,10,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Determination of stomatic density, index, and area as exposition biomarkers of pollution in Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Poaceae)","Until not so long ago, Antarctica was considered to be a polar region practically pristine. The Antarctic Peninsula has the highest concentration of scientific stations from different countries. Anthropogenic activity has caused alterations in the Antarctic ecosystems directly affecting terrestrial vegetation. This fact requires the finding of biomarkers in native plants to estimate the effects of human impact. Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Poaceae) is the unique native grass described so far for Antarctica and was used for multiple investigations. In this study, plants were collected on Carlini scientific station, 25 de Mayo (King George) Island, Potter Peninsula, South Shetland Islands. Thus, the main objective planned consists of the evaluation of leaf stomata-related parameters as pollution biomarkers. The results of the stomatic index (SI), density (SD), and area (SA) were shown at sites with different levels of human impact (close and far away from the scientific station). It was found that the correlation between SD and SI, on the adaxial side of the leaves, resulted in a good biomarker for estimating the degree of anthropogenic impact in each studied area.",Deschampsia antarctica; Stomata; Biomarker's pollution; Antarctica,2022,31,8,10.1007/s10646-022-02589-5,0963-9292,17,130,178,1182,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOTOXICOLOGY,Assessment of the toxicity of weathered petroleum hydrocarbon impacted soils to native plants from a site in the Canadian Subarctic,"Remedial guidelines for petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) in soil aid in the mitigation of risks to human health and the environmental. However, some remediation guidelines may overestimate the potential for adverse effects to native plant species, contributing to unnecessary remedial efforts in attempts to meet the guidelines. At sites where PHC-contaminated soils undergo weathering, some PHCs may persist but with decreased bioavailability to organisms. In this study, the toxicity of both coarse and fine-grained subarctic soils, contaminated with weathered PHCs were assessed using five native plant species (Picea mariana, Achillea millefolium, Alnus viridis, Elymus trachycaulus and Salix bebbiana). Soil toxicity tests were conducted in a growth chamber with parameters set to simulate the site's subarctic climate conditions. Reference toxicant tests using boric acid were conducted to provide confidence in the interpretation of the results for the PHC-contaminated soils, and also provide new information on the sensitivities of the four boreal species to boric acid. All plants exhibited reduced growth and germination rates as boric acid concentrations increased. Despite exceeding the Canada-wide standard guidelines for Fraction 3 PHCs, field-collected contaminated soils had no significant negative impacts on the growth (i.e., length, dry weight and emergence) of any of the plant species tested.",Ecotoxicology; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Weathered contaminants; Subarctic soils; Reference toxicant; Toxicity assessment,2022,31,8,10.1007/s10646-022-02585-9,0963-9292,20,131,200,1411,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOTOXICOLOGY,Waterborne exposure to avobenzone and octinoxate induces thyroid endocrine disruption in wild-type and thr alpha a(-/-) zebrafish larvae,"Avobenzone and octinoxate are frequently used as organic ultraviolet filters, and these chemicals are widely detected in water. This study evaluated the potential of avobenzone and octinoxate to disrupt thyroid endocrine system in wild-type and thyroid hormone receptor alpha a knockout (thr alpha a(-/-)) zebrafish embryo/larvae. Following a 120 h exposure to various concentrations of avobenzone and octinoxate, larvae mortality and developmental toxicity in wild-type and thr alpha a(-/-) fish were assessed. Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels as well as transcriptional levels of ten genes associated with the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were measured in wild-type fish. Significantly lower larvae survival rate in thr alpha a(-/-) fish exposed to >= 3 mu M avobenzone and octinoxate suggests that the thyroid hormone receptor plays a crucial role in the toxic effects of avobenzone and octinoxate. A significant increase in the deio2 gene level in avobenzone-exposed zebrafish supports the result of an increased ratio of T3 to T4. Significant decrease of T4 level with upregulation of trh, tsh beta, and tshr genes indicates feedback in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to maintain hormonal homeostasis. Our observation indicates that exposure to avobenzone and octinoxate affects the thyroid hormone receptor and the feedback mechanisms of the HPT axis.",Avobenzone; Development; Knockout; Octinoxate; Thyroid endocrine disruption; Zebrafish,2022,31,6,10.1007/s10646-022-02555-1,0963-9292,18,136,204,1391,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

This study reports the effects, including genetic damage, of accumulations of trace metals on Liza aurata, which is used as a bio-indicator species, in the Payas coast of Iskenderun Bay, north-eastern Mediterranean by COMET Assay. L. aurata were seasonally collected from a sampling site and a reference site for one year. Physicochemical parameters in water and trace metals in the tissues of fish collected from these sites were determined by electrochemical techniques. High DNA damage frequency in L. aurata was observed along the Payas coast of Iskenderun Bay compared to the reference site because of pollutants. The detected high levels of Cd, Pb, Fe and Cu accumulation in L. aurata exceed the maximum levels allowed by the national and international limit values. Significant positive correlations between Cd, Pb, Hg, Cr, Fe, Zn, and Cu accumulations and DNA damage parameters were observed in the present study. Additionally, we first reported the successful use of the electrochemical technique in the determination of trace metal concentrations in mullet. Moreover, L. aurata constitutes a key tool as a sentinel organism for biomonitoring of coastal ecosystems.",Metals; DNA damage; Comet assay; Liza aurata,2022,31,9,10.1007/s10646-022-02591-x,0963-9292,16,113,200,1297,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOTOXICOLOGY,Toxicity of lanthanides on various fish cell lines,"The growing use of Lanthanides in new technologies has increased their anthropogenic releases into the aquatic environment over the last decades. However, knowledge on their ecotoxicological impacts is still incomplete, especially with regard to biological effects of Lanthanides mixtures and the possible regular variation in toxicity along the Lanthanides series. The present study evaluated the individual toxicity of all Lanthanides and the toxicity of mixtures of three of them, namely Neodymium (Nd3+), Gadolinium (Gd3+), and Ytterbium (Yb3+) on Danio rerio fibroblast-like cells (ZF4). Individual and mixtures toxicity of Neodymium (Nd3+) and Ytterbium (Yb3+) were also assessed on Danio rerio hepatic cells (ZFL) and Oncorhynchus mykiss epithelial cells (RTgill-W1). The measured Lanthanide concentrations were close to the nominal ones in the culture media of ZF4, ZFL, and RTgill-W1 cells (85-99\%). A toxic impact was observed on the three fish cell lines exposed to all Lanthanides tested individually. RTgill-W1 appeared as the less sensitive cells, compared to the two others. Four Lanthanides, Erbium (Er3+), Thulium (Tm3+), Ytterbium (Yb3+) and Lutetium (Lu3+) showed a higher toxicity than the others on ZF4 cells but no correlation could be established between the toxicity of Lanthanides and the order of the elements within the Lanthanides series. Exposures to binary mixtures highlighted the presence of synergistic effects on cell viability for all cell lines.",Aquatic ecotoxicology; Lanthanide; Mixture effect; Fish cell line; Cytotoxicity,2022,31,7,10.1007/s10646-022-02574-y,0963-9292,8,50,217,1482,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Does persistent organic pollutant PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate) negative impacts on the aquatic invertebrate organism, Astacus leptodactylus {[}Eschscholtz, 1823]","Highly persistent perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is an industrial fluorinated organic chemical with significant bioaccumulation and biomagnification properties. The purpose of this study was to determine the toxic effects of sublethal PFOS on the aquatic invertebrate organism, narrow-clawed crayfish {[}Astacus leptodactylus Eschscholtz, 1823]. The 96 h LC50 value was determined as 48.81 mg/L (34.19-63.68 mg/L) with probit analysis. The sublethal experimental design was formed into four groups solvent control (DMSO, dimethyl sulphoxide), non-treated control group, and 1/10 (5 mg/L) and 1/100 (0.5 mg/L) of 96 h LC50 of PFOS, and crayfish were exposed for 48 h, 7 d, and 21 d under laboratory conditions. Total haemocyte counts (THCs) decreased, while the haemolymph total antioxidant status (TAS) values increased (p < 0.05) after exposure to 0.5 and 5 mg/L PFOS for 48 h, 7 d, and 21 d. Haemolymph total oxidative stress (TOS) levels significantly increased at 5 mg/L PFOS concentration (p < 0.05). Catalase (CAT) activities increased at both concentrations after 48 h and 7 d and then returned to control levels after 21 d; whereas superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities did not change in muscle tissue (p > 0.05). GPX and CAT activities decreased, but SOD activity increased in hepatopancreas tissue (p < 0.05). SOD activity at both concentrations and CAT activity at 5 mg/L PFOS exposure decreased in gill tissue, while GPX activity increased at both concentrations of 48 h and 7 d and returned to control values on day 21 of exposure. Histopathological alterations were detected in hepatopancreas and gill tissues. Lamellar deformations, epithelial hyperplasia, and haemocytic infiltrations were observed in the gill tissues, whereas tubular degeneration, tubule loss, necrosis, and lesions in the hepatopancreas tissues were the major recorded alterations. As a result, the sublethal concentrations of PFOS have toxic effects on crayfish and histologically cause tissue damage. Our findings also support a better understanding of the early toxicological effects of PFOS in freshwater ecosystems. Also, it could be concluded that A. leptodactylus is a reliable model for examining histopathological alterations and differences in enzyme activities together with the haemolymph findings in toxicology studies amid aquatic species.",Perfluorooctane sulfonate; Haemolymph analysis; Histopathology; Oxidative stress; Astacus leptodactylus,2022,31,8,10.1007/s10646-022-02579-7,0963-9292,18,165,353,2374,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,Arctic charr phenotypic responses to abrupt generational scale temperature change: an insight into how cold-water fish could respond to extreme climatic events,"Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an organism to express multiple phenotypes in response to the prevailing environmental conditions without genetic change, may result in a response to anthropogenic environmental change. Given that increasing climate variability is predicted to pose a greater risk than directional climate change, we tested the effect of a water temperature differential of 4 degrees C on the Arctic charr phenotypic within a single generation. We demonstrate that Arctic charr phenotype can respond rapidly and markedly to an environmental temperature cue. The plastic response to different temperature regimes comprised a shift in the mean expressed phenotype but also coupled with a reduction in the between-individual phenotypic variation in the expressed head shape. The magnitude of shape difference between temperature conditions was cumulative over time but the rate of divergence diminished as fish became larger. Overall, individuals raised in the elevated temperature treatment expressed a phenotype analogous to a benthivorous ecotype of this species, rather than that of the parental pelagic feeding form. The response of cold-water freshwater species to temperature change is likely to be an interaction between the capacity of the organism for phenotypic plasticity, the mean speed of change in the environment, and the degree of short interval variation in the environment.",Mean phenotype; Phenotypic variance; Phenotypic variability; Evolutionary ecology; Morphology; Temperature,2023,106,"5, SI",10.1007/s10641-022-01363-0,0378-1909,22,159,207,1410,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,Detecting acoustically tagged green sturgeon in the Northeast Pacific Ocean,"Identifying critical habitats is challenging for a relatively rare species like green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), which spends most of its life at sea. We used a fixed array and an autonomous underwater vehicle (Slocum glider) as monitoring platforms to detect acoustically tagged green sturgeon in the coastal ocean. For 1 month in 2018 during spring (May) and again in fall (September-October), both methods were used simultaneously to detect sturgeon bearing uniquely coded transmitters. For the fixed array, nine acoustic receivers were interspersed with three sentinel transmitters along a single line of latitude off Winchester Bay, OR. For the glider, two 3-week deployments were completed along the coast of Oregon from nearshore to the 200-m depth contour. For both deployments, the glider flew a zig-zag course southward as it profiled the water column and collected water quality information. Tagged green sturgeon and sentinel transmitters were successfully detected by both the fixed array and the glider. The fixed array provided indications of onshore and offshore movement, while the glider indicated along-shore movement. Although more green sturgeon were detected by the fixed array, the glider provided information on potential sturgeon aggregation areas. In addition, this application of the underwater glider may provide a unique opportunity for public engagement, teaching, and outreach.",Autonomous underwater vehicle; Marine; Habitat; Acoustic telemetry; Migration; Distribution,2023,106,"5, SI",10.1007/s10641-022-01353-2,0378-1909,10,75,208,1415,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,"Environmental conditions influence exploration, antipredation behavior, and fin condition in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)","Differences in environmental conditions experienced throughout development are known to produce differences in phenotypic traits. Hatchery and wild fish often express different phenotypic traits driven, at least in part, by differences in the early rearing environment. These differences can influence their ability to adapt and survive in the wild. In this study, we compared juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that were reared at high and low density, with and without complex structure, and used a psychological test to evaluate impacts on behavior, including motivation, exploration, and what we consider to be an antipredation response. Juvenile Chinook salmon are generally motivated to be near conspecifics. In the test, fish were presented with one of three stimuli (conspecifics, structure, or nothing) across an aversive area from their starting location (start box). Fish reared in low density spent more time in the start box and had a longer latency to leave the start box (for those that left without bolting) compared to those reared in high density, regardless of the stimulus presented. However, there was no impact of structure on these behaviors, although those reared with structure were more likely to either bolt out of or stay in the start box. Rearing treatment also influenced caudal fin condition such that fish reared in low density had larger and more pointed fins than fish in high density and fish reared with structure had larger and more symmetrical fins than those reared without structure. We speculate that reduced density and rearing with structure led to fish with enhanced antipredation responses which may confer adaptive advantages if released in a novel environment and possibly improve their survival upon release in the wild.",Density; Structure; Hatchery fish; Exploration; Conspecifics,2023,106,"5, SI",10.1007/s10641-022-01356-z,0378-1909,15,143,276,1784,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,Opportunistic camera surveys provide insight into discrete foraging behaviours in nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum),"Elasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates and rays) are some of the most morphologically and behaviourally diverse vertebrates on the planet, demonstrating a wide range of feeding strategies. The nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) is a large, widely distributed shark species which is commonly associated with tropical and subtropical reefs worldwide; yet it remains vastly understudied relative to other large species. To advance our understanding of nurse shark behaviour and ecology, we used opportunistic video observations gathered throughout the islands of Turks and Caicos from September 2020 to April 2021. We made 233 observations from 78 camera deployments and identified five behaviours, four of which were attributed to foraging. Stationary feeding behaviour was most commonly observed and strongly influenced by habitat type with a greater number of observations occurring on sand banks relative to reef habitat. Unique to this study was the first empirical description of pectoral positioning, by which individuals can position their body relative to a food-source through mobilization of the pectoral fins. We discuss these findings in relation to mechanical processes and kinematics, and the implications of expanding our knowledge of the functional role nurse sharks play in the transfer of energy across tropical seascapes.",Behaviour; BRUV; Foraging; Nurse shark,2023,106,1,10.1007/s10641-022-01366-x,0378-1909,14,119,195,1337,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,"Relationship between submerged aquatic vegetation, turbidity, and fish distribution in a large shallow fluvial lake","Many freshwater ecosystems worldwide are threatened by increasing water turbidity and extensive submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) loss, with potential consequences on aquatic communities. Such changes in water quality and habitat features affect the relative abundance of species in the community and/or the composition of ecological guilds altering the trophic network. Here, we estimated the relationship between fish species and both SAV abundance and water quality in Lake St. Pierre (Quebec, Canada), a shallow fluvial lake of the St. Lawrence River. To explain the association between the fish community and environmental variables, we performed multiple linear regressions on fish abundance, species richness, and Shannon diversity calculated at 133 stations, along a gradient of turbidity, temperature, and SAV abundance. In addition, we estimated the relationship between dominant fish species abundance and environmental variables by using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Species richness and abundance were positively related to SAV. Turbidity was negatively related to fish abundance, but had an unexpected positive effect on diversity (Shannon and species richness). By quantifying the association between fish species and habitat features, this study contributes to a better understanding of mechanisms structuring fish communities in changing environments.",Species diversity; Species richness; Abundance; Fish community; Enhanced vegetation index; Remote sensing; Saint-Lawrence River,2023,106,1,10.1007/s10641-022-01359-w,0378-1909,15,115,190,1381,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,"Relationships between egg size and maternal size, life history forms, and habitats of Greenlandic Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus)","Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus {[}L.] complex) has been widely used as a model system for studies in evolutionary ecology because of its diversity in feeding ecology, habitat use, life history forms, and associated morphologies observed in matured individuals. However, we still know relatively little about traits exhibited early in life of the species, although the trait diversity of matured individuals may largely be shaped during development. Egg size is a key determinant of various traits exhibited early in life. Therefore, describing egg size variation within- and between-individuals as well as the link between egg size and adult traits will be a useful step in understanding the early life trait diversity of Arctic charr. Here, using Greenlandic Arctic charr, which includes alternative life history forms (i.e. anadromous and resident) and spawning habitat use (i.e. lake and river spawner), we described egg size variation (i.e. clutch-mean egg diameter and withinclutch variation) and explored the link between egg size variation and female body length, life history form, and spawning habitats. As in many other fishes, clutch-mean egg diameter increased with female body length. No significant effect of other female traits on clutch mean-egg diameter was detected, suggesting that female body size variation could be a direct cause of early life history trait variation. On the other hand, we found that the degree of within-clutch variation of the anadromous life history form was higher than that of the resident life history form. The pattern could be interpreted in an adaptive context. For instance, given that the anadromous life history form tends to be semelparous, anadromous females could decrease the likelihood of complete reproductive failure by producing variable-sized offspring within a clutch since at least some offspring are expected to be matched to the prevailing environment.",Arctic charr; Clutch-mean egg size; Within-clutch variation; Life history theory,2023,106,"5, SI",10.1007/s10641-022-01374-x,0378-1909,18,131,291,1919,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,Short-term space use of small-bodied fish in coastal flats ecosystems in The Bahamas: an acoustic telemetry study using the smallest commercially available transmitters,"Nearshore fish communities in marine flats ecosystems are recognised as being key for early life stages of socio-economically valued fish species, as well as small-bodied forage fishes, yet little is known about the spatial ecology of these fishes. Recent advances in acoustic telemetry have allowed for the tagging of small fish. Here, we used the smallest commercially available acoustic transmitter to tag and track several juvenile or small-bodied species of a flats fish assemblage in Rock Sound, Eleuthera, The Bahamas. Fish species tagged included juvenile bonefish (Albula vulpes; n=2), juvenile great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda; n=22), juvenile redfin needlefish (Strongylura notata; n=21), and yellowfin mojarra (Gerres cinereus; n=20), and their movements were recorded by twenty hydrophone receivers deployed in nearshore flats habitats extending -3 km along the shoreline. Yellowfin mojarra had the highest site fidelity and were detected most commonly during diurnal periods. Juvenile bonefish had the lowest site fidelity and travelled throughout the array area, primarily detected at night (albeit sample size was low). Juvenile barracuda and juvenile redfin needlefish were mobile but tended to spend the majority of their time near several receivers. Juvenile barracuda were least present during the morning but were detected during all other times of the day. Similarly, juvenile redfin needlefish had the lowest residency during the morning and were more resident during the other period. Some of the space use patterns observed appeared to be correlated with water temperature (e.g. for barracuda there were more detections at warmer water temperatures). This preliminary study reveals that it is possible to tag and track small flats fishes which opens the door for longer-term and more fine-scale (e.g. with 2-day positioning) studies to understand habitat associations and environmental drivers of behaviour although receiver detection range was somewhat limited in these shallow and dynamic habitats.",Marine; Coastal; Habitat; Telemetry; Spatial ecology,2023,106,"2, SI",10.1007/s10641-022-01360-3,0378-1909,23,168,297,2029,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,The first examination of the movements of flats fishes to evaluate the effectiveness of marine protected areas in Cuba,"Information on fish movements is essential for effective spatial management, including marine-protected areas. Unfortunately, this information is missing for many species of management interest. This lack of information is true for fish species that support the economically important, catch and release, recreational flats fishery in Cuba. Here, we present findings of the first assessment of movements of flats fishes in and around marine-protected areas on the south coast of Cuba, based on mark-recapture and local knowledge. Data were sufficient for analysis for bonefish, which showed high levels of fidelity to the protected areas in which they were tagged. Tarpon showed larger-scale movements and were less fidelic to the protected areas in which they were tagged. Findings suggest that these marine-protected areas are sufficient in size to protect a large portion of the areas used by bonefish, with the exception of likely spawning migrations. The life history and movement patterns of tarpon mean that protected areas provide only partial protection, necessitating additional management measures.

While at the Center, multiple respirometry trials were performed utilizing an intermittent-closed system respirometer to measure oxygen consumption. The average routine metabolic rates for each individual were calculated at 17.8 +/- 1.3 mgO(2)kg(-1) h(-1), 20.5 +/- 1.6 mgO(2)kg(-1) h(-1), and 4.0 +/- NA mgO(2)kg(-1) h(-1), respectively, while the resting metabolic rate of SP1908 was calculated at 14.3 +/- 2.4 mgO(2)kg(-1) h(-1). Oxygen consumption rates were measured between 6.0 and 8.8 degrees C. Both the active and resting metabolic rates for the Pacific sleeper shark were like those of the previously measured and closely related Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) and the temperate zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum) when scaled to the temperature in this study.

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,Comparative demography of three black seabreams found in the Ryukyu Archipelago: implication for the definition of protandrous hermaphrodites,"Life history traits of three commercial and recreational important black seabreams were characterized from the Ryukyu Archipelago of the Northwest Pacific. The active spawning periods were similar among three species and were determined to be between January and March, coinciding with a lower water temperature. The Okinawan yellow-fin seabream Acanthopagrus chinshira is a large-bodied species which exhibits a moderate initial growth, late female maturation, and an estimated intermediate lifespan of 15 years. The Pacific seabream Acanthopagrus pacificus is a medium-bodied species with a slow initial growth and an estimated intermediate lifespan of 20 years.

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,Fish assemblage distribution along free-flowing rivers entering a reservoir cascade,"Reservoir cascades have cumulative effects on fish assemblages that can be less pronounced with the presence of incoming free-flowing tributaries. However, it is still poorly understood how the effects of cascade reservoirs on fish communities are driven. This study aimed to assess the fish assemblage distribution along two long free-flowing rivers that enter the first two reservoirs in cascade within the upper Grande River basin. Fishes were collected bi-monthly throughout 1 year along this cascade and were evaluated by composition and richness of native and non-native species. The transitional areas between the rivers and the first reservoir presented the highest richness. An increase of non-native species was observed from the uppermost (Rivers) to the downmost (lower reservoir) region. Although the seasonality did not influence fish composition in the Camargos-Itutinga cascade system, discharge-related variables (water level, transparency, and temperature), together with the position along the gradient, were the main drivers of the variation on fish assemblage's structure. The results reinforce the role of cascade systems in the increase of non-native species, as well as the importance of free-flowing rivers in structuring the fish fauna in such conditions.",Freshwater fish; Rio Grande basin; Impoundments; Neotropical region; Tributaries,2022,105,11,10.1007/s10641-022-01345-2,0378-1909,10,83,186,1281,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Determining sex in golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) nestlings,"Incorporating sex ratios of nestlings into population viability studies increases knowledge of overall health of endangered populations. Currently, a reliable non-invasive method to identify the sex of golden eagle nestlings is not available; however, claims are commonly made based on morphology. Ten biometric measurements from 43 Scottish golden eagles aged 2-7.5 weeks were assessed to see if sex could actually be determined using this non-invasive methodology. Sex was confirmed via molecular analysis of blood samples. Discrete and principal component analyses of the different biometrics could not correctly determine individual nestling sex. Therefore, despite being more invasive, molecular sexing remains the recommended tool of choice for accurate sex identification of Scottish golden eagle nestlings younger than 7.5 weeks of age. This has important implications for golden eagle field studies where empirical morphological measurements are frequently and typically taken, but we have shown are not reliable in determining the sex of such young nestlings.",Biometric; Sexing; Golden eagle; Non-invasive; Nestling,2023,69,1,10.1007/s10344-022-01627-1,1612-4642,8,61,152,1069,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"Apparent survival, reproduction, and population growth estimation of a Kentish plover population in the Canary Islands","The increase of the tourism and urbanization of vast areas of dunes and beaches has been accompanied by an increase in the level of disturbances to many shorebirds, especially on those species which depend on such habitats to breed. The European Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) population is declining, also in the Canarian archipelago, one of the most important touristic destinations worldwide. Using data from an intense monitoring program on Lanzarote Island and the nearby La Graciosa islet (hereafter, both referred as Lanzarote), we aimed to (1) estimate the breeding output and survival and (2) use these parameter estimates to build a population model to assess the long-term growth rate of the population and evaluate, accordingly, its conservation status. Our studied population presents a relatively high breeding success although, thereafter, the first-year apparent survival is low. Even though adult apparent survival rates are reasonably high, these seem insufficient to compensate for the low survival rates of the first-year birds. In this sense, we found a negative growth rate according to a population model estimating an annual loss equivalent to 20\% (95\% confidence interval: 6-35\%). Local studies to account for the effects of human disturbance caused by tourist industry on survival, breeding rates, and demography are required to develop precise conservation actions for the Kentish plover population in Lanzarote.",Biological conservation; Charadrius alexandrinus; Demography; Macaronesia; Shorebirds; Tourism; Waders,2022,68,4,10.1007/s10344-022-01601-x,1612-4642,16,118,217,1452,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

The case was detected during routine screening. Post-mortem and laboratory examination suggested virus-induced interstitial pneumonia. Viral genome could be detected in various organs including brain, lung, spleen, and lymph nodes by real-time PCR. Whole-genome sequence analysis confirmed infection of Pango lineage B.1.617.2 of SARS-CoV-2. Till now, only Asiatic lions have been reported to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in India. Infections in animals were detected during peak phase of pandemic and all the cases were captive with close contacts with humans, whereas the present case was observed when human cases were significantly low. No tangible evidence linked to widespread infection in the wild population and the incidence seems to be isolated case.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Distance to landfill and habitat cover predict colony size in a Western Mediterranean white stork population,"Artificial food subsidies like landfills generate very strong impacts on animal ecology and spatial behavior. Landfills indeed have been considered to be one of the most influential factors explaining the very fast recovery of many colonial waterbird populations worldwide, as documented for the white stork Ciconia ciconia. More recently, the increase of rice fields in some regions have also been argued to be part of an influencial process underlying the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of this species over many areas in southern Europe. It remains unknown whether these two habitat factors play an important role at explaining the spatial distribution pattern of the white stork and, more particularly, whether colony funding or colony size is dependent on them. Using data from a census conducted in 2018, we aimed to assess the effect of distance to a landfill or to rice fields, among other habitat factors, on the breeding colony size of a white stork population in northern Spain. Larger colonies were more likely to appear in trees or cliff, but less likely in buildings or other artificial substrates. They were also significantly more likely with decreasing distance to landfill, and when the habitat was dominated by dry cropland and meadows close to water bodies. Rice fields did not seem to have any significant effect. Our findings fit with those from other regions in Europe, and highlight the effect landfills have on population dynamics and spatial ecology for those species which are able to feed on this type of food subsidy. Our results also show that the main habitat cover over large geographic scales still plays a role independently of landfills. The European agricultural policies associated with the type and management of crops, and the Common Agricultural Policy in particular, will still have a decisive role for the species.",Biogeography; Landscape management; Mediterranean agricultural mosaic; Waterbirds,2022,68,6,10.1007/s10344-022-01626-2,1612-4642,16,108,297,1863,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Do porcupines self-medicate? The seasonal consumption of plants with antiparasitic properties coincides with that of parasite infections in Hystrix cristata of Central Italy,"Dietary selection is an important process for the maintenance of health homeostasis. From the potential food items available in one's environment, choices must be made to assure a proper balance of nutrients for energy, growth, maintenance, and reproduction. Sometimes, animals select plants also for their medicinal properties. This behaviour constitutes what is called the medicinal diet, and it consists of items with beneficial bioactive properties. In primates and other species investigated so far, it has been found that 15-25\% of the plant items consumed have antiparasitic properties. We investigated the dietary habits of three non-overlapping populations of crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata) in Central Italy and identified medicinal food species, their potential antiparasitic benefits, and the seasonality of parasite infections in relation to their ingestion. The three study areas were characterised by contrasting degrees of ``natural{''} and agricultural landscapes. In total, 44 food items were recorded from 43 plant species based on macro- and microscopic faecal analyses (N = 22, 24 spp., respectively) or stomach contents from necropsied roadkill specimens (N = 11 spp.). The dietary variation between groups could be attributed to differences in human land use patterns, affecting the relative accessibility to cultivars and wild growing plants. The relative proportion of plants in the diet with antiparasitic properties varied between study areas 1, 2, and 3, accounting for 72\%, 48\%, and 27\%, respectively. Porcupines were found to be infected by 7 species of ectoparasites (ticks and fleas) and 7 species of endoparasites (strongyle nematode, protozoa, and bacteria) in the cold and rainy months. The consumption of medicinal foods in all three groups coincided with the highest detected prevalence of I. ricinus, P. irritans, P. melis, G. duodenalis, and A. italicus in autumn and winter. This study adds to our general understanding of factors influencing dietary selection and presents the first evidence for a link between medicinal food consumption and parasite infection seasonality in crested porcupines of Europe. Future research is required to ascertain the impact of these parasites on infected hosts, potential modes of action of these medicinal foods on them and the gut microbiota, and host health and nutritional status.",Dietary selection; Self-medication; Antiparasitic properties; Ectoparasites; Endoparasites,2022,68,6,10.1007/s10344-022-01620-8,1612-4642,23,173,352,2368,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Do telemetry harnesses affect giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) behavior and welfare?,"Telemetry provides researchers with invaluable data and has contributed to the progress of animal ecology and behavioral studies. However, the impact of biotelemetry devices on animal behavior and welfare has been evaluated in a few species. The telemetry device (GPS or VHF) is attached to a harness made especially for giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) due to its particular anatomy, and this is the best way to access the scheduled spatiotemporal data of the species' movement. We evaluated the adverse effects of biotelemetry devices on giant anteaters' behavior and welfare. Behavioral analysis on giant anteaters in captivity (n = 3) was conducted by observing them with and without the GPS-harness. We also include data on GPS-harness dysfunction and animal injuries observed from free-ranging tagged animals (n=74). The GPS-harness influenced the behavior distributions frequency, but no new or atypical act was verified. Free-ranging individuals detached the harness twice, five removed the front part of the harness, and three had skin injuries . This is the first study to document telemetry device effects on giant anteaters. To date, severe adverse effects of harness-attached GPS tracking devices were not reported for this species. Our data supports the continued use of this method for monitoring free-ranging or captive giant anteaters. However, we recommend and stress the importance of continued research that helps improve telemetry and monitoring techniques.",Animal behavior; Ethogram; GPS-harness; Pilosa; Physical health,2022,68,3,10.1007/s10344-022-01587-6,1612-4642,11,92,222,1487,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"Eurasian otter Lutra lutra diet mirrors the decline of native fish assemblages in a semi-arid catchment (River Segura, SE Spain)","In semi-arid environments, the effects of irregularly distributed rainfall, flow regulation and water inter-basin transfer enhance the spread of non-native fish to the detriment of native communities. In the River Segura, since the 1980s the number of non-native fish species has progressively increased, also because of the building of water transfer facility connecting the rivers Segura and Tajo. With the aim of highlighting how man-driven changes in the diversity of fish communities affect the diet of top-predators, we compared Eurasian otter Lutra lutra diet in the span of 20 years, i.e. 1997-98 vs. 2016-19. As habitat quality affects the condition of Andalusian barbel Luciobarbus sclateri, the most widespread native fish, we also compared the size of preyed barbels to point out whether human activities may have lowered their profitability to otters. Fish and introduced red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii formed the bulk of otter diet in both study periods. In 2016-19 the contribution of non-native species to otter diet increased significantly, both for crayfish and fish, which included ten non-native species. Otter feeding habits faithfully mirrored the variation in the composition of the fish community and confirmed the importance of crayfish as alternative-to-fish prey in the Iberian Peninsula. The average length of preyed barbels was significantly lower in the second study period, consistently with a decline in barbel profitability for otters.",Environmental stress; Non-native fish; Procambarus clarkii; Inter-basin water transfer; Invasive species,2022,68,3,10.1007/s10344-022-01588-5,1612-4642,20,128,221,1476,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Due to its status as an introduced species and an important game animal within Victoria, management of the species is complex. Given this complexity, genetic studies can provide important information regarding population structure and diversity which can assist in controlling problematic populations of hog deer, while also ensuring viable game stock in sites managed as game reserves. The aim of this study was to investigate the population genetic structure and diversity of the Victorian hog deer 150 years after introduction using short tandem repeats (STRs). Hog deer samples were collected across 15 sites of differing management regimes in the Gippsland region of Victoria and genotyped for 13 polymorphic STR loci. Up to four distinct genetic clusters were identified across the sites sampled, suggesting that despite low observed genetic diversity, population structure is present across their range. It was also possible to detect evidence of recent translocations among populations. This study suggests that the presence of distinct genetic clusters may enable management of separate genetic units, considering invasive species and game management objectives.",Axis porcinus; Introduced species; Game management; Translocations; Genetic structure,2022,68,4,10.1007/s10344-022-01592-9,1612-4642,19,129,191,1287,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

We analysed 303 red deer individuals from the middle of the region, in seven Hungarian game reserves, at ten microsatellite loci (C01, C229, T26, T108, T123, T156, T172, T193, T501, T507), to investigate the genetic diversity of these subpopulations. We discovered high levels of genetic diversity of red deer subpopulations; allelic richness values ranging 4.99-7.01, observed heterozygosity 0.729-0.800, polymorphic information content 0.722-0.806, and Shannon's information index 1.668-2.064. Multi-locus analyses indicated population admixtures of various degrees that corresponded to geographical location, and complex genetic structures were shown by clustering. Populations in the south-western and the north-eastern parts of the region formed two highly separated groups, and the red deer from populations in between them were highly admixed (in western Pannonia/Transdanubia, where the Danube flows into the Carpathian Basin). This pattern corresponds to the distribution of mitochondrial as well as Y-chromosome lineages. Assignment tests showed that a large fraction of individuals (29.4\%) are found outside of their population of origin, indicating that the dispersal of red deer is rather common, which could be expected considering the life course of the species.",Cervus elaphus; Red deer; Genetic structure; Microsatellites; Population genetics,2022,68,5,10.1007/s10344-022-01602-w,1612-4642,16,108,214,1510,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Herbivore damage to sunflowers (Helianthus annuus L.) in the Czech Republic,"The numbers of large wild herbivores are rising in the Czech Republic, leading to increased grazing pressure on agricultural crops, including the sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), which is highly sensitive to grazing. In this study, we aim to estimate the amount of damage to sunflower crops in the Czech Republic, experimentally evaluate the effects of grazing on sunflower development and yield and their response to given types of damage, and propose a procedure for quantifying damage caused to sunflower crops. Our results indicate that most sunflowers damaged below the cotyledon at any stage of growth died or failed to yield achenes, while those damaged above the cotyledon were better able to regenerate and produce some form of harvest. In most cases, plants damaged at 11 cm height (growth stage BBCH 10-12) were able to increase growth intensity, replace damaged tissue and make up for any loss. In later growth stages, this ability progressively decreased. Plants damaged at 15 cm (BBCH 14-16), for example, produced just 14\% of achievable production. On the other hand, we observed a 10\% yield increase in undamaged plants when competitive neighbours were removed. Overall, we estimate total damage to sunflower achene production caused by herbivores in the Czech Republic at 16\%.",Agriculture-wildlife conflict; Crop damage; Loss of production; Ungulates; Wild animals,2022,68,3,10.1007/s10344-022-01589-4,1612-4642,11,75,205,1297,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Beaver activity affects not only aquatic ecosystems but also terrestrial habitats and organisms. In recent times, beaver populations have been detected in Central Italy. In this work, we determined the use of beaver lodges and dams by native animal species in Central Italy through intensive camera trapping between March 2021 and May 2022. Saproxylic beetles were searched by sight in spring and summer on lodges, dams, and gnawed trunks on river shorelines. We collected 132 records belonging to at least 17 species on beaver dams and lodges, several of them of conservation concern (e.g. the European bittern Botaurus stellaris and the endemic water vole Arvicola italicus). The most detected species within beaver structure was the yellow-necked field mouse Apodemus flavicollis, with 67 independent videos. Despite being confirmed as a nocturnal species, in our study area, A. flavicollis showed an activity peak on bright moonlight nights. The lodge may thus be used as a protection site from predation risk for small rodents, which may benefit from the beaver presence. By building dams and lodges, Eurasian beavers can increase habitat heterogeneity, thus promoting biodiversity increase and improvement.

These cases extend the published dates on copulations in Europe and the length of the mating season. These couples showed the same behaviour as those recorded in spring. Two females interacted with three different males, but we only saw them copulating with one male. Three of the four courtship cases occurred around a concentrated and seasonal source of food that congregated a large number of bears in restricted areas for a few weeks.

EVODEVO,A CYC-RAD-DIV-DRIF interaction likely pre-dates the origin of floral monosymmetry in Lamiales,"Background An outstanding question in evolutionary biology is how genetic interactions defining novel traits evolve. They may evolve either by de novo assembly of previously non-interacting genes or by en bloc co-option of interactions from other functions. We tested these hypotheses in the context of a novel phenotype-Lamiales flower monosymmetry-defined by a developmental program that relies on regulatory interaction among CYCLOIDEA, RADIALIS, DIVARICATA, and DRIF gene products. In Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon), representing Lamiales, we tested whether components of this program likely function beyond their previously known role in petal and stamen development. In Solanum lycopersicum (tomato), representing Solanales which diverged from Lamiales before the origin of Lamiales floral monosymmetry, we additionally tested for regulatory interactions in this program. Results We found that RADIALIS, DIVARICATA, and DRIF are expressed in snapdragon ovaries and developing fruit, similar to their homologs during tomato fruit development. In addition, we found that a tomato CYCLOIDEA ortholog positively regulates a tomato RADIALIS ortholog. Conclusion Our results provide preliminary support to the hypothesis that the developmental program defining floral monosymmetry in Lamiales was co-opted en bloc from a function in carpel development. This expands our understanding of novel trait evolution facilitated by co-option of existing regulatory interactions.",CYCLOIDEA; Floral monosymmetry; Genetic program; Lamiales; RADIALIS; Solanales,2022,13,1,10.1186/s13227-021-00187-w,NA,12,93,200,1470,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
EVODEVO,Brachiopod and mollusc biomineralisation is a conserved process that was lost in the phoronid-bryozoan stem lineage,"Background Brachiopods and molluscs are lophotrochozoans with hard external shells which are often believed to have evolved convergently. While palaeontological data indicate that both groups are descended from biomineralising Cambrian ancestors, the closest relatives of brachiopods, phoronids and bryozoans, are mineralised to a much lower extent and are comparatively poorly represented in the Palaeozoic fossil record. Although brachiopod and mollusc shells are structurally analogous, genomic and proteomic evidence indicates that their formation involves a complement of conserved, orthologous genes. Here, we study a set of genes comprised of 3 homeodomain transcription factors, one signalling molecule and 6 structural proteins which are implicated in mollusc and brachiopod shell formation, search for their orthologs in transcriptomes or genomes of brachiopods, phoronids and bryozoans, and present expression patterns of 8 of the genes in postmetamorphic juveniles of the rhynchonelliform brachiopod T. transversa. Results Transcriptome and genome searches for the 10 target genes in the brachiopods Terebratalia transversa, Lingula anatina, Novocrania anomala, the bryozoans Bugula neritina and Membranipora membranacea, and the phoronids Phoronis australis and Phoronopsis harmeri resulted in the recovery of orthologs of the majority of the genes in all taxa. While the full complement of genes was present in all brachiopods with a single exception in L. anatina, a bloc of four genes could consistently not be retrieved from bryozoans and phoronids. The genes engrailed, distal-less, ferritin, perlucin, sp1 and sp2 were shown to be expressed in the biomineralising mantle margin of T. transversa juveniles. Conclusions The gene expression patterns we recovered indicate that while mineralised shells in brachiopods and molluscs are structurally analogous, their formation builds on a homologous process that involves a conserved complement of orthologous genes. Losses of some of the genes related to biomineralisation in bryozoans and phoronids indicate that loss of the capacity to form mineralised structures occurred already in the phoronid-bryozoan stem group and supports the idea that mineralised skeletons evolved secondarily in some of the bryozoan subclades.",NA,2022,13,1,10.1186/s13227-022-00202-8,NA,16,115,322,2286,NA,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
EVODEVO,"Delayed differentiation of epidermal cells walls can underlie pedomorphosis in plants: the case of pedomorphic petals in the hummingbird-pollinated Caiophora hibiscifolia (Loasaceae, subfam. Loasoideae) species","Background Understanding the relationship between macroevolutionary diversity and variation in organism development is an important goal of evolutionary biology. Variation in the morphology of several plant and animal lineages is attributed to pedomorphosis, a case of heterochrony, where an ancestral juvenile shape is retained in an adult descendant. Pedomorphosis facilitated morphological adaptation in different plant lineages, but its cellular and molecular basis needs further exploration. Plant development differs from animal development in that cells are enclosed by cell walls and do not migrate. Moreover, in many plant lineages, the differentiated epidermis of leaves, and leaf-derived structures, such as petals, limits organ growth. We, therefore, proposed that pedomorphosis in leaves, and in leaf-derived structures, results from delayed differentiation of epidermal cells with respect to reproductive maturity. This idea was explored for petal evolution, given the importance of corolla morphology for angiosperm reproductive success. Results By comparing cell morphology and transcriptional profiles between 5 mm flower buds and mature flowers of an entomophile and an ornitophile Loasoideae species (a lineage that experienced transitions from bee- to hummingbird-pollination), we show that evolution of pedomorphic petals of the ornithophile species likely involved delayed differentiation of epidermal cells with respect to flower maturity. We also found that developmental mechanisms other than pedomorphosis might have contributed to evolution of corolla morphology. Conclusions Our results highlight a need for considering alternatives to the flower-centric perspective when studying the origin of variation in flower morphology, as this can be generated by developmental processes that are also shared with leaves.",Heterochrony; Pedomorphosis; Cell shape; Epidermis differentiation; Flower evolution; Petal; Transcriptome; Loasoideae; Pollination,2022,13,1,10.1186/s13227-021-00186-x,NA,25,210,251,1840,9,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
EVODEVO,Distal-less and spalt are distal organisers of pierid wing patterns,"Two genes, Distal-less (Dll) and spalt (sal), are known to be involved in establishing nymphalid butterfly wing patterns. They function in several ways: in the differentiation of the eyespot's central signalling cells, or foci; in the differentiation of the surrounding black disc; in overall scale melanisation (Dll); and in elaborating marginal patterns, such as parafocal elements. However, little is known about the functions of these genes in the development of wing patterns in other butterfly families. Here, we study the expression and function of Dll and sal in the development of spots and other melanic wing patterns of the Indian cabbage white, Pieris canidia, a pierid butterfly. In P. canidia, both Dll and Sal proteins are expressed in the scale-building cells at the wing tips, in chevron patterns along the pupal wing margins, and in areas of future scale melanisation. Additionally, Sal alone is expressed in the future black spots. CRISPR knockouts of Dll and sal showed that each gene is required for the development of melanic wing pattern elements, and repressing pteridine granule formation, in the areas where they are expressed. We conclude that both genes likely play ancestral roles in organising distal butterfly wing patterns, across pierid and nymphalid butterflies, but are unlikely to be differentiating signalling centres in pierids black spots.

EVODEVO,Evolution and expression of LEAFY genes in ferns and lycophytes,"Background The LEAFY (LFY) transcription factors are present in algae and across land plants. The available expression and functional data of these genes in embryophytes suggest that LFY genes control a plethora of processes including the first zygotic cell division in bryophytes, shoot cell divisions of the gametophyte and sporophyte in ferns, cone differentiation in gymnosperms and floral meristem identity in flowering plants. However, their putative plesiomorphic role in plant reproductive transition in vascular plants remains untested. Results We perform Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses for the LFY gene lineage in embryophytes with expanded sampling in lycophytes and ferns. We recover the previously identified seed plant duplication that results in LEAFY and NEEDLY paralogs. In addition, we recover multiple species-specific duplications in ferns and lycophytes and large-scale duplications possibly correlated with the occurrence of whole genome duplication (WGD) events in Equisetales and Salviniales. To test putative roles in diverse ferns and lycophytes we perform LFY expression analyses in Adiantum raddianum, Equisetum giganteum and Selaginella moellendorffii. Our results show that LFY genes are active in vegetative and reproductive tissues, with higher expression in early fertile developmental stages and during sporangia differentiation. Conclusions Our data point to previously unrecognized roles of LFY genes in sporangia differentiation in lycophytes and ferns and suggests that functions linked to reproductive structure development are not exclusive to seed plant LFY homologs.",LEAFY; Ferns; Lycophytes; Reproductive transition; Sporogenesis,2022,13,1,10.1186/s13227-021-00188-9,NA,10,63,225,1623,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
EVODEVO,Fleshy or dry: transcriptome analyses reveal the genetic mechanisms underlying bract development in Ephedra,"Background Gnetales have a key phylogenetic position in the evolution of seed plants. Among the Gnetales, there is an extraordinary morphological diversity of seeds, the genus Ephedra, in particular, exhibits fleshy, coriaceous or winged (dry) seeds. Despite this striking diversity, its underlying genetic mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the limited studies in gymnosperms. Expanding the genomic and developmental data from gymnosperms contributes to a better understanding of seed evolution and development. Results We performed transcriptome analyses on different plant tissues of two Ephedra species with different seed morphologies. Anatomical observations in early developing ovules, show that differences in the seed morphologies are established early in their development. The transcriptomic analyses in dry-seeded Ephedra californica and fleshy-seeded Ephedra antisyphilitica, allowed us to identify the major differences between the differentially expressed genes in these species. We detected several genes known to be involved in fruit ripening as upregulated in the fleshy seed of Ephedra antisyphilitica. Conclusions This study allowed us to determine the differentially expressed genes involved in seed development of two Ephedra species. Furthermore, the results of this study of seeds with the enigmatic morphology in Ephedra californica and Ephedra antisyphilitica, allowed us to corroborate the hypothesis which suggest that the extra envelopes covering the seeds of Gnetales are not genetically similar to integument.

EVODEVO,Linking the evolution of development of stem vascular system in Nyctaginaceae and its correlation to habit and species diversification,"Background Alternative patterns of secondary growth in stems of Nyctaginaceae is present in all growth habits of the family and have been known for a long time. However, the interpretation of types of cambial variants have been controversial, given that different authors have given them different developmental interpretations. The different growth habits coupled with an enormous stem anatomical diversity offers the unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of complex developments, to address how these anatomies shifted within habits, and how the acquisition of novel cambial variants and habit transitions impacted the diversification of the family. Methods We integrated developmental data with a phylogenetic framework to investigate the diversity and evolution of stem anatomy in Nyctaginaceae using phylogenetic comparative methods, reconstructing ancestral states, and examining whether anatomical shifts correspond to species diversification rate shifts in the family. Results Two types of cambial variants, interxylary phloem and successive cambia, were recorded in Nyctaginaceae, which result from four different ontogenies. These ontogenetic trajectories depart from two distinct primary vascular structures (regular or polycyclic eustele) yet, they contain shared developmental stages which generate stem morphologies with deconstructed boundaries of morphological categories (continuum morphology). Unlike our a priori hypotheses, interxylary phloem is reconstructed as the ancestral character for the family, with three ontogenies characterized as successive cambia evolving in few taxa. Cambial variants are not contingent on habits, and their transitions are independent from species diversification. Conclusions Our findings suggest that multiple developmental mechanisms, such as heterochrony and heterotopy, generate the transitions between interxylary phloem and successive cambia. Intermediate between these two extremes are present in Nyctaginaceae, suggesting a continuum morphology across the family as a generator of anatomical diversity.",Anatomy; BAMM; Caryophyllales; Continuum morphology; Developmental processes; Evolution; Ontogeny; Vascular tissues,2022,13,1,10.1186/s13227-021-00190-1,NA,19,134,275,2073,8,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
EVODEVO,"Phloem wedges in Malpighiaceae: origin, structure, diversification, and systematic relevance","Background Phloem wedges furrowing the wood are one of the most notorious, widespread types of cambial variants in Angiosperms. Many lianas in Malpighiaceae show these variations in the arrangement of the secondary tissues. Here we explore their ontogeny, structure, and evolution in Malpighiaceae, where phloem wedges appeared multiple times, showing how they have contributed to the anatomical diversification of the family. Using a broad sampling with 143 species from 50 genera, covering all major lineages in Malpighiaceae, we crossed data from ontogeny, stem anatomy, and phylogenetic comparative methods to determine ontogenetic trajectories, final anatomical architectures, and evolution within the most recent phylogeny for the family. Results Phloem wedges appeared exclusively in lianas and disappeared in shrub lineages nested within liana lineages. At the onset of development, the vascular cambium is regular, producing secondary tissues homogeneously across its girth, but soon, portions of the cambium in between the leaf insertions switch their activity producing less wood and more phloem, initially generating phloem arcs, which progress into phloem wedges. In the formation of these wedges, two ontogenetic trajectories were found, one that maintains the continuity of the cambium, and another where the cambium gets dissected. Phloem wedges frequently remain as the main cambial variant in several lineages, while in others there are additional steps toward more complex cambial variants, such as fissured stems, or included phloem wedges, the latter a novel type of interxylary phloem first described for the family. Conclusions Phloem wedges evolved exclusively in lianas, with two different ontogenies explaining the 10 independent origins of phloem wedges in Malpighiaceae. The presence of phloem wedges has favored the evolution of even more complex cambial variants such as fissured stems and interxylary phloem.",Cambial variant; Discontinuous cambium; Lianas; Limiting rays; Malpighiaceae; Phloem; Phloem wedges; Vascular cambium; Xylem,2022,13,1,10.1186/s13227-022-00196-3,NA,10,92,281,1939,9,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
EVODEVO,A chelicerate Wnt gene expression atlas: novel insights into the complexity of arthropod Wnt-patterning,"The Wnt genes represent a large family of secreted glycoprotein ligands that date back to early animal evolution. Multiple duplication events generated a set of 13 Wnt families of which 12 are preserved in protostomes. Embryonic Wnt expression patterns (Wnt-patterning) are complex, representing the plentitude of functions these genes play during development. Here, we comprehensively investigated the embryonic expression patterns of Wnt genes from three species of spiders covering both main groups of true spiders, Haplogynae and Entelegynae, a mygalomorph species (tarantula), as well as a distantly related chelicerate outgroup species, the harvestman Phalangium opilio. All spiders possess the same ten classes of Wnt genes, but retained partially different sets of duplicated Wnt genes after whole genome duplication, some of which representing impressive examples of sub- and neo-functionalization. The harvestman, however, possesses a more complete set of 11 Wnt genes but with no duplicates. Our comprehensive data-analysis suggests a high degree of complexity and evolutionary flexibility of Wnt-patterning likely providing a firm network of mutational protection. We discuss the new data on Wnt gene expression in terms of their potential function in segmentation, posterior elongation, and appendage development and critically review previous research on these topics. We conclude that earlier research may have suffered from the absence of comprehensive gene expression data leading to partial misconceptions about the roles of Wnt genes in development and evolution.",Wnt; Mygalomorpha; Opiliones; Spiders; Appendage development; Arthropod evolution; Gene duplication,2021,12,1,10.1186/s13227-021-00182-1,NA,14,103,226,1582,7,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
EVODEVO,Cell-specific expression and individual function of prohormone convertase PC1/3 in Tribolium larval growth highlights major evolutionary changes between beetle and fly neuroendocrine systems,"Background The insect neuroendocrine system acts in the regulation of physiology, development and growth. Molecular evolution of this system hence has the potential to allow for major biological differences between insect groups. Two prohormone convertases, PC1/3 and PC2, are found in animals and both function in the processing of neuropeptide precursors in the vertebrate neurosecretory pathway. Whereas PC2-function is conserved between the fly Drosophila and vertebrates, ancestral PC1/3 was lost in the fly lineage and has not been functionally studied in any protostome. Results In order to understand its original functions and the changes accompanying the gene loss in the fly, we investigated PC1/3 and PC2 expression and function in the beetle Tribolium castaneum. We found that PC2 is broadly expressed in the nervous system, whereas surprisingly, PC1/3 expression is restricted to specific cell groups in the posterior brain and suboesophageal ganglion. Both proteases have parallel but non-redundant functions in adult beetles' viability and fertility. Female infertility following RNAi is caused by a failure to deposit sufficient yolk to the developing oocytes. Larval RNAi against PC2 produced moulting defects where the larvae were not able to shed their old cuticle. This ecdysis phenotype was also observed in a small subset of PC1/3 knockdown larvae and was strongest in a double knockdown. Unexpectedly, most PC1/3-RNAi larvae showed strongly reduced growth, but went through larval moults despite minimal to zero weight gain. Conclusions The cell type-specific expression of PC1/3 and its essential requirement for larval growth highlight the important role of this gene within the insect neuroendocrine system. Genomic conservation in most insect groups suggests that it has a comparable individual function in other insects as well, which has been replaced by alternative mechanisms in flies.",Tribolium castaneum; Insect evolution; Prohormone convertases; PC1; 3; PC2; amontillado; Larval development; Neuroendocrine system,2021,12,1,10.1186/s13227-021-00179-w,NA,23,190,284,1917,9,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
EVODEVO,Distinct tooth regeneration systems deploy a conserved battery of genes,"Background: Vertebrate teeth exhibit a wide range of regenerative systems. Many species, including most mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, form replacement teeth at a histologically distinct location called the successional dental lamina, while other species do not employ such a system. Notably, a lamina-less'tooth replacement condition is found in a paraphyletic array of ray-finned fishes, such as stickleback, trout, cod, medaka, and bichir. Furthermore, the position, renewal potential, and latency times appear to vary drastically across different vertebrate tooth regeneration systems. The progenitor cells underlying tooth regeneration thus present highly divergent arrangements and potentials. Given the spectrum of regeneration systems present in vertebrates, it is unclear if morphologically divergent tooth regeneration systems deploy an overlapping battery of genes in their naive dental tissues. Results: In the present work, we aimed to determine whether or not tooth progenitor epithelia could be composed of a conserved cell type between vertebrate dentitions with divergent regeneration systems. To address this question, we compared the pharyngeal tooth regeneration processes in two ray-finned fishes: zebrafish (Danio rerio) and three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). These two teleost species diverged approximately 250 million years ago and demonstrate some stark differences in dental morphology and regeneration. Here, we find that the naive successional dental lamina in zebrafish expresses a battery of nine genes (bmpr1aa, bmp6, cd34, gli1, igfbp5a, Igr4, Igr6, nfatc1, and pitx2), while active Wnt signaling and Lef1 expression occur during early morphogenesis stages of tooth development. We also find that, despite the absence of a histologically distinct successional dental lamina in stickleback tooth fields, the same battery of nine genes (Bmpr1a, Bmp6, CD34, Gli1, igfbp5a, Lgr4, Lgr6, Nfatc1 , and Pitx2) are expressed in the basalmost endodermal cell layer, which is the region most closely associated with replacement tooth germs. Like zebrafish, stickleback replacement tooth germs additionally express Lef1 and exhibit active Wnt signaling. Thus, two fish systems that either have an organized successional dental lamina (zebrafish) or lack a morphologically distinct successional dental lamina (sticklebacks) deploy similar genetic programs during tooth regeneration. Conclusions: We propose that the expression domains described here delineate a highly conserved ``successional dental epithelium{''} (SDE). Furthermore, a set of orthologous genes is known to mark hair follicle epithelial stem cells in mice, suggesting that regenerative systems in other epithelial appendages may utilize a related epithelial progenitor cell type, despite the highly derived nature of the resulting functional organs.",Successional dental lamina; Tooth regeneration; Odontode; Epithelial appendage,2021,12,1,10.1186/s13227-021-00172-3,NA,10,71,394,2856,4,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,yes,no,yes
EVODEVO,Duplication of spiralian-specific TALE genes and evolution of the blastomere specification mechanism in the bivalve lineage,"Background Despite the conserved pattern of the cell-fate map among spiralians, bivalves display several modified characteristics during their early development, including early specification of the D blastomere by the cytoplasmic content, as well as the distinctive fate of the 2d blastomere. However, it is unclear what changes in gene regulatory mechanisms led to such changes in cell specification patterns. Spiralian-TALE (SPILE) genes are a group of spiralian-specific transcription factors that play a role in specifying blastomere cell fates during early development in limpets. We hypothesised that the expansion of SPILE gene repertoires influenced the evolution of the specification pattern of blastomere cell fates. Results We performed a transcriptome analysis of early development in the purplish bifurcate mussel and identified 13 SPILE genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the SPILE gene in molluscs suggested that duplications of SPILE genes occurred in the bivalve lineage. We examined the expression patterns of the SPILE gene in mussels and found that some SPILE genes were expressed in quartet-specific patterns, as observed in limpets. Furthermore, we found that several SPILE genes that had undergone gene duplication were specifically expressed in the D quadrant, C and D quadrants or the 2d blastomere. These expression patterns were distinct from the expression patterns of SPILE in their limpet counterparts. Conclusions These results suggest that, in addition to their ancestral role in quartet specification, certain SPILE genes in mussels contribute to the specification of the C and D quadrants. We suggest that the expansion of SPILE genes in the bivalve lineage contributed to the evolution of a unique cell fate specification pattern in bivalves.",Spiralian development; Gene duplication; Bivalve; Mollusca; TALE homeobox,2021,12,1,10.1186/s13227-021-00181-2,NA,16,123,263,1775,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION,Evidence that genomic incompatibilities and other multilocus processes impact hybrid fitness in a rattlesnake hybrid zone,"Hybrid zones provide valuable opportunities to understand the genomic mechanisms that promote speciation by providing insight into factors involved in intermediate stages of speciation. Here, we investigate introgression in a hybrid zone between two rattlesnake species (Crotalus viridis and Crotalus oreganus concolor) that have undergone historical allopatric divergence and recent range expansion and secondary contact. We use Bayesian genomic cline models to characterize genomic patterns of introgression between these lineages and identify loci potentially subject to selection in hybrids. We find evidence for a large number of genomic regions with biased ancestry that deviate from the genomic background in hybrids (i.e., excess ancestry loci), which tend to be associated with genomic regions with higher recombination rates. We also identify suites of excess ancestry loci that show highly correlated allele frequencies (including conspecific and heterospecific combinations) across physically unlinked genomic regions in hybrids. Our findings provide evidence for multiple multilocus evolutionary processes impacting hybrid fitness in this system.",Hybridization; linkage disequilibrium; population genomics; selection,2022,76,11,10.1111/evo.14612,0014-3820,16,121,157,1159,4,NA,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION,Public good-driven release of heterogeneous resources leads to genotypic diversification of an isogenic yeast population,"Understanding the basis of biological diversity remains a central problem in evolutionary biology. Using microbial systems, adaptive diversification has been studied in (a) spatially heterogeneous environments, (b) temporally segregated resources, and (c) resource specialization in a homogeneous environment. However, it is not well understood how adaptive diversification can take place in a homogeneous environment containing a single resource. Starting from an isogenic population of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we report rapid adaptive diversification, when propagated in an environment containing melibiose as the carbon source. The diversification is driven due to a public good enzyme alpha-galactosidase, which hydrolyzes melibiose into glucose and galactose. The diversification is driven by mutations at a single locus, in the GAL3 gene in the S. cerevisiae GAL/MEL regulon. We show that metabolic co-operation involving public resources could be an important mode of generating biological diversity. Our study demonstrates sympatric diversification of yeast starting from an isogenic population and provides detailed mechanistic insights into the factors and conditions responsible for generating and maintaining the population diversity.",Genetic divergence; melibiose; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sympatry,2022,76,12,10.1111/evo.14646,0014-3820,15,120,168,1254,4,NA,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION,Evolution in fluctuating environments: A generic modular approach,"Evolutionary processes take place in fluctuating environments, where carrying capacities and selective forces vary over time. The fate of a mutant type and the persistence time of polymorphic states were studied in some specific cases of varying environments, but a generic methodology is still lacking. Here, we present such a general analytic framework. We first identify a set of elementary building blocks, a few basic demographic processes like logistic or exponential growth, competition at equilibrium, sudden decline, and so on. For each of these elementary blocks, we evaluate the mean and the variance of the changes in the frequency of the mutant population. Finally, we show how to find the relevant terms of the diffusion equation for each arbitrary combination of these blocks. Armed with this technique one may calculate easily the quantities that govern the evolutionary dynamics, like the chance of ultimate fixation, the time to absorption, and the time to fixation.",Competition; chance of ultimate fixation; fitness; fluctuations; varying environment,2022,76,11,10.1111/evo.14616,0014-3820,8,65,153,984,5,NA,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION,Co-evolution of dormancy and dispersal in spatially autocorrelated landscapes,"The evolution of dispersal can be driven by spatial processes, such as landscape structure, and temporal processes, such as disturbance. Dormancy, or dispersal in time, is generally thought to evolve in response to temporal processes. In spite of broad empirical and theoretical evidence of trade-offs between dispersal and dormancy, we lack evidence that spatial structure can drive the evolution of dormancy. Here, we develop a simulation-based model of the joint evolution of dispersal and dormancy in spatially heterogeneous landscapes. We show that dormancy and dispersal are each favored under different landscape conditions, but not simultaneously under any of the conditions we tested. We further show that, when dispersal distances are short, dormancy can evolve directly in response to landscape structure. In this case, selection is primarily driven by benefits associated with avoiding kin competition. Our results are similar in both highly simplified and realistically complex landscapes.",Diapause; kin selection; movement; migration; quiescence; spatial clustering,2022,76,11,10.1111/evo.14625,0014-3820,9,77,146,1002,6,NA,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION,Evidence for an evo-devo-derived hypothesis on three-dimensional flower shape modularity in a tropical orchid clade,"Covarying suites of phenotypic traits, or modules, are increasingly recognized to promote morphological evolution. However, information on how modularity influences flower diversity is rare and lacking for Orchidaceae. Here, we combine high-resolution X-ray computed tomography scanning with three-dimensional geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods to test various hypotheses about three-dimensional patterns of flower evolutionary modularity in Malagasy Bulbophyllum orchids and examine rates and modes of module evolution. Based on the four evolutionary modules identified (i.e., sepals, lateral petals, labellum + column-foot, and column-part), our data support the hypothesis that both genetic-developmental and functional adaptive factors shaped evolutionary flower trait covariation in these tropical orchids. In line with ``evo-devo{''} studies, we also find that the labellum evolved independently from the rest of the petal whorl. Finally, we show that modules evolved with different rates, and either in a neutral fashion (only column-part) or under selective constraints, as likely imposed by pollinators. Overall, this study supports current views that modular units can enhance the range and rate of morphological evolution.",3D geometric morphometrics; Bulbophyllum; evo-devo; flower shape modularity; high-resolution X-ray computed tomography; Orchidaceae; phylogenetic comparative methods,2022,76,11,10.1111/evo.14621,0014-3820,15,115,168,1259,7,NA,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION,Why are animals conspicuously colored? Evolution of sexual versus warning signals in land vertebrates,"Conspicuous colors (e.g., red, yellow, blue) have evolved numerous times across animals. But the function of this coloration can differ radically among species. Many species use this coloration as a sexual signal to conspecifics, whereas others use it as a warning signal to predators. Why do different species evolve conspicuous coloration in association with one function as opposed to the other? We address this question in terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods) using phylogenetic approaches, and test whether day-night activities of species help determine these patterns. Using phylogenetic logistic regression, we found that conspicuous, sexually dimorphic coloration is significantly associated with diurnal lineages (e.g., many birds and lizards). By contrast, the evolution of warning signals was significantly associated with large-scale clades that were ancestrally nocturnal (e.g., snakes, amphibians), regardless of the current diel activity of species. Overall, we show that the evolution of conspicuous coloration as warning signals or sexual signals is influenced by the ecology of species, both recently and in the ancient past.",aposematism; color; diel activity; macroevolution; mimicry; sexual selection; vertebrates,2022,76,12,10.1111/evo.14636,0014-3820,14,101,162,1142,7,NA,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT,Effects of the egg incubation environment on turtle carapace development,"Developing organisms are often exposed to fluctuating environments that destabilize tissue-scale processes and induce abnormal phenotypes. This might be common in species that lay eggs in the external environment and with little parental care, such as many reptiles. In turtles, morphological development has provided striking examples of abnormal phenotypic patterns, though the influence of the environment remains unclear. To this end, we compared fluctuating asymmetry, as a proxy for developmental instability, in turtle hatchlings incubated in controlled laboratory and unstable natural conditions. Wild and laboratory hatchlings featured similar proportions of supernumerary scales (scutes) on the dorsal shell (carapace). Such abnormal scutes likely elevated shape asymmetry, which was highest in natural nests. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that hot and dry environments cause abnormal scute formation by subjecting eggs to a range of hydric and thermal laboratory incubation regimes. Shape asymmetry was similar in hatchlings incubated at five constant temperatures (26-30 degrees C). A hot (30 degrees C) and severely Dry substrate yielded smaller hatchlings but scutes were not overtly affected. Our study suggests that changing nest environments contribute to fluctuating asymmetry in egg-laying reptiles, while clarifying the conditions at which turtle shell development remains buffered from the external environment.",developmental instability; developmental noise; fluctuating asymmetry; turtle shell development,2023,25,2,10.1111/ede.12425,1520-541X,10,72,199,1437,4,NA,250,5,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes

Two three-celled specimens characterized by a pair of small cells overlying a large cell have been recovered from the Ediacaran Zhenba microfossil assemblage. Their cell adhesion pattern is highly comparable to a phenomenon reported from the Weng'an biota that was interpreted as fossil embryos undergoing discoidal cleavage. However, our specimens contain fewer cells and thus probably represent developmental precursors of the Weng'an counterparts. Additionally, new material shows several anatomical features that are inconsistent with an embryo interpretation, including (1) an unusually large volume of ``blastomeres,{''} (2) a putative nucleus preserved within the large ``yolk cell,{''} and (3) completely separated cells.

EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT,Breaking constraints: The development and evolution of extreme fin morphology in the Bramidae,"The developmental process establishes the foundation upon which natural selection may act. In that same sense, it is inundated with numerous constraints that work to limit the directions in which a phenotype may respond to selective pressures. Extreme phenotypes have been used in the past to identify tradeoffs and constraints and may aid in recognizing how alterations to the Bauplane can influence the trajectories of lineages. The Bramidae, a family of Scombriformes consisting of 20 extant species, are unique in that five species greatly deviate from the stout, ovaloid bodies that typify the bramids. The Ptericlinae, or fanfishes, are instead characterized by relatively elongated body plans and extreme modifications to their medial fins. Here, we explore the development of Bramidae morphologies and examine them through a phylogenetic lens to investigate the concepts of developmental and evolutionary constraints. Contrary to our predictions that the fanfishes had been constrained by inherited properties of an ancestral state, we find that the fanfishes exhibit both increased rates of trait evolution and differ substantially from the other bramids in their developmental trajectories. Conversely, the remaining bramid genera differ little, both among one another and in comparison, to the sister family Caristiidae. In all, our data suggest that the fanfishes have broken constraints, thereby allowing them to mitigate trade-offs on distinctive aspects of morphology.",Bramidae; comparative methods; geometric morphometrics; historical contingency; modularity,2022,24,3-Apr,10.1111/ede.12409,1520-541X,13,93,218,1483,5,NA,250,5,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT,Breaking the constraint on the number of cervical vertebrae in mammals: On homeotic transformations in lorises and pottos,"Mammals almost always have seven cervical vertebrae. The strong evolutionary constraint on changes in this number has been broken in sloths and manatees. We have proposed that the extremely low activity and metabolic rates of these species relax the stabilizing selection against changes in the cervical count. Our hypothesis is that strong stabilizing selection in other mammals is largely indirect and due to associated pleiotropic effects, including juvenile cancers. Additional direct selection can occur due to biomechanical problems (thoracic outlet syndrome). Low metabolic and activity rates are thought to diminish these direct and indirect effects. To test this hypothesis within the primates, we have compared the number of cervical vertebrae of three lorisid species with particularly low activity and metabolic rates with those of more active primate species, including with their phylogenetically closest active relatives, the galagids (bushbabies). In support of our hypothesis, we found that 37.6\% of the lorisid specimens had an abnormal cervical count, which is a higher percentage than in the other nine primate families, in which the incidence varied from zero to 2.2\%. We conclude that our data support the importance of internal selection in constraining evolvability and of a relaxed stabilizing selection for increasing evolvability. Additionally, we discuss that there is no support for a role of the muscularized diaphragm in the evolutionary constraint.",cervical ribs; evolutionary constraint; homeotic transformations; mammals; pleiotropic constraint; primates; rudimentary first ribs; stabilizing selection; transitional vertebrae,2022,24,6,10.1111/ede.12424,1520-541X,18,121,219,1482,9,NA,250,5,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT,Characterizing the genetic basis of trait evolution in the Mexican cavefish,"Evolution in response to a change in ecology often coincides with various morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. For most organisms little is known about the genetic and functional relationship between evolutionarily derived traits, representing a critical gap in our understanding of adaptation. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, consists of largely independent populations of fish that inhabit at least 30 caves in Northeast Mexico, and a surface fish population, that inhabit the rivers of Mexico and Southern Texas. The recent application of molecular genetic approaches combined with behavioral phenotyping have established A. mexicanus as a model for studying the evolution of complex traits. Cave populations of A. mexicanus are interfertile with surface populations and have evolved numerous traits including eye degeneration, insomnia, albinism, and enhanced mechanosensory function. The interfertility of different populations from the same species provides a unique opportunity to define the genetic relationship between evolved traits and assess the co-evolution of behavioral and morphological traits with one another. To define the relationships between morphological and behavioral traits, we developed a pipeline to test individual fish for multiple traits. This pipeline confirmed differences in locomotor activity, prey capture, and startle reflex between surface and cavefish populations. To measure the relationship between traits, individual F2 hybrid fish were characterized for locomotor behavior, prey-capture behavior, startle reflex, and morphological attributes. Analysis revealed an association between body length and slower escape reflex, suggesting a trade-off between increased size and predator avoidance in cavefish. Overall, there were few associations between individual behavioral traits, or behavioral and morphological traits, suggesting independent genetic changes underlie the evolution of the measured behavioral and morphological traits. Taken together, this approach provides a novel system to identify genetic underpinnings of naturally occurring variation in morphological and behavioral traits.",cavefish; development; behavior,2022,24,5,10.1111/ede.12412,1520-541X,11,75,289,2160,3,NA,250,5,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT,Comparative reconstruction of the predatory feeding structures of the polyphenic nematode Pristionchus pacificus,"Pristionchus pacificus is a nematode model for the developmental genetics of morphological polyphenism, especially at the level of individual cells. Morphological polyphenism in this species includes an evolutionary novelty, moveable teeth, which have enabled predatory feeding in this species and others in its family (Diplogastridae). From transmission electron micrographs of serial thin sections through an adult hermaphrodite of P. pacificus, we three-dimensionally reconstructed all epithelial and myoepithelial cells and syncytia, corresponding to 74 nuclei, of its face, mouth, and pharynx. We found that the epithelia that produce the predatory morphology of P. pacificus are identical to Caenorhabditis elegans in the number of cell classes and nuclei. However, differences in cell form, spatial relationships, and nucleus position correlate with gross morphological differences from C. elegans and outgroups. Moreover, we identified fine-structural features, especially in the anteriormost pharyngeal muscles, that underlie the conspicuous, left-right asymmetry that characterizes the P. pacificus feeding apparatus. Our reconstruction provides an anatomical map for studying the genetics of polyphenism, feeding behavior, and the development of novel form in a satellite model to C. elegans.",bilateral asymmetry; Caenorhabditis elegans; developmental plasticity; fine structure; novelty; transmission electron microscopy,2022,24,1-Feb,10.1111/ede.12397,1520-541X,13,112,177,1303,6,NA,250,5,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT,Growth rate mediates hidden developmental plasticity of female yellow dung fly reproductive morphology in response to environmental stressors,"Understanding how environmental variation influences even cryptic traits is important to clarify the roles of selection and developmental constraints in past evolutionary divergence and to predict future adaptation under environmental change. Female yellow dung flies (Scathophaga stercoraria) typically have three sperm storage compartments (3S), but occasionally four (4S). More spermathecae are thought to be a female adaptation facilitating sperm sorting after mating, but the phenotype is very rare in nature. We manipulated the flies' developmental environment by food restriction, pesticides, and hot temperatures to investigate the nature and extent of developmental plasticity of this trait, and whether spermatheca expression correlates with measures of performance and developmental stability, as would be expected if 4S expression is a developmental aberration. The spermathecal polymorphism of yellow dung fly females is heritable, but also highly developmentally plastic, varying strongly with rearing conditions. 4S expression is tightly linked to growth rate, and weakly positively correlated with fluctuating asymmetry of wings and legs, suggesting that the production of a fourth spermatheca could be a nonadaptive developmental aberration. However, spermathecal plasticity is opposite in the closely related and ecologically similar Scathophaga suilla, demonstrating that overexpression of spermathecae under developmental stress is not universal. At the same time, we found overall mortality costs as well as benefits of 4S pheno- and genotypes (also affecting male siblings), suggesting that a life history trade-off may potentially moderate 4S expression. We conclude that the release of cryptic genetic variation in spermatheca number in the face of strong environmental variation may expose hidden traits (here reproductive morphology) to natural selection (here under climate warming or food augmentation). Once exposed, hidden traits can potentially undergo rapid genetic assimilation, even in cases when trait changes are first triggered by random errors that destabilize developmental processes.",artificial selection; body size; developmental stability; Diptera; fluctuating asymmetry; growth rate; morphology; mortality; phenotypic plasticity; post-copulatory sexual selection; spermatheca; survival; temperature,2022,24,1-Feb,10.1111/ede.12396,1520-541X,18,141,291,2123,13,NA,250,5,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT,The role of heterotopy and heterochrony during morphological diversification of otocephalan epibranchial organs,"Epibranchial organs (EBOs), found in at least five of the eight otomorphan families, are used to aggregate small prey inside the buccopharyngeal cavity and range in morphological complexity from a singular, small slit on the pharyngeal roof to several, elongated soft tissue tubes. Despite broad phylogenetic representation, little is known about the origin, development, or evolution of EBOs. We hypothesize that both heterochronic and heterotopic changes throughout the evolution of EBOs are at the root of their morphological diversity. Heterochrony is a foundational explanation in developmental studies, however, heterotopy, a developmental change in spatial or topographical relationships, can have even more profound effects on a given structure but has received relatively little attention. Here, we investigate how developmental mechanisms may drive morphological diversity of EBOs within otomorphan fishes. We compare early pharyngeal development in three species, Anchoa mitchilli (Engraulidae) which has the most basic EBO, B. tyrannus (Clupeidae) which has a more complex EBO, and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Cyprinidae) which has the most complex EBO yet described. Using branchial arch growth rates and morphological analyses, we illustrate how both heterochronic and heterotopic mechanisms are responsible for some of the phenotypic diversity seen in otomorphan EBOs. Importantly, we also identify conserved developmental patterns that further our understanding of how EBOs may have first originated and evolved across actinopterygian fishes.",development; evolution; novelty; origin; particulate feeding,2022,24,3-Apr,10.1111/ede.12401,1520-541X,13,111,217,1559,5,NA,250,5,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT,A cis-regulatory change underlying the motor neuron-specific loss of Ebf expression in immotile tunicate larvae,"Many species in the tunicate family Molgulidae have independently lost their swimming larval form and instead develop as tailless, immotile larvae. These larvae do not develop structures that are essential for swimming such as the notochord, otolith, and tail muscles. However, little is known about neural development in these nonswimming larvae. Here, we studied the patterning of the Motor Ganglion (MG) of Molgula occulta, a nonswimming species. We found that spatial patterns of MG neuron regulators in this species are conserved, compared with species with swimming larvae, suggesting that the gene networks regulating their expression are intact despite the loss of swimming. However, expression of the key motor neuron regulatory gene Ebf (Collier/Olf/EBF) was reduced in the developing MG of M. occulta when compared with molgulid species with swimming larvae. This was corroborated by measuring allele-specific expression of Ebf in hybrid embryos from crosses of M. occulta with the swimming species M. oculata. Heterologous reporter construct assays in the model tunicate species Ciona robusta revealed a specific cis-regulatory sequence change that reduces expression of Ebf in the MG, but not in other cells. Taken together, these data suggest that MG neurons are still specified in M. occulta larvae, but their differentiation might be impaired due to reduction of Ebf expression levels.",Cis\&\#8208; regulatory changes; Collier; Olf; EBF; evolutionary loss; Molgula; motor neurons; tunicates,2021,23,2,10.1111/ede.12364,1520-541X,15,111,211,1401,9,NA,250,5,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Divergence and introgression among the virilis group of Drosophila,"Speciation with gene flow is now widely regarded as common. However, the frequency of introgression between recently diverged species and the evolutionary consequences of gene flow are still poorly understood. The virilis group of Drosophila contains 12 species that are geographically widespread and show varying levels of prezygotic and postzygotic isolation. Here, we use de novo genome assemblies and whole-genome sequencing data to resolve phylogenetic relationships and describe patterns of introgression and divergence across the group. We suggest that the virilis group consists of three, rather than the traditional two, subgroups. Some genes undergoing rapid sequence divergence across the group were involved in chemical communication and desiccation tolerance, and may be related to the evolution of sexual isolation and adaptation. We found evidence of pervasive phylogenetic discordance caused by ancient introgression events between distant lineages within the group, and more recent gene flow between closely related species. When assessing patterns of genome-wide divergence in species pairs across the group, we found no consistent genomic evidence of a disproportionate role for the X chromosome as has been found in other systems. Our results show how ancient and recent introgressions confuse phylogenetic reconstruction, but may play an important role during early radiation of a group.",Divergence; gene flow; introgression; phylogenomics; reproductive isolation; speciation,2022,6,6,10.1002/evl3.301,NA,9,66,203,1408,6,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Rapid genomic convergent evolution in experimental populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata),"Although rapid phenotypic evolution has been documented often, the genomic basis of rapid adaptation to natural environments is largely unknown in multicellular organisms. Population genomic studies of experimental populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) provide a unique opportunity to study this phenomenon. Guppy populations that were transplanted from high-predation (HP) to low-predation (LP) environments have been shown to evolve toward the phenotypes of naturally colonized LP populations in as few as eight generations. These changes persist in common garden experiments, indicating that they have a genetic basis. Here, we report results of whole genome variation in four experimental populations colonizing LP sites along with the corresponding HP source population. We examined genome-wide patterns of genetic variation to estimate past demography and used a combination of genome scans, forward simulations, and a novel analysis of allele frequency change vectors to uncover the signature of selection. We detected clear signals of population growth and bottlenecks at the genome-wide level that matched the known history of population numbers. We found a region on chromosome 15 under strong selection in three of the four populations and with our multivariate approach revealing subtle parallel changes in allele frequency in all four populations across this region. Investigating patterns of genome-wide selection in this uniquely replicated experiment offers remarkable insight into the mechanisms underlying rapid adaptation, providing a basis for comparison with other species and populations experiencing rapidly changing environments.",Convergent evolution; experimental evolution; guppies; Poecilia reticulata; population genomics; rapid evolution,2022,6,2,10.1002/evl3.272,NA,12,107,233,1672,6,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Unique bone microanatomy reveals ancestry of subterranean specializations in mammals,"Acquiring a subterranean lifestyle entails a substantial shift for many aspects of terrestrial vertebrates' biology. Although this lifestyle is associated with multiple instances of convergent evolution, the relative success of some subterranean lineages largely remains unexplained. Here, we focus on the mammalian transitions to life underground, quantifying bone microanatomy through high-resolution X-ray tomography. The true moles stand out in this dataset. Examination of this family's bone histology reveals that the highly fossorial moles acquired a unique phenotype involving large amounts of compacted coarse cancellous bone. This phenotype exceeds the adaptive optimum seemingly shared by several other subterranean mammals and can be traced back to some of the first known members of the family. This remarkable microanatomy was acquired early in the history of the group and evolved faster than the gross morphology innovations of true moles' forelimb. This echoes the pattern described for other lifestyle transitions, such as the acquisition of bone mass specializations in secondarily aquatic tetrapods. Highly plastic traits-such as those pertaining to bone structure-are hence involved in the early stages of different types of lifestyle transitions.",Bone histology; compacted coarse cancellous bone; osteogenesis; phenotypic plasticity; subterranean mammals; Talpidae,2022,6,6,10.1002/evl3.303,NA,10,84,179,1268,6,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Strong selective environments determine evolutionary outcome in time-dependent fitness seascapes,"The impact of fitness landscape features on evolutionary outcomes has attracted considerable interest in recent decades. However, evolution often occurs under time-dependent selection in so-called fitness seascapes where the landscape is under flux. Fitness seascapes are an inherent feature of natural environments, where the landscape changes owing both to the intrinsic fitness consequences of previous adaptations and extrinsic changes in selected traits caused by new environments. The complexity of such seascapes may curb the predictability of evolution. However, empirical efforts to test this question using a comprehensive set of regimes are lacking. Here, we employed an in vitro microbial model system to investigate differences in evolutionary outcomes between time-invariant and time-dependent environments, including all possible temporal permutations, with three subinhibitory antimicrobials and a viral parasite (phage) as selective agents. Expectedly, time-invariant environments caused stronger directional selection for resistances compared to time-dependent environments. Intriguingly, however, multidrug resistance outcomes in both cases were largely driven by two strong selective agents (rifampicin and phage) out of four agents in total. These agents either caused cross-resistance or obscured the phenotypic effect of other resistance mutations, modulating the evolutionary outcome overall in time-invariant environments and as a function of exposure epoch in time-dependent environments. This suggests that identifying strong selective agents and their pleiotropic effects is critical for predicting evolution in fitness seascapes, with ramifications for evolutionarily informed strategies to mitigate drug resistance evolution.",Antibiotic resistance; Escherichia coli; experimental evolution; fitness seascape; fluctuating selection; microbial evolution; phage resistance; pleiotropy; sub-MIC; time-dependent selection,2022,6,3,10.1002/evl3.284,NA,10,96,229,1755,10,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Limited sex differences in plastic responses suggest evolutionary conservatism of thermal reaction norms: A meta-analysis in insects,"Temperature has a profound effect on the growth and development of ectothermic animals. However, the extent to which ecologically driven selection pressures can adjust thermal plastic responses in growth schedules is not well understood. Comparing temperature-induced plastic responses between sexes provides a promising but underexploited approach to evaluating the evolvability of thermal reaction norms: males and females share largely the same genes and immature environments but typically experience different ecological selection pressures. We proceed from the idea that substantial sex differences in plastic responses could be interpreted as resulting from sex-specific life-history optimization, whereas similarity among the sexes should rather be seen as evidence of an essential role of physiological constraints. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of sex-specific thermal responses in insect development times, using data on 161 species with comprehensive phylogenetic and ecological coverage. As a reference for judging the magnitude of sex specificity in thermal plasticity, we compared the magnitude of sex differences in plastic responses to temperature with those in response to diet. We show that sex-specific responses of development times to temperature variation are broadly similar. We also found no strong evidence for sex specificity in thermal responses to depend on the magnitude or direction of sex differences in development time. Sex differences in temperature-induced plastic responses were systematically less pronounced than sex differences in responses induced by variations in larval diet. Our results point to the existence of substantial constraints on the evolvability of thermal reaction norms in insects as the most likely explanation. If confirmed, the low evolvability of thermal response is an essential aspect to consider in predicting evolutionary responses to climate warming.",Body size; development rate; evolutionary constraint; growth rate; sexual bimaturism; sexual size dimorphism; thermal sensitivity; thermal trait,2022,6,6,10.1002/evl3.299,NA,17,132,272,1930,8,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Adaptive divergence and the evolution of hybrid trait mismatch in threespine stickleback,"Selection against mismatched traits in hybrids is the phenotypic analogue of intrinsic hybrid incompatibilities. Mismatch occurs when hybrids resemble one parent population for some phenotypic traits and the other parent population for other traits, and is caused by dominance in opposing directions or from segregation of alleles in recombinant hybrids. In this study, we used threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) to test the theoretical prediction that trait mismatch in hybrids should increase with the magnitude of phenotypic divergence between parent populations. We measured morphological traits in parents and hybrids in crosses between a marine population representing the ancestral form and twelve freshwater populations that have diverged from this ancestral state to varying degrees according to their environments. We found that trait mismatch was greater in more divergent crosses for both F-1 and F-2 hybrids. In the F-1, the divergence-mismatch relationship was caused by traits having dominance in different directions, whereas it was caused by increasing segregating phenotypic variation in the F-2. Our results imply that extrinsic hybrid incompatibilities accumulate as phenotypic divergence proceeds.",Ecological speciation; hybridization; opposing dominance,2022,6,1,10.1002/evl3.264,NA,12,88,174,1239,3,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Context dependence in the symbiosis between Dictyostelium discoideum and Paraburkholderia,"Many organisms form symbiotic relationships with other species. These symbioses often exhibit context dependence, where the sign or magnitude of one partner's effect on the other will change in different environments. Context-dependent effects make it difficult to assign interactions to categories like mutualisms or antagonisms because they involve both benefits and costs depending on the environment. However, in some cases, accounting for context dependence can clarify an interaction so that it more easily fits a mutualism or antagonism. We investigated context dependence using the symbiosis between Dictyostelium discoideum and two symbiotic Paraburkholderia species. In this symbiosis, Paraburkholderia bacteria allow hosts to carry food bacteria to food-poor contexts, where hosts rarely survive without food, but reduce host fitness in the more hospitable food-rich contexts. The effect of food context on Paraburkholderia symbionts is unknown. We show that Paraburkholderia symbionts are also affected by this context, through facing reduced competition after being dispersed by hosts to food-poor contexts. We also identify a new way that symbionts affect hosts, where symbiont density reduces host fitness, but less so in food-poor contexts. Finally, we use simulations to show that infected hosts benefit in the long term across variable food contexts, especially in the harshest environments with little food. These results show that context dependence in symbiosis can have many consequences for hosts and symbionts, although in general for D. discoideum and Paraburkholderia, both are likely to benefit.",Bet-hedging; competition; context dependence; Dictyostelium discoideum; Paraburkholderia; symbiosis,2022,6,3,10.1002/evl3.281,NA,10,89,233,1622,6,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Detection of sexually antagonistic transmission distortions in trio datasets,"Sexual dimorphisms are widespread in animals and plants, for morphological as well as physiological traits. Understanding the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism and its evolution is crucial for understanding biological differences between the sexes. Genetic variants with sex-antagonistic effects on fitness are expected to segregate in populations at the early phases of sexual dimorphism emergence. Detecting such variants is notoriously difficult, and the few genome-scan methods employed so far have limited power and little specificity. Here, we propose a new framework to detect a signature of sexually antagonistic (SA) selection. We rely on trio datasets where sex-biased transmission distortions can be directly tracked from parents to offspring, and identify signals of SA transmission distortions in genomic regions. We report the genomic location of six candidate regions detected in human populations as potentially under sexually antagonist selection. We find an enrichment of genes associated with embryonic development within these regions. Last, we highlight two candidate regions for SA selection in humans.",Human population genetics; intralocus sexual conflict; sexual dimorphisms; sexually antagonistic selection; transmission distortion,2022,6,2,10.1002/evl3.271,NA,9,76,160,1125,5,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Allometric conservatism in the evolution of bird beaks,"Evolution can involve periods of rapid divergent adaptation and expansion in the range of diversity, but evolution can also be relatively conservative over certain timescales due to functional, genetic-developmental, and ecological constraints. One way in which evolution may be conservative is in terms of allometry, the scaling relationship between the traits of organisms and body size. Here, we investigate patterns of allometric conservatism in the evolution of bird beaks with beak size and body size data for a representative sample of over 5000 extant bird species within a phylogenetic framework. We identify clades in which the allometric relationship between beak size and body size has remained relatively conserved across species over millions to tens of millions of years. We find that allometric conservatism is nonetheless punctuated by occasional shifts in the slopes and intercepts of allometric relationships. A steady accumulation of such shifts through time has given rise to the tremendous diversity of beak size relative to body size across birds today. Our findings are consistent with the Simpsonian vision of macroevolution, with evolutionary conservatism being the rule but with occasional shifts to new adaptive zones.",Allometry; bird beaks; constraints; evolutionary conservatism,2022,6,1,10.1002/evl3.267,NA,8,54,186,1246,4,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Interacting host modifier systems control Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility in a haplodiploid mite,"Reproductive parasites such as Wolbachia spread within host populations by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI occurs when parasite-modified sperm fertilizes uninfected eggs and is typified by great variation in strength across biological systems. In haplodiploid hosts, CI has different phenotypic outcomes depending on whether the fertilized eggs die or develop into males. Genetic conflict theories predict the evolution of host modulation of CI, which in turn influences the stability of reproductive parasitism. However, despite the ubiquity of CI-inducing parasites in nature, there is scarce evidence for intraspecific host modulation of CI strength and phenotype. Here, we tested for intraspecific host modulation of Wolbachia-induced CI in haplodiploid Tetranychus urticae mites. Using a single CI-inducing Wolbachia variant and mitochondrion, a nuclear panel was created that consisted of infected and cured near-isogenic lines. We performed a highly replicated age-synchronized full diallel cross composed of incompatible and compatible control crosses. We uncovered host modifier systems that cause striking variation in CI strength when carried by infected T. urticae males. We observed a continuum of CI phenotypes in our crosses and identified strong intraspecific female modulation of the CI phenotype. Crosses established a recessive genetic basis for the maternal effect and were consistent with polygenic Mendelian inheritance. Both male and female modulation interacted with the genotype of the mating partner. Our findings identify spermatogenesis as an important target of selection for host modulation of CI strength and underscore the importance of maternal genetic effects for the CI phenotype. Our findings reveal that intraspecific host modulation of CI is underpinned by complex genetic architectures and confirm that the evolution of reproductive parasitism is contingent on host genetics.",Genetic conflict; host modification; pest control; reproductive parasitism,2022,6,3,10.1002/ev13.282,NA,12,110,271,1928,4,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Conceptualizing the evolutionary quantitative genetics of phenological life-history events: Breeding time as a plastic threshold trait,"Successfully predicting adaptive phenotypic responses to environmental changes, and predicting resulting population outcomes, requires that additive genetic (co)variances underlying microevolutionary and plastic responses of key traits are adequately estimated on appropriate quantitative scales. Such estimation in turn requires that focal traits, and their underlying quantitative genetic architectures, are appropriately conceptualized. Here, we highlight that directly analyzing observed phenotypes as continuously distributed quantitative traits can potentially generate biased and misleading estimates of additive genetic variances and individual-by-environment and gene-by-environment interactions, and hence of forms of plasticity and genetic constraints, if in fact the underlying biology is best conceptualized as an environmentally sensitive threshold trait. We illustrate this scenario with particular reference to the key phenological trait of seasonal breeding date, which has become a focus for quantifying joint microevolutionary, plastic, and population responses to environmental change, but has also become a focus for highlighting that predicted adaptive outcomes are not always observed. Specifically, we use simple simulations to illustrate how potentially misleading inferences on magnitudes of additive genetic variance, and forms of environmental interactions, can arise by directly analyzing observed breeding dates if the transition to breeding in fact represents a threshold trait with latent-scale plasticity. We summarize how existing and new datasets could be (re)analyzed, potentially providing new insights into how critical microevolutionary and plastic phenological responses to environmental variation and change can arise and be constrained.",Additive genetic variance; breeding date; gene-by-environment interaction; phenology; phenotypic plasticity; quantitative genetics; reaction norm; threshold trait,2022,6,3,10.1002/evl3.278,NA,16,134,227,1778,8,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Interspecific variation in cooperative burrowing behavior by Peromyscus mice,"Animals often adjust their behavior according to social context, but the capacity for such behavioral flexibility can vary among species. Here, we test for interspecific variation in behavioral flexibility by comparing burrowing behavior across three species of deer mice (genus Peromyscus) with divergent social systems, ranging from promiscuous (Peromyscus leucopus and Peromyscus maniculatus) to monogamous (Peromyscus polionotus). First, we compared the burrows built by individual mice to those built by pairs of mice in all three species. Although burrow length did not differ in P. leucopus or P. maniculatus, we found that P. polionotus pairs cooperatively constructed burrows that were nearly twice as long as those built by individuals and that opposite-sex pairs dug longer burrows than same-sex pairs. Second, to directly observe cooperative digging behavior in P. polionotus, we designed a burrowing assay in which we could video-record active digging in narrow, transparent enclosures. Using this novel assay, we found, unexpectedly, that neither males nor females spent more time digging with an opposite-sex partner. Rather, we demonstrate that opposite-sex pairs are more socially cohesive and thus more efficient digging partners than same-sex pairs. Together, our study demonstrates how social context can modulate innate behavior and offers insight into how differences in behavioral flexibility may evolve among closely related species.",Animal architecture; burrow; cooperation; deer mouse; social cohesion,2022,6,4,10.1002/evl3.293,NA,9,76,210,1457,5,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,Plant-associate interactions and diversification across trophic levels,"Interactions between species are widely understood to have promoted the diversification of life on Earth, but how interactions spur the formation of new species remains unclear. Interacting species often become locally adapted to each other, but they may also be subject to shared dispersal limitations and environmental conditions. Moreover, theory predicts that different kinds of interactions have different effects on diversification. To better understand how species interactions promote diversification, we compiled population genetic studies of host plants and intimately associated herbivores, parasites, and mutualists. We used Bayesian multiple regressions and the BEDASSLE modeling framework to test whether host and associate population structures were correlated over and above the potentially confounding effects of geography and shared environmental variation. We found that associates' population structure often paralleled their hosts' population structure, and that this effect is robust to accounting for geographic distance and climate. Associate genetic structure was significantly explained by plant genetic structure somewhat more often in antagonistic interactions than in mutualistic ones. This aligns with a key prediction of coevolutionary theory that antagonistic interactions promote diversity through local adaptation of antagonists to hosts, while mutualistic interactions more often promote diversity via the effect of hosts' geographic distribution on mutualists' dispersal.",Herbivory; local adaptation; mutualism; population structure; parasitism,2022,6,5,10.1002/evl3.296,NA,7,70,200,1507,5,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,The ecology and quantitative genetics of seed and seedling traits in upland and lowland ecotypes of a perennial grass,"Plants have evolved diverse reproductive allocation strategies and seed traits to aid in dispersal, persistence in the seed bank, and establishment. In particular, seed size, dormancy, and early seedling vigor are thought to be key functional traits with important recruitment and fitness consequences across abiotic stress gradients. Selection for favored seed-trait combinations, or against maladaptive combinations, is likely an important driver shaping recruitment strategies. Here, we test for seed-trait plasticity and patterns of recruitment using two genotypes representative of contrasting upland and lowland ecotypes of Panicum hallii with field experiments in native versus foreign habitats. Furthermore, we test whether seed traits have been under directional selection in P. hallii using the v-test based on trait variance in a genetic cross. Finally, we evaluate the genetic architecture of ecotypic divergence for these traits with quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Field experiments reveal little plasticity but support a hypothesis of adaptation divergence among ecotypes based on recruitment. Patterns of segregation within recombinant hybrids provides strong support for directional selection driving ecotypic divergence in seed traits. Genetic mapping revealed a polygenic architecture with evidence of genetic correlation between seed mass, dormancy, and seedling vigor. Our results suggest that the evolution of these traits may involve constraints that affect the direction of adaptive divergence. For example, seed size and germination percentage shared two colocalized QTL with antagonistic additive effects. This supports the hypothesis of a functional genetic relationship between these traits, resulting in either large seed/strong dormancy or small seed/weak dormancy trait combinations. Overall, our study provides insights into the factors facilitating and potentially constraining ecotypic differentiation in seed traits.",Dormancy; ecotypic divergence; Panicum hallii; QTL; quantitative genetics; reciprocal transplantation; seed size,2022,6,6,10.1002/evl3.297,NA,19,117,266,1959,7,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION LETTERS,The genomic signature of wild-to-crop introgression during the domestication of scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus L.),"The scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus) is one of the five domesticated Phaseolus species. It is cultivated in small-scale agriculture in the highlands of Mesoamerica for its dry seeds and immature pods, and unlike the other domesticated beans, P. coccineus is an open-pollinated legume. Contrasting with its close relative, the common bean, few studies focusing on its domestication history have been conducted. Demographic bottlenecks associated with domestication might reduce genetic diversity and facilitate the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Conversely, introgression from wild relatives could be a source of variation. Using Genotyping by Sequencing data (79,286 single-nucleotide variants) from 237 cultivated and wild samples, we evaluated the demographic history of traditional varieties from different regions of Mexico and looked for evidence of introgression between sympatric wild and cultivated populations. Traditional varieties have high levels of diversity, even though there is evidence of a severe initial genetic bottleneck followed by a population expansion. Introgression from wild to domesticated populations was detected, which might contribute to the recovery of the genetic variation. Introgression has occurred at different times: constantly in the center of Mexico; recently in the North West; and anciently in the South. Several factors are acting together to increase and maintain genetic diversity in P. coccineus cultivars, such as demographic expansion and introgression. Wild relatives represent a valuable genetic resource and have played a key role in scarlet runner bean evolution via introgression into traditional varieties.",Domestication; gene flow; introgression; legumes; population genomics; wild relatives,2022,6,4,10.1002/evl3.285,NA,16,124,235,1678,6,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

We performed a highly replicated age-synchronized full diallel cross composed of incompatible and compatible control crosses. We uncovered host modifier systems that cause striking variation in CI strength when carried by infected T. urticae males. We observed a continuum of CI phenotypes in our crosses and identified strong intraspecific female modulation of the CI phenotype. Crosses established a recessive genetic basis for the maternal effect and were consistent with polygenic Mendelian inheritance. Both male and female modulation interacted with the genotype of the mating partner. Our findings identify spermatogenesis as an important target of selection for host modulation of CI strength and underscore the importance of maternal genetic effects for the CI phenotype. Our findings reveal that intraspecific host modulation of CI is underpinned by complex genetic architectures and confirm that the evolution of reproductive parasitism is contingent on host genetics.",Genetic conflict; host modification; pest control; reproductive parasitism,2022,6,3,10.1002/evl3.282,NA,12,110,271,1928,4,30,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,An orally administered drug prevents selection for antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the gut during daptomycin therapy,"Background and objectives Previously, we showed proof-of-concept in a mouse model that oral administration of cholestyramine prevented enrichment of daptomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract during daptomycin therapy. Cholestyramine binds daptomycin in the gut, which removes daptomycin selection pressure and so prevents the enrichment of resistant clones. Here, we investigated two open questions related to this approach: (i) can cholestyramine prevent the enrichment of diverse daptomycin mutations emerging de novo in the gut? and (ii) how does the timing of cholestyramine administration impact its ability to suppress resistance? Methodology Mice with GI E. faecium were treated with daptomycin with or without cholestyramine, and E. faecium was cultured from feces to measure changes in daptomycin susceptibility. A subset of clones was sequenced to investigate the genomic basis of daptomycin resistance. Results Cholestyramine prevented the enrichment of diverse resistance mutations that emerged de novo in daptomycin-treated mice. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that resistance emerged through multiple genetic pathways, with most candidate resistance mutations observed in the clsA gene. In addition, we observed that cholestyramine was most effective when administration started prior to the first dose of daptomycin. However, beginning cholestyramine after the first daptomycin dose reduced the frequency of resistant E. faecium compared to not using cholestyramine at all. Conclusions and implications Cholestyramine prevented the enrichment of diverse daptomycin-resistance mutations in intestinal E. faecium populations during daptomycin treatment, and it is a promising tool for managing the transmission of daptomycin-resistant E. faecium. Lay Summary Intravenous antibiotics can select for drug-resistant bacteria in the gut. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for preventing this selection in a mouse model. We show that an orally administered drug can capture antibiotic in the gut, thus preventing selection for resistance. This strategy allows for antibiotic treatment while reducing transmission of resistance.",daptomycin; Enterococcus faecium; antimicrobial resistance; antimicrobial stewardship,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac035,NA,15,117,295,2170,4,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Associations of age at marriage and first pregnancy with maternal nutritional status in Nepal,"Lay Summary In lowland Nepal, the primary determinant of women's nutritional status was age at pregnancy. However, among those pregnant early, those married earlier had poorer nutritional status, suggesting they were married to ameliorate food insecurity. Marriage age determines which household funds adolescent weight gain, with fitness implications for members of both households. Background and objectives Women's nutritional status is important for their health and reproductive fitness. In a population where early marriage is common, we investigated how women's nutritional status is associated with their age at marriage (marking a geographical transfer between households), and at first pregnancy. Methodology We used data from a cluster-randomized control trial from lowland Nepal (n = 4071). Outcomes including body mass index (BMI) were measured in early pregnancy and trial endpoint, after delivery. We fitted mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models to estimate associations of age at marriage and age at pregnancy with outcomes, and with odds of chronic energy deficiency (CED, BMI <18.5 kg/m(2)), at both timepoints. Results BMI in early pregnancy averaged 20.9 kg/m(2), with CED prevalence of 12.5\%. In 750 women measured twice, BMI declined 1.2 (95\% confidence interval 1.1, 1.3) kg/m(2) between early pregnancy and endpoint, when CED prevalence was 35.5\%. Early pregnancy was associated in dose-response manner with poorer nutritional status. Early marriage was independently associated with poorer nutritional status among those pregnant <= 15 years, but with better nutritional status among those pregnant >= 19 years. Conclusions and implications The primary determinant of nutritional status was age at pregnancy, but this association also varied by marriage age. Our results suggest that natal households may marry their daughters earlier if food insecure, but that their nutritional status can improve in the marital household if pregnancy is delayed. Marriage age therefore determines which household funds adolescent weight gain, with implications for Darwinian fitness of the members of both households.",child marriage; pregnancy; maternal nutrition; maternal capital; reproductive scheduling,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac025,NA,14,93,309,2145,5,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Different predictors of intimate partner and natal family violence against women,"Background Violence against women is often studied in the context of violence from intimate partners. However, women receive violence from a wider range of individuals-such as their natal kin-including their siblings, parents, uncles and cousins. Applying insights from evolutionary theory, we examine whether cousin marriage, which has been hypothesized to both reduce the risk of partner violence but increase the risk of natal family violence, associates differently with each type of violence. Second, we test whether common risk factors for partner violence, such as wealth, associate similarly with natal violence. Methodology We analyse over 16 000 Jordanian women from three cohorts of the Jordan Demographic Health Surveys. Predictor variables include type of cousin marriage (patrilateral or matrilateral), education, wealth, number of children, urban living and polygyny. Outcome variables include whether a woman's husband or her natal family has ever been physically violent towards her. Results Being married to a patrilateral cousin but not a matrilateral cousin is associated with a reduced risk of reporting intimate partner violence (IPV). By contrast being married to a matrilateral cousin but not a patrilateral one is associated with a reduced risk of reporting natal family violence. As expected, wealth is negatively associated with reporting partner violence, but we find no association with reports of natal family violence. Finally, individuals with more children are more likely to report IPV. Conclusions and implications Findings indicate the importance of distinguishing between types of cousin marriage and highlight substantial differences in risk factors for intimate partner compared to natal family violence. Lay Summary Sociodemographic risk factors, such as wealth, may associate differently with intimate partner and natal family violence. Results suggest that whether cousin marriage is protective of violence may depend on the type of cousin and secondly, that violence can have fitness relevant outcomes.",violence against women; Jordan; cousin marriage; sexual conflict; parents-offspring conflict,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac019,NA,11,80,297,2045,5,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"Early life adversity, reproductive history and breast cancer risk","Background and objectives Individuals who experience early life adversity are at an increased risk for chronic disease later in life. Less is known about how early life factors are associated with cancer susceptibility. Here, we use a life history framework to test whether early life adversity increases the risk of breast cancer. We predict that early life adversity can shift investment in somatic maintenance and accelerate the timing of reproduction, which may mediate or interact with the risk of breast cancer. Methodology We use population-wide data from the Utah Population Database (UPDB) and Utah Cancer Registry, leading to 24 957 cases of women diagnosed with breast cancer spanning 20 years (1990-2010) and 124 785 age-matched controls. We generated a cumulative early life adversity summation score to evaluate the interaction (moderation) and mediation between early life adversity, reproductive history and their association with breast cancer risk. Results Our analyses led to three key findings: (i) more early life adversity, when considered as a main effect, accelerates the time to first birth and death, (ii) early age at first birth and high parity decreases the risk of breast cancer and (iii) we find no association between early adversity and breast cancer risk either as a main effect or in its interaction with reproductive history. Conclusion and implications Early adversity elevates the risk of overall mortality through mechanisms other than breast cancer risk. This suggests early life factors can generate different effects on health. Future work should incorporate more complex view of life history patterns, including multiple life stages, when making predictions about cancer susceptibility. Lay Summary Previous work has shown that childhood adversity can contribute to poor health later in life. We tested whether childhood adversity was associated with increased risk of breast cancer in US women. We found that childhood adversity was associated with earlier age at first birth but not higher breast cancer risk.",early life adversity; breast cancer; health disparity; life history; reproduction,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac034,NA,9,65,314,2054,5,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"Early life, life course and gender influences on levels of C-reactive protein among migrant Bangladeshis in the UK","Background and objectives Humans co-evolved with pathogens, especially helminths, that educate the immune system during development and lower inflammatory responses. The absence of such stimuli in industrialized countries is associated with higher baseline levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) among adults who appear at greater risk for inflammatory disorders. This cross-sectional study examined effects of early life development on salivary CRP levels in 452 British-Bangladeshis who spent varying periods growing up in Bangladesh or UK. We also analyzed how gender and central obesity modulate effects on CRP. We hypothesized that: (i) first-generation Bangladeshis with higher childhood exposure to pathogens would have chronically lower CRP levels than second-generation British-Bangladeshis; (ii) effects would be greater with early childhoods in Bangladesh; (iii) effects by gender would differ; and (iv) increasing obesity would mitigate early life effects. Methodology Saliva samples were assayed for CRP using ELISAs, and anthropometric data collected. Participants completed questionnaires about demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle and health histories. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results First-generation migrants who spent early childhoods in mostly rural, unhygienic areas, and moved to UK after age 8, had lower salivary CRP compared to the second-generation. Effects differed by gender, while waist circumference predicted higher CRP levels. CRP increased with years in UK, alongside growing obesity. Conclusions and implications Our study supports the hypothesis that pathogen exposure in early life lowers inflammatory responses in adults. However, protective effects differed by gender and can be eroded by growing obesity across the life course which elevates risks for other inflammatory disorders. Lay Summary: Migrants to the UK who spent early childhoods in less hygienic environments in Bangladesh that help to educate their immune systems had lower levels of the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to migrants who grew up in UK. Both gender and increasing obesity were associated with increased levels of CRP.",C-reactive protein; inflammation; early life development; gender; Bangladeshi migrants; obesity,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoab041,NA,18,114,305,2182,6,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Evolution of higher mesenchymal CD44 expression in the human lineage A gene linked to cancer malignancy,"Lay Summary While all multicellular organisms can develop tumors, cancer mortality is, to a large degree, determined by the tendency of tumors to progress to malignant cancer, i.e. the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body. There are large differences in the rate of cancer malignancy, with many hoofed animals (cow, horses, etc.), for instance, less vulnerable to malignancy than say humans. In order to understand the species differences in cancer malignancy, we investigated the evolutionary changes in the expression of a gene that has been implicated in cancer malignancy, called CD44. We find that the primate lineage has evolved high levels of CD44 expression, while that in other animals remained comparatively modest. This result suggests that the expression of this gene might explain, in part, the human vulnerability to malignant cancer. CD44 is an extracellular matrix receptor implicated in cancer progression. CD44 increases the invasibility of skin (SF) and endometrial stromal fibroblasts (ESF) by cancer and trophoblast cells. We reasoned that the evolution of CD44 expression can affect both, the fetal-maternal interaction through CD44 in ESF as well as vulnerability to malignant cancer through expression in SF. We studied the evolution of CD44 expression in mammalian SF and ESF and demonstrate that in the human lineage evolved higher CD44 expression. Isoform expression in cattle and human is very similar suggesting that differences in invasibility are not due to the nature of expressed isoforms. We then asked whether the concerted gene expression increase in both cell types is due to shared regulatory mechanisms or due to cell type-specific factors. Reporter gene experiments with cells and cis-regulatory elements from human and cattle show that the difference of CD44 expression is due to cis effects as well as cell type-specific trans effects. These results suggest that the concerted expression increase is likely due to selection acting on both cell types because the evolutionary change in cell type-specific factors requires selection on cell type-specific functions. This scenario implies that the malignancy enhancing effects of elevated CD44 expression in humans likely evolved as a side-effect of positive selection on a yet unidentified other function of CD44. A possible candidate is the anti-fibrotic effect of CD44 but there are no reliable data showing that humans and primates are less fibrotic than other mammals.",CD44; cancer; gene regulation; malignancy; evolution; endometrium,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac036,NA,16,103,381,2475,6,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Evolved resistance to a novel cationic peptide antibiotic requires high mutation supply,"Lay Summary Antimicrobial resistance is a significant challenge in evolutionary biology and medicine. New compounds are scant and must be designed to avoid resistance. We experimentally manipulated mutation supply to define the causes of resistance to a promising cationic peptide antibiotic as well as the probability that it will evolve during treatment. Background and Objectives A key strategy for resolving the antibiotic resistance crisis is the development of new drugs with antimicrobial properties. The engineered cationic antimicrobial peptide WLBU2 (also known as PLG0206) is a promising broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound that has completed Phase I clinical studies. It has activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including infections associated with biofilm. No definitive mechanisms of resistance to WLBU2 have been identified. Methodology Here, we used experimental evolution under different levels of mutation supply and whole genome sequencing (WGS) to detect the genetic pathways and probable mechanisms of resistance to this peptide. We propagated populations of wild-type and hypermutator Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of WLBU2 and performed WGS of evolved populations and clones. Results Populations that survived WLBU2 treatment acquired a minimum of two mutations, making the acquisition of resistance more difficult than for most antibiotics, which can be tolerated by mutation of a single target. Major targets of resistance to WLBU2 included the orfN and pmrB genes, previously described to confer resistance to other cationic peptides. More surprisingly, mutations that increase aggregation such as the wsp pathway were also selected despite the ability of WLBU2 to kill cells growing in a biofilm. Conclusions and implications The results show how experimental evolution and WGS can identify genetic targets and actions of new antimicrobial compounds and predict pathways to resistance of new antibiotics in clinical practice.",antimicrobial resistance; mutation rate; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; cationic peptide; Acinetobacter baumannii,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac022,NA,12,87,283,1984,5,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Exome sequencing of hepatocellular carcinoma in lemurs identifies potential cancer drivers A pilot study,"Background and objectives Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs frequently in prosimians, but the cause of these liver cancers in this group is unknown. Characterizing the genetic changes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in prosimians may point to possible causes, treatments and methods of prevention, aiding conservation efforts that are particularly crucial to the survival of endangered lemurs. Although genomic studies of cancer in non-human primates have been hampered by a lack of tools, recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using human exome capture reagents across primates. Methodology In this proof-of-principle study, we applied human exome capture reagents to tumor-normal pairs from five lemurs with hepatocellular carcinoma to characterize the mutational landscape of this disease in lemurs. Results Several genes implicated in human hepatocellular carcinoma, including ARID1A, TP53 and CTNNB1, were mutated in multiple lemurs, and analysis of cancer driver genes mutated in these samples identified enrichment of genes involved with TP53 degradation and regulation. In addition to these similarities with human hepatocellular carcinoma, we also noted unique features, including six genes that contain mutations in all five lemurs. Interestingly, these genes are infrequently mutated in human hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting potential differences in the etiology and/or progression of this cancer in lemurs and humans. Conclusions and implications Collectively, this pilot study suggests that human exome capture reagents are a promising tool for genomic studies of cancer in lemurs and other non-human primates. Lay Summary Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs frequently in prosimians, but the cause of these liver cancers is unknown.

EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Girls start life on an uneven playing field Evidence from lowland rural Nepal,"Lay Summary We explored whether mothers with lower socio-economic and reproductive capital were more likely to give birth to girls than to boys. We found that girls were more likely than boys to be born to mothers with markers of reduced human capital, which has implications for their future health and fitness. Background and objectives Evolutionary research on the sex ratio at birth (SRB) has focused on explaining variability within and between populations, and whether parental fitness is maximized by producing daughters or sons. We tested predictors of SRB in a low-income setting, to understand whether girls differ from boys in their likelihood of being born into families with the capacity to invest in them, which has implications for their future health and fitness. Methodology We used data from a cluster randomized control trial from lowland rural Nepal (16 115 mother-child dyads). We applied principal component analysis to extract two composite indices reflecting maternal socio-economic and reproductive (parity, age) capital. We fitted mixed-effects logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios of having a girl in association with these individual factors and indices. Results The SRB was 112. Compared to the global reference SRB (105), there were seven missing girls per 100 boys. Uneducated, early-marrying, poorer and shorter mothers were more likely to give birth to girls. Analysing composite maternal indices, lower socio-economic and reproductive capital were independently associated with a greater likelihood of having a girl. Conclusions and implications In this population, girls start life facing composite disadvantages, being more likely than boys to be born to mothers with lower socio-economic status and reproductive capital. Both physiological and behavioural mechanisms may contribute to these epidemiological associations. Differential early exposure by sex to maternal factors may underpin intergenerational cycles of gender inequality, mediated by developmental trajectory, education and socio-economic status.",NA,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac029,NA,13,77,299,2061,NA,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Greater chronic morbidity is associated with greater fatigue in six countries A case of evolutionary mismatch?,"Background and objectives Human susceptibility to chronic non-communicable disease may be explained, in part, by mismatches between our evolved biology and contemporary environmental conditions. Disease-induced fatigue may function to reduce physical activity during acute infection, thereby making more energy available to mount an effective immune response. However, fatigue in the context of chronic disease may be maladaptive because long-term reductions in physical activity increase risks of disease progression and the acquisition of additional morbidities. Here, we test whether cumulative chronic morbidity is associated with subjective fatigue. Methodology We constructed a cumulative chronic morbidity score using self-reported diagnoses and algorithm-based assessments, and a subjective fatigue score based on four questionnaire items using cross-sectional survey data from the Study on global AGEing and adult health, which features large samples of adults from six countries (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa). Results In a mixed-effects linear model with participants nested in countries (N = 32 455), greater cumulative chronic morbidity is associated with greater subjective fatigue (beta = 0.34, SE = 0.005, P < 2e-16). This association replicates within each country and is robust to adjustment for key sociodemographic and physical covariates (sex, age, household wealth, physical function score, habitual physical activity, BMI and BMI2). Conclusions and implications Fatigue is a common but perhaps maladaptive neuropsychological response to chronic morbidity. Disease-induced fatigue may mediate a self-perpetuating cycle, in which chronic morbidity reduces physical activity, and less physical activity increases cumulative chronic morbidity. Longitudinal research is needed to test whether chronic morbidity, fatigue and physical activity form a cyclical feedback loop. Lay Summary: Fatigue during acute illness may promote recovery, but persistent fatigue in the context of chronic disease may make matters worse. We present evidence from six countries that more chronic disease is associated with more fatigue. This fatigue may reduce physical activity, which increases risks of acquiring additional chronic health problems.",chronic diseases; mental health; aging; epidemiology,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac011,NA,16,110,311,2271,4,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Heritage-specific oral microbiota in Indigenous Australian dental calculus,"Lay Summary The community of microorganisms in the mouth (oral microbiota) has recently been linked to several chronic diseases that disproportionately impact Indigenous Australians. In this study, oral microbiota differ significantly between Indigenous Australians and non-Indigenous counterparts, suggesting the microbiota could be a novel factor with the potential to improve Indigenous health outcomes. Background and objectives Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders (hereafter respectfully referred to as Indigenous Australians) experience a high burden of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Increased NCD risk is linked to oral diseases mediated by the oral microbiota, a microbial community influenced by both vertical transmission and lifestyle factors. As an initial step towards understanding the oral microbiota as a factor in Indigenous health, we present the first investigation of oral microbiota in Indigenous Australian adults. Methodology Dental calculus samples from Indigenous Australians with periodontal disease (PD; n = 13) and non-Indigenous individuals both with (n = 19) and without PD (n = 20) were characterized using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity, differentially abundant microbial taxa and taxa unique to different participant groups were analysed using QIIME2. Results Samples from Indigenous Australians were more phylogenetically diverse (Kruskal-Wallis H = 19.86, P = 8.3 x 10(-6)), differed significantly in composition from non-Indigenous samples (PERMANOVA pseudo-F = 10.42, P = 0.001) and contained a relatively high proportion of unique taxa not previously reported in the human oral microbiota (e.g. Endomicrobia). These patterns were robust to stratification by PD status. Oral microbiota diversity and composition also differed between Indigenous individuals living in different geographic regions. Conclusions and implications Indigenous Australians may harbour unique oral microbiota shaped by their long relationships with Country (ancestral homelands). Our findings have implications for understanding the origins of oral and systemic NCDs and for the inclusion of Indigenous peoples in microbiota research, highlighting the microbiota as a novel field of enquiry to improve Indigenous health.",microbiota; microbiome; Indigenous Australian; Aboriginal Australian; oral health; evolutionary medicine,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac024,NA,8,74,315,2297,6,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,How a pregnant woman's relationships with her siblings relate to her mental health: a prenatal allocare perspective,"Lay Summary Individuals may increase their number of indirect descendants by caring for a pregnant sister. Results suggest that it is not how often a pregnant woman sees, but rather, how frequently she communicates with siblings that is associated with less depression. Having sisters also was associated with less depression. Background In cooperatively breeding species, individuals may promote their inclusive fitness through allomothering. Humans exhibit some features of cooperative breeding, and previous studies have focused on allomothering by grandparents and juvenile siblings in the postnatal period. We hypothesize that a pregnant woman's relationships with her siblings (offspring's maternal aunts and uncles) are beneficial for maternal affect in ways that can enhance the siblings' inclusive fitness. Maternal affect during pregnancy is a salient target of allocare given the detrimental effects of antepartum mood disorders on birth and infant outcomes. Methodology We test our hypotheses in a cohort of pregnant Latina women in Southern California (N = 201). Predictor variables of interest include number of siblings a participant has, if she has sisters, frequency of seeing siblings, and frequency of communication with siblings. Outcome variables measuring maternal affect include depression, state anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety and perceived stress. Results Having at least one sister and greater frequency of communication with siblings were associated with fewer depressive symptoms during pregnancy. No significant associations were found between sibling variables and other measures of affect. Conclusion and implications Results suggest that how frequently you communicate with, and not how often you see, siblings could be protective against risk of antepartum depression. Sibling allomothering could impart effects through social-emotional support rather than instrumental support, as a strategy to benefit the prenatal environment in which future nieces and nephews develop. Allomothering may be particularly important in cultural contexts that value family relationships.

EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Immune cell type and DNA methylation vary with reproductive status in women: possible pathways for costs of reproduction,"Background Consistent with evolutionarily theorized costs of reproduction (CoR), reproductive history in women is associated with life expectancy and susceptibility to certain cancers, autoimmune disorders and metabolic disease. Immunological changes originating during reproduction may help explain some of these relationships. Methodology To explore the potential role of the immune system in female CoR, we characterized leukocyte composition and regulatory processes using DNA methylation (DNAm) in a cross-sectional cohort of young (20-22 years old) women differing in reproductive status. Results Compared to nulliparity, pregnancy was characterized by differential methylation at 828 sites, 96\% of which were hypomethylated and enriched for genes associated with T-cell activation, innate immunity, pre-eclampsia and neoplasia. Breastfeeding was associated with differential methylation at 1107 sites (71\% hypermethylated), enriched for genes involved in metabolism, immune self-recognition and neurogenesis. There were no significant differences in DNAm between nulliparous and parous women. However, compared to nullipara, pregnant women had lower proportions of B, CD4T, CD8T and natural killer (NK) cells, and higher proportions of granulocytes and monocytes. Monocyte counts were lower and NK counts higher among breastfeeding women, and remained so among parous women. Implications Our findings point to widespread differences in DNAm during pregnancy and lactation. These effects appear largely transient, but may accumulate with gravidity become detectable as women age. Nulliparous and parous women differed in leukocyte composition, consistent with more persistent effects of reproduction on cell type. These findings support transient (leukocyte DNAm) and persistent (cell composition) changes associated with reproduction in women, illuminating potential pathways contributing to CoR. Lay Summary: Evolutionary theory and epidemiology support costs of reproduction (CoR) to women's health that may involve changes in immune function. We report differences in immune cell composition and gene regulation during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While many of these differences appear transient, immune cell composition may remain, suggesting mechanisms for female CoR.",pregnancy; breastfeeding; epigenome; immunomethylomics; evolution,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac003,NA,18,120,304,2283,5,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Implications of leg length for metabolic health and fitness,"Background and objectives Several studies have linked longer legs with favorable adult metabolic health outcomes and greater offspring birth weight. A recent Mendelian randomization study suggested a causal link between height and cardiometabolic risk; however, the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. Methodology Using a cross-sectional design, we tested in a convenience sample of 70 healthy young women whether birth weight and tibia length as markers of early-life conditions associated more strongly with metabolically beneficial traits like organ size and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) than a statistically derived height-residual variable indexing later, more canalized growth. Results Consistent with the `developmental origins of health and disease' hypothesis, we found relatively strong associations of tibia length-but not birth weight-with adult organ size, brain size, SMM and resting energy expenditure measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Conclusions and implications Building on prior work, these results suggest that leg length is a sensitive marker of traits directly impacting metabolic and reproductive health. Alongside findings in the same sample relating tibia length and height-residual to MRI-measured pelvic dimensions, we suggest there may exist a degree of coordination in the development of long bone, lean mass and pelvic traits, possibly centered on early, pre-pubertal growth periods. Such phenotypic coordination has important implications for fitness, serving to benefit both adult health and the health of offspring in subsequent generations. Lay Summary We provide a potential explanation for why adding centimeters to one's leg length appears to benefit the metabolic health of mothers (and fathers) and the health of offspring; namely, that favorable environmental conditions in early life support both leg growth and the development of metabolically beneficial lean mass.",leg length; lean mass; cardiometabolic risk; developmental origins of health and disease,2022,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac023,NA,9,59,278,1999,4,16,250,NA,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"Migration and descent, adaptations to altitude and tuberculosis in Nepalis and Tibetans","Background High rates of tuberculosis (TB) in migrants from Tibet and Nepal have been documented for over 120 years and were previously ascribed to poor living conditions in the places of settlement. Adaptations to altitude involving genes in the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor pathway are present in 90-95\% of Tibetans and in Nepalis these allele frequencies increase by 17\% with each 1000 m increase in altitude. Methods We calculated the incidence of TB by country of origin in immigrants from South and East Asia in New South Wales (NSW), Australia between 2004 and 2018, and compared disease severity, site of infection, evidence of local transmission and prevalence of latent TB, among these groups. Results The incidence of active TB was consistently higher among 30 000 Nepalese and 1000 Tibetans than among all other immigrants to NSW. Nepal was the only country of origin where TB incidence in immigrants was not significantly lower than the reported TB incidence in the country of origin. Conclusions and implications High rates of TB among Nepalese and Tibetan immigrants in Australia are unlikely to be attributable to pre-existing disease or local acquisition. Phenotypic effects of high-altitude adaptations may include a dampening of inflammatory responses to hypoxia, an effect unmasked by descent to a normoxic environment. A corollary of these findings may be that hypoxia-induced inflammation limits TB progression, reconfirming previous explanations for the apparent efficacy of high-altitude sanatoria. If vindicated by subsequent research, these provisional findings could open new avenues into preventive and host-directed interventions for tuberculosis. Lay Summary The incidence of tuberculosis among Nepalese immigrants to Australia and other people of Tibetan heritage who migrate to lower altitudes is very high.

EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,Coral bleaching resistance variation is linked to differential mortality and skeletal growth during recovery,"The prevalence of global coral bleaching has focused much attention on the possibility of interventions to increase heat resistance. However, if high heat resistance is linked to fitness tradeoffs that may disadvantage corals in other areas, then a more holistic view of heat resilience may be beneficial. In particular, overall resilience of a species to heat stress is likely to be the product of both resistance to heat and recovery from heat stress. Here, we investigate heat resistance and recovery among individual Acropora hyacinthus colonies in Palau. We divided corals into low, moderate, and high heat resistance categories based on the number of days (4-9) needed to reach significant pigmentation loss due to experimental heat stress. Afterward, we deployed corals back onto a reef in a common garden 6-month recovery experiment that monitored chlorophyll a, mortality, and skeletal growth. Heat resistance was negatively correlated with mortality during early recovery (0-1 month) but not late recovery (4-6 months), and chlorophyll a concentration recovered in heat-stressed corals by 1-month postbleaching. However, moderate-resistance corals had significantly greater skeletal growth than high-resistance corals by 4 months of recovery. High- and low-resistance corals on average did not exhibit skeletal growth within the observed recovery period. These data suggest complex tradeoffs may exist between coral heat resistance and recovery and highlight the importance of incorporating multiple aspects of resilience into future reef management programs.",Acropora hyacinthus; heat stress resistance and recovery; intraspecific variation; thermal resilience; tradeoffs,2023,16,"2, SI",10.1111/eva.13500,1752-4571,14,108,228,1569,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,The anthropogenic effect of land use on population genetics of Malcus inconspicuus,"Since the beginning of the Holocene era, human activities have seriously impacted animal habitats and vegetative environments. Species that are dependent on natural habitats or with narrow niches might be more severely affected by habitat changes. Malcus inconspicuus is distributed in subtropical China and highly dependent on the mountain environment. Our study investigated the role of the mountainous landscape in the historical evolution of M. inconspicuus and the impact of Holocene human activities on it. A phylogeographical approach was implemented with integrative datasets including double-digest restriction site-associated DNA (ddRAD), mitochondrial data, and distribution data. Three obvious clades and an east-west phylogeographical pattern were found in subtropical China. Mountainous landscape has ``multifaceted{''} effects on the evolutionary history of M. inconspicuus, it has contributed to population differentiation, provided glacial refuges, and provided population expansion corridors during the postglacial period. The effective population size (Ne) of M. inconspicuus showed a sharp decline during the Holocene era, which revealed a significantly negative correlation with the development of cropland in a hilly area at the same time and space. It supported that the species which are highly dependent on natural habitats might undergo greater impact when the habitat was damaged by agricultural activities and we should pay more attention to them, especially in the land development of their distribution areas.",cropland; evolutionary history; habitat loss; Malcus inconspicuus; mountain environment,2023,16,1,10.1111/eva.13512,1752-4571,12,82,215,1539,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,A diverse parasite pool can improve effectiveness of biological control constrained by genotype-by-genotype interactions,"The outcomes of biological control programs can be highly variable, with natural enemies often failing to establish or spread in pest populations. This variability has posed a major obstacle in use of the bacterial parasite Pasteuria penetrans for biological control of Meloidogyne species, economically devastating plant-parasitic nematodes for which there are limited management options. A leading hypothesis for this variability in control is that infection is successful only for specific combinations of bacterial and nematode genotypes. Under this hypothesis, failure of biological control results from the use of P. penetrans genotypes that cannot infect local Meloidogyne genotypes. We tested this hypothesis using isofemale lines of M. arenaria derived from a single field population and multiple sources of P. penetrans from the same and nearby fields. In strong support of the hypothesis, susceptibility to infection depended on the specific combination of host line and parasite source, with lines of M. arenaria varying substantially in which P. penetrans source could infect them. In light of this result, we tested whether using a diverse pool of P. penetrans could increase infection and thereby control. We found that increasing the diversity of the P. penetrans inoculum from one to eight sources more than doubled the fraction of M. arenaria individuals susceptible to infection and reduced variation in susceptibility across host lines. Together, our results highlight genotype-by-genotype specificity as an important cause of variation in biological control and call for the maintenance of genetic diversity in natural enemy populations.",coevolution; genetic diversity; genotype-by-genotype interactions; host-parasite interactions; Meloidogyne; Pasteuria,2022,15,12,10.1111/eva.13501,1752-4571,14,120,244,1658,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,Are genetic variation and demographic performance linked?,"Quantifying relationships between genetic variation and population viability is important from both basic biological and applied conservation perspectives, yet few populations have been monitored with both long-term demographic and population genetics approaches. To empirically test whether and how genetic variation and population dynamics are related, we present one such paired approach. First, we use eight years of historical demographic data from five populations of Boechera fecunda (Brassicaceae), a rare, self-compatible perennial plant endemic to Montana, USA, and use integral projection models to estimate the stochastic population growth rate (lambda(S)) and extinction risk of each population. We then combine these demographic estimates with previously published metrics of genetic variation in the same populations to test whether genetic diversity within populations is linked to demographic performance. Our results show that in this predominantly inbred species, standing genetic variation and demography are weakly positively correlated. However, the inbreeding coefficient was not strongly correlated with demographic performance, suggesting that more inbred populations are not necessarily less viable or at higher extinction risk than less inbred populations. A contemporary re-census of these populations revealed that neither genetic nor demographic parameters were consistently strong predictors of current population density, although populations showing lower probabilities of extinction in demographic models had larger population sizes at present. In the absence of evidence for inbreeding depression decreasing population viability in this species, we recommend conservation of distinct, potentially locally adapted populations of B. fecunda rather than alternatives such as translocations or reintroductions.",Boechera fecunda; conservation genetics; inbreeding depression; integral projection model; population genetics; population viability,2022,15,11,10.1111/eva.13487,1752-4571,7,57,243,1841,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,Between the Cape Fold Mountains and the deep blue sea: Comparative phylogeography of selected codistributed ectotherms reveals asynchronous cladogenesis,"We compare the phylogeographic structure of 13 codistributed ectotherms including four reptiles (a snake, a legless skink and two tortoise species) and nine invertebrates (six freshwater crabs and three velvet worm species) to test the presence of congruent evolutionary histories. Phylogenies were estimated and dated using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods with combined mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence datasets. All taxa demonstrated a marked east/west phylogeographic division, separated by the Cape Fold Mountain range. Phylogeographic concordance factors were calculated to assess the degree of evolutionary congruence among the study species and generally supported a shared pattern of diversification along the east/west longitudinal axis. Testing simultaneous divergence between the eastern and western phylogeographic regions indicated pseudocongruent evolutionary histories among the study taxa, with at least three separate divergence events throughout the Mio/Plio/Pleistocene epochs. Climatic refugia were identified for each species using climatic niche modelling, demonstrating taxon-specific responses to climatic fluctuations. Climate and the Cape Fold Mountain barrier explained the highest proportion of genetic diversity in all taxa, while climate was the most significant individual abiotic variable. This study highlights the complex interactions between the evolutionary history of fauna, the Cape Fold Mountains and past climatic oscillations during the Mio/Plio/Pleistocene. The congruent east/west phylogeographic division observed in all taxa lends support to the conclusion that the longitudinal climatic gradient within the Greater Cape Floristic Region, mediated in part by the barrier to dispersal posed by the Cape Fold Mountains, plays a major role in lineage diversification and population differentiation.",climatic fluctuations; divergence time estimation; Greater Cape Floristic Region; phylogeographic concordance; phylogeography; South Africa,2022,15,12,10.1111/eva.13493,1752-4571,19,152,247,1854,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,Comparative study of the evolution of cancer gene duplications across fish,"Comparative studies of cancer-related genes not only provide novel information about their evolution and function but also an understanding of cancer as a driving force in biological systems and species' life histories. So far, these studies have focused on mammals. Here, we provide the first comparative study of cancer-related gene copy number variation in fish. Fishes are a paraphyletic group whose last common ancestor is also an ancestor of the tetrapods, and accordingly, their tumour suppression mechanisms should include most of the mammalian mechanisms and also reveal novel (but potentially phylogenetically older) previously undetected mechanisms. We have matched the sequenced genomes of 65 fish species from the Ensemble database with the cancer gene information from the COSMIC database. By calculating the number of gene copies across species using the Ensembl CAFE data (providing species trees for gene copy number counts), we used a less resource-demanding method for homolog identification. Our analysis demonstrates a masked relationship between cancer-related gene copy number variation (CNV) and maximum lifespan in fish species, suggesting that a higher number of copies of tumour suppressor genes lengthens and the number of copies of oncogenes shortens lifespan. Based on the positive correlation between the number of copies of tumour suppressors and oncogenes, we show which species have more tumour suppressors in relation to oncogenes. It could be suggested that these species have stronger genetic defences against oncogenic processes. Fish studies could be a largely unexplored treasure trove for understanding the evolution and ecology of cancer, providing novel insights into the study of cancer and tumour suppression, in addition to fish evolution, life-history trade-offs, and ecology.",cancer defense mechanisms; cancer evolution; fish cancer; fish evolution; tumor suppression; wildlife cancer,2022,15,11,10.1111/eva.13481,1752-4571,11,74,267,1823,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,Comparison of behavioural tendencies between ``dangerous dogs{''} and other domestic dog breeds - Evolutionary context and practical implications,"Aggressive behaviour by dogs is a considerable social problem, but the ability to predict which individuals may have increased aggressive tendencies is very limited, restricting the development of efficient preventive measures. There is a common perception that certain breeds are more likely to exhibit aggressive behaviour, which has contributed to the introduction of breed-specific legislation. The rationale for such legislation explicitly assumes high heritability of this trait while also implying relatively little variation within breeds; these assumptions are largely untested. We compared behavioural tendencies between 8 breeds that are subject to legislation in at least one country and 17 breeds that are not subject to legislation using two validated psychometric tools: the Dog Impulsivity Assessment Scale (DIAS), which scores elements of impulsivity, including a tendency for aggressive behaviour, and Positive and Negative Activation Scale (PANAS), which scores sensitivity to positive and negative stimuli (which may trigger aggressive responses). We found that the two groups of breeds do not differ significantly in the specific DIAS factor relating to aggressive behaviour, ``Aggression Threshold and Response to Novelty{''}, or any other DIAS and PANAS factors. We found large variations in all behavioural tendencies measured by both psychometric scales within both groups and within each breed studied. Taken together, our findings indicate that breed alone is not a reliable predictor of individual behavioural tendencies, including those related to aggression, and therefore breed-specific legislation is unlikely to be an effective instrument for reducing risk.",aggressive behaviour; breed-specific legislation; domestic dog; evolution of behavioural traits; heritability; impulsivity,2022,15,11,10.1111/eva.13479,1752-4571,18,145,239,1690,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,Consistent variations in personality traits and their potential for genetic improvement in biocontrol agents: Trichogramma evanescens as a case study,"Improvements in the biological control of agricultural pests require improvements in the phenotyping methods used by practitioners to select efficient biological control agent (BCA) populations in industrial rearing or field conditions. Consistent inter-individual variations in behaviour (i.e. animal personality) probably affect BCA efficiency, but have never been taken into account in the development of phenotyping methods, despite having characteristics useful for phenotyping: repeatable (by definition), often heritable, etc. We developed a video-tracking method targeting animal personality traits and evaluated the feasibility of its use for genetic improvement in the BCA Trichogramma evanescens, by phenotyping 1,049 individuals from 24 isogenic lines. We found consistent individual variations in boldness, activity and exploration. Personality differences between the 24 isogenic lines suggested a genetic origin of the variations in activity and exploration (broad-sense heritability estimates of 0.06 to 0.11) and revealed a trade-off between exploration and fecundity.",animal personality; behavioural ecology; biocontrol; genetic improvement; insects; Trichogramma,2022,15,"10, SI",10.1111/eva.13329,1752-4571,20,149,143,1085,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,Delaying quantitative resistance to pesticides and antibiotics,"How can we best vary the application of pesticides and antibiotics to delay resistance evolution? Previous theoretical comparisons of deployment strategies have focused on qualitative resistance traits and have mostly assumed that resistance alleles are already present in a population. But many real resistance traits are quantitative, and the evolution of resistant genotypes in the field may depend on de novo mutation and recombination. Here, I use an individual-based, forward-time, quantitative-genetic simulation model to investigate the evolution of quantitative resistance. I evaluate the performance of four application strategies for delaying resistance evolution, to wit, the (1) sequential, (2) mosaic, (3) periodic, and (4) combined strategies. I find that which strategy is best depends on initial efficacy. When at the onset, xenobiotics completely prevent reproduction in treated demes, a combined strategy is best. On the other hand, when populations are partially resistant, the combined strategy is inferior to mosaic and periodic strategies, especially when resistance alleles are antagonistically pleiotropic. Thus, the optimal application strategy for managing against the rise of quantitative resistance depends on pleiotropy and whether or not partial resistance is already present in a population. This result appears robust to variation in pest reproductive mode and migration rate, direct fitness costs for resistant phenotypes, and the extent of refugial habitats.",antimicrobial resistance; insecticide resistance; population genetics; quantitative genetics; R-genes,2022,15,12,10.1111/eva.13497,1752-4571,7,62,211,1493,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,Evidence of hard-selective sweeps suggests independent adaptation to insecticides in Colorado potato beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) populations,"Pesticide resistance provides one of the best examples of rapid evolution to environmental change. The Colorado potato beetle (CPB) has a long and noteworthy history as a super-pest due to its ability to repeatedly develop resistance to novel insecticides and rapidly expand its geographic and host plant range. Here, we investigate regional differences in demography, recombination, and selection using whole-genome resequencing data from two highly resistant CPB populations in the United States (Hancock, Wisconsin and Long Island, New York). Demographic reconstruction corroborates historical records for a single pest origin during the colonization of the Midwestern and Eastern United States in the mid- to late-19th century and suggests that the effective population size might be higher in Long Island, NY than Hancock, WI despite contemporary potato acreage of Wisconsin being far greater. Population-based recombination maps show similar background recombination rates between these populations, as well as overlapping regions of low recombination that intersect with important metabolic detoxification genes. In both populations, we find compelling evidence for hard selective sweeps linked to insecticide resistance with multiple sweeps involving genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism, stress response, and defensive chemistry. Notably, only two candidate insecticide resistance genes are shared among both populations, but both appear to be independent hard selective sweep events. This suggests that repeated, rapid, and independent evolution of genes may underlie CPB's pest status among geographically distinct populations.",demography; insecticide resistance; pest evolution; positive selection; rapid evolution; recombination map,2022,15,"10, SI",10.1111/eva.13498,1752-4571,16,147,227,1645,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,Evolution of reproductive life-history and dispersal traits during the range expansion of a biological control agent,"Evolutionary theory predicts that the process of range expansion will lead to differences in life-history and dispersal traits between the core and edge of a population. At the edge, selection and genetic drift can have opposing effects on reproductive ability, while spatial sorting by dispersal ability can increase dispersal. However, the context that individuals experience, including population density and mating status, also impacts dispersal behavior. We seek to understand the shifts in traits of populations expanding across natural, heterogenous environments, and the evolutionary and behavioral factors that may drive those shifts. We evaluated theoretical predictions for evolution of reproductive life-history and dispersal traits using the range expansion of a biological control agent, Diorhabda carinulata, or northern tamarisk beetle. We find that individuals from the edge had increased fecundity and female body mass, and reduced age at first reproduction, indicating that genetic load is low and suggesting that selection has acted at the edge. We also find that density of conspecifics during rearing and mating status influence dispersal of males and that dispersal increases at the edge of the range under certain conditions, particularly when males were unmated and reared at low density. The restricted conditions in which dispersal has increased suggest that spatial sorting has exerted weak effects relative to other potential processes. Our results support most theoretical predictions about evolution during range expansion, even across a heterogeneous environment, especially when the ecological context is considered.",condition-dependent dispersal; Diorhabda carinulata; expansion load; spatial sorting; tethered flight mill,2022,15,12,10.1111/eva.13502,1752-4571,16,116,236,1649,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,Genomic differentiation in Pacific cod using Pool-Seq,"Patterns of genetic differentiation across the genome can provide insight into selective forces driving adaptation. We used pooled whole genome sequencing, gene annotation, and environmental covariates to evaluate patterns of genomic differentiation and to investigate mechanisms responsible for divergence among proximate Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) populations from the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands and more distant Washington Coast cod. Samples were taken from eight spawning locations, three of which were replicated to estimate consistency in allele frequency estimation. A kernel smoothing moving weighted average of relative divergence (F-ST) identified 11 genomic islands of differentiation between the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea samples. In some islands of differentiation, there was also elevated absolute divergence (d(XY)) and evidence for selection, despite proximity and potential for gene flow. Similar levels of absolute divergence (d(XY)) but roughly double the relative divergence (F-ST) were observed between the distant Bering Sea and Washington Coast samples. Islands of differentiation were much smaller than the four large inversions among Atlantic cod ecotypes. Islands of differentiation between the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island were associated with SNPs from five vision system genes, which can be associated with feeding, predator avoidance, orientation, and socialization. We hypothesize that islands of differentiation between Pacific cod from the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands provide evidence for adaptive differentiation despite gene flow in this commercially important marine species.",genomic differentiation; genomics; local adaptation; Pacific cod; Pool-Seq; selection; selection-migration balance,2022,15,11,10.1111/eva.13488,1752-4571,7,53,224,1635,7,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Aggregate Trait Evolvability and Macroevolution in Two Sister Species of the Bryozoan Stylopoma,"The study of trait evolution in modular animals is more complicated than that in solitary animals, because a single genotype of a modular colony can express an enormous range of phenotypic variation. Furthermore, traits can occur either at the module level or at the colony level. However, it is unclear how the traits at the colony level evolve. We test whether colony-level aggregate traits, defined as the summary statistics of a phenotypic distribution, can evolve. To quantify this evolutionary potential, we use parent-offspring pairs in two sister species of the bryozoan Stylopoma, grown and bred in a common garden breeding experiment. We find that the medians of phenotypic distributions are evolvable between generations of colonies. We also find that the structure of this evolutionary potential differs between these two species. Ancestral species align more closely with the direction of species divergence than the descendent species. This result indicates that aggregate trait evolvability can itself evolve.",Bryozoans; Aggregate traits; Macroevolution; Quantitative genetics; Trait variation,2023,50,1,10.1007/s11692-022-09588-8,0071-3260,13,95,155,1024,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Annual Temperatures and Dynamics of Food Availability are Associated with the Pelagic-Benthic Diversification in a Sympatric Pair of Salmonid Fish,"Fish diversification into sympatric ecomorph pairs demonstrates a striking parallelism across a number of taxa in numerous lakes. However, there is a dearth of information on environmental conditions, which may orchestrate divergence processes across generations. Here we explore whether the environmental factors affecting food and reproductive niche distinctions could trigger the divergence of the lacustrine-riverine fish species into two morphs based on kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka of the Lake Kronotskoe. We reveal drastic differences in temperature on the tributary reproduction sites affecting the early ontogeny timing and disrupting the time of lakeward migration of the morphs. The juveniles of the benthivorous morph run into the lake in spring during the food abundance peak on the slope, while the planktivorous kokanee migrates to the lake in the summer when the pelagic zone abounds with zooplankton. The dynamics of this food niches is determined by water temperature dynamics and may be stable for long periods of time, thus making each morph adapting to similar condition throughout generations. We suggest that the pelagic-benthic divergence could be explained by the factors, which are extrinsic for fish, making our results applicable for numerous cases of this microevolutionary pathway all over the Holarctic.",Abiotic factors; Food niches dynamics; Life cycle; Parallel evolution; Ecological diversification,2022,49,2,10.1007/s11692-022-09560-6,0071-3260,20,146,196,1332,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Bite Force Performance from wild Derived mice has Undetectable Heritability Despite Having Heritable Morphological Components,"Fitness-related traits tend to have low heritabilities. Conversely, morphology tends to be highly heritable. Yet, many fitness-related performance traits such as running speed or bite force depend critically on morphology. Craniofacial morphology correlates with bite performance in several groups including rodents. However, within species, this relationship is less clear, and the genetics of performance, morphology and function are rarely analyzed in combination. Here, we use a half-sib design in outbred wild-derived Mus musculus to study the morphology-bite force relationship and determine whether there is additive genetic (co-)variance for these traits. Results suggest that bite force has undetectable additive genetic variance and heritability in this sample, while morphological traits related mechanically to bite force exhibit varying levels of heritability. The most heritable traits include the length of the mandible which relates to bite force. Despite its correlation with morphology, realized bite force was not heritable, which suggests it is less responsive to selection in comparison to its morphological determinants. We explain this paradox with a non-additive, many-to-one mapping hypothesis of heritable change in complex traits. We furthermore propose that performance traits could evolve if pleiotropic relationships among the determining traits are modified.",Quantitative genetics; performance; Rodentia; geometric morphometrics; half-sib design,2022,49,4,10.1007/s11692-022-09582-0,0071-3260,15,125,191,1389,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Dimensions of Morphological Integration,"Over several generations of evolutionary and developmental biologists, ever since Olson and Miller's pioneering work of the 1950's, the concept of ``morphological integration{''} as applied to Gaussian representations N(mu, Sigma) of morphometric data has been a focus equally of methodological innovation and methodological perplexity. Reanalysis of a century-old example from Sewall Wright shows how some fallacies of distance analysis by correlations can be avoided by careful matching of the distance rosters involved to a different multivariate approach, factor analysis. I reinterpret his example by restoring the information (means and variances) ignored by the correlation matrix, while confirming what Wright called ``special size factors{''} by a different technique, inspection of the concentration matrix Sigma(-1). In geometric morphometrics (GMM), data accrue instead as Cartesian coordinates of labelled points; nevertheless, just as in the Wright example, statistical manipulations do better when they reconsider the normalizations that went into the generation of those coordinates. Here information about both mu and Sigma, the means and the variances/covariances, can be preserved via the Boas coordinates (Procrustes shape coordinates without the size adjustment) that protect the role of size per se as an essential explanatory factor while permitting the analyst to acknowledge the realities of animal anatomy and its trajectories over time or size in the course of an analysis. A descriptive quantity for this purpose is suggested, the correlation of vectorized mu against the first eigenvector of Sigma for the Boas coordinates. The paper reanalyzes two GMM data sets from this point of view. In one, the classic Vilmann rodent neurocranial growth data, a description of integration can be aligned with the purposes of evolutionary and developmental biology by a graphical exegesis based mainly in the loadings of the first Boas principal component. There results a multiplicity of morphometric patterns, some homogeneous and others characterized by gradients. In the other, a Vienna data set comprising human midsagittal skull sections mostly sampled along curves, a further integrated feature emerges, thickening of the calvaria, that requires a reparametrization and a modified thin plate spline graphic distinct from the digitized configurations per se.

EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,High-Density Three-Dimensional Morphometric Analyses Reveal Predation-Based Disparity and Evolutionary Modularity in Spider `Jaws',"Understanding complex morphological shape differences has been revolutionized by the marriage of three-dimensional morphometric techniques and micro-computed tomography scanning. In animals, a major focus of this work has been the vertebrates, particularly the axial skeleton, while shape diversity in arthropods, by comparison, is less well explored. For example, the chelicerae (fanged, jaw-like mouthpart appendages) of spiders exhibit a wide degree of variation and may be expected to differ across the diversity of spider sizes and hunting strategies (e.g., active hunters versus relying on a web to intercept and capture prey) as well as in comparison to other structures on the same organism. We characterize and quantify the shapes of the carapace and chelicerae of 40 spiders across the spider tree of life and look for differences based on how those spiders attain their prey and whether their shapes coevolved or are modular. We found evidence for differences in cheliceral shape and related structures in spiders with different predation strategies as well as evidence for both integration and modularity in those structures. This suggests different pressures on the chelicerae including but not limited to predation mode. Furthermore, while differences in the structures were observed, they still must work in concert.",Arachnid; Comparative biology; Micro-computed tomography; Morphometrics; Spider,2022,49,4,10.1007/s11692-022-09576-y,0071-3260,13,130,199,1331,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Intra- and interspecific variability of the cranial ossification sequences in Barbus sensu lato.,"Analysis of the developmental sequence variability provides data linking the ontogeny and phylogeny of the investigated objects. Here, we present a study of cranial ossifications sequence variability in the polyphyletic group of Cyprininae Barbus sensu lato (Cypriniformes, Teleostei). We analyzed the intra- and interspecific variability, compared sequences of closely related and phylogenetically distant species, reconstructed an alleged ancestral sequence, and assessed the sequence variations' evolutionary validity. As the results, we revealed that the observed sequence alterations occur due to intrinsic, likely genetic or epigenetic factors. The skull ossifications, as well as skull regions, differ in the variability level. The ossifications appearing at the intermediate phase and skull regions composing splanchnocranium are most variable. In contrast, the structures emerging at the early and late phases of skull development and regions of neurocranium are less variable. The majority of sequence alterations are non-adaptive and selectively neutral. Increase in their number accompanying the transition from intra- to interspecific and intergeneric levels resembles the accumulation of the selectively neutral genetic variations accompanying the increase of phylogenetic distance.

The comparative anatomy and morphology of claws has been studied mainly in reptiles and birds. However, as far as we know, studies focusing on turtles' claws are lacking. Turtles occupy a wide range of habitats, from aquatic to terrestrial, and vary in form and behavior, being an ideal model organism for ecomorphological studies. We performed qualitative and quantitative analyses to find a relationship between morphological variation and both ecological factors and phylogenetic constraints that could have driven the evolution of turtles' claws. The claws of 35 adult turtle and tortoise specimens of 12 species of testudines with different locomotor modes were compared. Our data show several convergence traits in claw shape, with convergence being reinforced by the low phylogenetic signal exhibited by most characters. We propose that claw morphology in turtles is mainly associated with some mechanical functions, such as freshwater-swimming, bottom-walking and tearing of prey.",Claws; Ecology; Morphology; Testudinidae,2022,49,4,10.1007/s11692-022-09580-2,0071-3260,10,55,155,1051,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Only three animal phyla-Annelida, Arthropoda and Rotifera-are known to have representatives in both psychrophilic and thermophilic habitats. Here we report species of Nematoda, Platyhelminthes and Rotifera that have independently colonized both ends of the thermal spectrum, from maritime glacier ice to geothermal hot springs in New Zealand. By phylogenetic analyses with nuclear and mitochondrial loci, we present evidence that glacial populations have deep haplotype diversity and have likely persisted throughout the Pleistocene, while residents of geothermal environments appear more contemporary.

EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,"A paradox of parasite resistance: disease-driven trophic cascades increase the cost of resistance, selecting for lower resistance with parasites than without them","Most evolutionary theory predicts that, during epidemics, hosts will evolve higher resistance to parasites that kill them. Here, we provide an alternative to that typical expectation, with an explanation centered on resource feedbacks. When resistance is costly, hosts evolve decreasing resistance without parasites, as expected. But with parasites, hosts can evolve lower resistance than they would in the absence of parasites. This outcome arises in an eco-evolutionary model when four conditions are met: first, resistance has a fecundity cost (here, via decreased foraging/exposure rate); second, resources increase during epidemics via trophic cascades; third, increased resources magnify the benefit of maintaining a fast foraging rate, thereby magnifying the cost of evolving a slower foraging/exposure rate (i.e., resistance); fourth, that amplification of the cost outweighs the benefit of resistance. When these conditions are met, hosts evolve lower resistance than without parasites. This phenomenon was previously observed in a motivating mesocosm experiment with fungal parasites, zooplankton hosts, and algal resources. Re-analyzing this experiment produced evidence for our model's mechanism. Thus, both model and experiment indicate that, via resource feedbacks, parasites can counterintuitively select against resistance.",Host-parasite interactions; Trophic cascade; Cost of resistance; Resistance evolution,2023,37,1,10.1007/s10682-022-10203-7,0269-7653,22,162,182,1339,4,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,"An evolutionary approach by second derivatives of the population growth rate of Castilleja tenuiflora, a hemiparasitic plant with and without hosts","The first partial derivatives of lambda with respect to demographic parameters quantify linear responses of population growth to vital rate perturbations, but sensitivity itself is situational and can show non-linear responses. We use the second derivative of lambda with respect to the demographic parameters to explore this type of responses in a population of a root hemiparasite (Castilleja tenuiflora). For plants growing with and without hosts, population transition matrices were built for the 2016-2018 period, and sensitivities and elasticities together with pure derivatives of the Hessian matrix were calculated, together with the second derivatives to survival and fecundity. We transformed the Hessian matrix to a logarithmic scale to avoid values with no biological meaning. Germination showed high sensitivity values, while permanence of individuals with dry aerial tissue that re-sprout had the highest elasticity. Negative values on the second derivative and on the logarithmic representation were obtained for germination with and without hosts in both years. Survival and fecundity have a similar behaviour in both conditions and periods, with negative values for survival for the first category and no negative values for fecundity. High negative values of the second derivative of the transition from seed to seedling indicate an evolutionary stable strategy and imply seeds are important to the permanence of C. tenuiflora population. A stochastic analysis of the second derivative of the transition from seed to seedling was performed with a Gamma distribution analysis, and showed negative values in all cases, corroborating this result.",Parasitic plants; Matrix models; Second derivative; Serotiny,2023,37,3,10.1007/s10682-022-10224-2,0269-7653,21,147,244,1661,4,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,"Androgens, antlers, and sexual selection: testosterone's relationship to reproductive success and associated morphological characteristics in white-tailed deer","While hormones such as testosterone are known to drive reproduction and sexually selected traits in many species, research demonstrating a relationship between testosterone and annual or overall reproductive success is sparse. We sought to directly measure how circulating testosterone relates to sexually selected characteristics and reproductive success in a freely breeding population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginanus). We captured individuals during September-March annually from 2007 to 2017 and investigated the association between testosterone and antler size, body size, and annual reproductive success for individuals. We also assessed lifetime patterns from individuals captured multiple years. We found a positive relationship between testosterone and body size, and between testosterone and antler size. However, we found a significant interaction between testosterone and age for both body size and antler size response variables, indicating that as age increases, the aforementioned positive relationships with testosterone diminish. Thus, for deer >= 6.5 years of age, testosterone is negatively related to body and antler size. In contrast, annual reproductive success, measured by number of offspring sired and recruited into the breeding population, was positively associated with antler size and body size, but not testosterone, age, or an interaction between testosterone and age. Instead, while an individual's average lifetime testosterone had no relationship with overall reproductive success, greater variation in lifetime testosterone was positively related to overall reproductive success. Thus, while we found no significant association between testosterone and annual reproductive success directly, testosterone may be indirectly related to reproductive success through its positive association with antler and body size. Furthermore, understanding how testosterone may fluctuate throughout an individual's lifetime may offer new perspectives in understanding variation in individual reproductive success.",White-tailed deer; Reproductive success; Sexual selection; Antlers; Testosterone; Androgen,2023,37,2,10.1007/s10682-022-10218-0,0269-7653,17,159,273,2044,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Experimental evidence in a poison frog model suggests that tadpole transport on the dorsum may affects warning signal effectiveness in poison frogs,"Aposematism is an anti-predator strategy where predators learn to associate the warning signal on prey with an unpleasant experience, and consequently, avoid attacking similar prey in the future. Conspicuous coloration in poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) is considered a warning signal. During parental care, parents transport their tadpoles on the dorsum, which could alter the detectability and recognition of such warning coloration by visually oriented predators. We tested this hypothesis using domestic chicks trained to avoid and discriminate between printed frog models with and without conspicuous-warning coloration. We tested whether the chicks recognized the warning coloration on printed frog models that varied in the quantity of tadpoles on the dorsum. Chicks first attacked frog models without warning coloration, whether they had tadpoles on the dorsum or not. In contrast, frog models with warning coloration were attacked last by chicks. Moreover, the frog models with warning coloration and without tadpoles experienced a lower risk of attack by chicks than similar frog models with tadpoles. However, aposematic frog models maintained the warning function of conspicuous coloration if it was located on parts of the parent's body that are not covered by the tadpoles when transported. Our results suggest that tadpoles on the dorsum of parents might compromise the effectiveness of the warning signal display in poison frogs increasing the risk of attack by visually oriented predators.",Aposematism; Parental care; Natural selection; Dendrobatidae; Tadpole transport,2023,37,2,10.1007/s10682-022-10219-z,0269-7653,22,147,222,1503,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Intraspecific variation of reproductive interference capability in Callosobruchus species,"Reproductive interference (RI) is a negative interspecific interaction caused by reproductive activities. Previous studies have implied that male-male competition increases RI capability, consisting of the male harm-inflicting capability of RI by males (RI infliction) and the female susceptibility to heterospecific male harm (RI resistance). Geographical populations show variations in the intensity of male-male competition and sexual conflict due to the influence of biotic/abiotic factors. We made two predictions: (1) RI capability would vary among conspecific populations, and (2) the degree of RI infliction by males would match that of female RI resistance in geographical strains. To test these predictions, we measured the fecundity of once-mated females in two scenarios: housed with heterospecific males and without males. We performed experiments using six strains from each of two bean weevil species, Callosobruchus maculatus and C. chinensis. The results demonstrated intraspecific variation in RI capability within both Callosobruchus species, but the RI infliction of males and RI resistance of females within a geographical strain did not consistently coincide. Our results suggest that RI varies depending on geographical strains, even within species, but we did not obtain evidence that sexual conflict molds RI capability, indicating traits driving RI do not follow the sexual conflict in both Callosobruchus species.",Bean weevils; Bruchinae; Fitness; Intraspecific variation; Longevity; Sexual conflict,2023,37,3,10.1007/s10682-022-10223-3,0269-7653,9,89,204,1440,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Selective alarm call mimicry in the sexual display of the male superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae),"Despite much research on mimicry, little is known about the ecology of dynamic mimetic signals involving mimicry of multiple species. Some of the most conspicuous examples of phenotypically plastic mimicry are produced by oscine passerines, where vocal production learning enables some species to mimic multiple models and flexibly adjust what they mimic and when. While singing from a perch, male superb lyrebirds (Menura novaehollandiae) accurately imitate multiple songs and calls of over 20 species of bird. However, at key moments within their multimodal displays performed on display arenas on the forest floor, males mimic a small number of mobbing-alarm calls creating the acoustic illusion of a mixed-species mobbing flock ('D-song'). Using observations from camera footage and a field-based playback experiment, we tested six hypotheses for alarm call model selection within D-song. Mimicked species were remarkably invariant, with 79\% of D-song made up of imitations of just three different bird species. Males did not mimic the most common species in their general environment, but neither did they mimic rare species. Instead, males imitated the mobbing-alarm calls of heterospecific birds that foraged on or near the forest floor. Indeed, males primarily mimicked the alarm calls of heterospecific species that foraged alongside lyrebirds and were likely to appear together in experimentally-induced, terrestrial mobbing flocks. These findings support the hypothesis that males mimic a cue of a terrestrial predatory threat to lyrebirds, most likely to exploit the antipredator behaviour of female lyrebirds. Our study illustrates the importance of investigating the drivers of model selection in dynamic multi-model mimicry.",Alarm calls; Birdsong; Copulation calls; Mimicry; Model selection; Vocal learning,2023,37,2,10.1007/s10682-022-10200-w,0269-7653,15,103,254,1740,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Spatial differentiation of background matching strategies along a Late Pleistocene range expansion route,"Late Pleistocene climate changes have deeply impacted the range dynamics of temperate species. While the genetic legacy of these dynamics has been widely investigated, little is known about their phenotypic consequences. Anti-predatory strategies offer intriguing opportunities to study phenotypic evolution in response to dispersal dynamics since the ability to avoid predation can be pivotal for populations colonising new environments. Here we investigated the spatial differentiation of background colour matching strategies along a Late Pleistocene range expansion route of a temperate species, the Tyrrhenian tree frog Hyla sarda. Using common-garden experiments, we tested whether individuals from the source area (Sardinia) and individuals from the newly founded area (Corsica) differ in two components of the camouflage strategy: colour change abilities and background choice behaviour. We found a remarkable spatial structure in both colour change abilities and background choice behaviour, across the expansion range. Tree frogs from the source area displayed higher colour change abilities and a more pronounced preference for a greener background, with respect to tree frogs from the newly colonised area. Our results support the intriguing hypothesis that Late Pleistocene biogeographic history might be an overlooked major player in shaping current spatial patterns of phenotypic traits variation across animal populations.",Animal camouflage; Phenotypic evolution; Quaternary range expansion; Island biogeography; Hyla sarda,2023,37,2,10.1007/s10682-022-10216-2,0269-7653,13,104,200,1438,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,The scale of competition impacts parasite virulence evolution,"The structure of parasite populations can have important consequences for virulence evolution. Both the scale of competition, whether it is more intense in the within versus between host environment, and the mode of transmission, whether parasites transmit alone or in groups between hosts, influence population structure and can select for changes in virulence. In a selection experiment, we evolved metapopulations of the spider mite parasite Tetranychus urticae, under local (fixed sampling per host patch) or global (sampling determined by host patch productivity) competition, with either co- (with a female parasite from the same host patch) or random (with parasites from different host patches) transmission. After 33 generations of evolution, the fecundity and virulence of each replicate population was measured. Females from the `local-random' regime were more virulent with higher fecundity than females from the `global-random' regime. There was no difference in virulence or fecundity between females from the `global-random' or `global co-transmission' selection regimes. These results show that the scale of competition, and not the type of transmission, impacted virulence evolution for T. urticae. Local competition may maintain higher levels of genetic diversity at the level of the metapopulation. As such, intense local, within-host, competition selected for more productive individuals better able to exploit their environment and be the one to transmit to a new host.",Hard selection; Soft selection; Budding dispersal; Tetranychus urticae; Co-transmission; Experimental evolution,2023,37,1,10.1007/s10682-022-10199-0,0269-7653,8,61,216,1490,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Urban-rural gradients: how landscape changes drive adaptive evolution of plant competitive traits,"The role of competition in local adaptation and the associated traits underlying adaptation remain unclear. One reason for the lack of evidence may be that plant-plant competition is ubiquitous in natural environments; thus, local adaptation to different levels of competition is difficult to test. Comparison between urban and rural habitats is suitable for examining the evolutionary impacts of competition because these habitats share several plant species, but differ greatly in plant density and their resulting degree of competition. Here, using methods of landscape ecology, we propose a landscape evolutionary ecological approach-a simple analytical framework-to investigate how landscape changes in urban-rural gradients drive the local adaptation of competitive traits. We demonstrated adaptive divergence of competitive traits (i.e. growth habits) between urban and rural populations in two Poaceae plants (Digitaria ciliaris and Eleusine indica) and summarised the experimental procedure to examine local adaptation to different levels of competitive environments. Landscape change due to urbanisation provides an opportunity to understand the drivers and constraints of the evolution of plant competitive traits.

EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Why do some funneliform flowers have petal folds accompanied with hierarchical surface microstructure?,"Plant surface microstructure and its ultrastructural cuticular patterns, especially of the petal surface, is diverse in nature, and has associated diverse biological functions. These microstructures can be primary as well as secondary, i.e. hierarchical in development. Since the discovery of these structures over a century ago, many functional aspects about them, including biological, chemical, and physical, have been constantly redefined over the years. Funneliform flowers, an example of synorganization in corolla, are known to be a derived trait in angiosperms. As for pollinator interaction, gamopetalous corolla is a definite advantage because it provides a sturdy seat or a sturdy receptacle for the pollinator depending on the type of pollinator. Petal folds likewise play a role in increasing the total size of the interacting surface of the petal with the pollinator without losing compactness in the bargain. We illustrate that petal folds have multiple evolutionary occurrences in Acanthaceae as well as in Asterids and therefore provide a strong reason for their functional association with the corresponding types of floral forms. We present observations on petal folds and their surface microstructure in two Ruellia species studied, and note that the microstructure differs in different regions containing petal folds-denser on out-folds compared to the in-folds-throughout the throat of the funneliform corolla. We then discuss: (a) how these secondary microstructures differentiating in the two types of folds could be associated with varied functional aspects, and (b) what might be governing this differential development of cuticular secondary microstructure, through some hypotheses.",Cuticular nano-ridges; Petal folds; Petal ultrastructure or hierarchical structure; Funneliform flowers; Acanthaceae; Ruellia,2023,37,2,10.1007/s10682-022-10217-1,0269-7653,13,102,246,1709,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Aggressive behaviour in the skyhoppers of the Australian Alps,"The evolution of male-male aggression is of interest because at its extreme it can be very energetically costly, leave males vulnerable to preadtors, and give rise to weaponry such as exaggerated traits. In grasshoppers (Acrididae), one group stands out as exceptionally aggressive, the skyhoppers (Kosciuscola) in which males bite, kick, mandible flare, and wrestle each other for access to females or when females are laying eggs. In this study we asked whether there is variation in aggressive behaviour among four skyhopper species and aimed to determine whether the traits used in fighting bear signatures of sexual selection in their size, variability, and allometric scaling. We found clear differences in the numbers and types of aggressive behaviours among species. Kosciuscola tristis and K. usitatus were the most aggressive, K. cognatus was the least aggressive, and K. tristis was the only species that performed the `mandible flare' behaviour. Mandible size was larger among the three species that showed aggressive behaviour, all except K. cognatus, and was negatively allometric for all species possibly suggesting a functional size constraint. Pronotum size was different among most species and K. tristis' pronotum was the largest and borderline positively allometric perhaps suggesting that pronotum size is related to aggressive behaviour but the nature of that relationship remains obscured. Our study suggests that further work investigates skyhoppers' aggressive behaviour and how it varies with ecology, and paves the way for establishing them as a model system in the evolution of aggressive behaviour.",Orthoptera; Fighting; Combat; Elevation; Mountain; Allometry,2022,36,"4, SI",10.1007/s10682-022-10185-6,0269-7653,9,61,244,1627,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Analysis of the leaf metabolome in Arabidopsis thaliana mutation accumulation lines reveals association of metabolic disruption and fitness consequence,"Understanding the mechanisms by which mutations affect fitness and the distribution of mutational effects are central goals in evolutionary biology. Mutation accumulation (MA) lines have long been an important tool for understanding the effect of new mutations on fitness, phenotypic variation, and mutational parameters. However, there is a clear gap in predicting the effect of specific new mutations to their effects on fitness. In an attempt to directly connect the effect of spontaneous mutations to their fitness effects, we quantified the metabolic expression of 386 known compounds in primary and secondary metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana MA lines that had consistently higher and lower relative fitness than the progenitor. The high and low fitness lines do not have a difference in the average number of mutations and share the same types of metabolic pathways disrupted. However, compared to the progenitor, low fitness lines have significantly more metabolic subpathways disrupted than lines with higher fitness. These results suggest that the effect of a new mutation on fitness depends less on the specific metabolic pathways disrupted and potentially more on the number of disrupted pathways. We fail to identify any direct connection of mutations in or near well annotated genes to their effect on well-characterized biochemical pathways, possibly due to incomplete annotations of molecular function or to non-genetic variation controlling metabolic expression. Our findings indicate that organisms can explore a considerable amount of physiological space with only a few mutations.",Mutation accumulation; Spontaneous mutations; Metabolomics,2022,36,5,10.1007/s10682-022-10210-8,0269-7653,19,151,237,1601,3,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Do common dispersal influences inform a large lizard's landscape-scale gene flow?,"The dispersal tendencies of individuals can provide an important adaptive basis to counter environmental and ecological variation to increase fitness and benefit populations. We evaluated whether indirect genetic-based measures of dispersal of a large monitor lizard (Varanus varius) were sex-biased and further covaried with putative demographic and ecological differences across a forest ecotone in Southern Australia. The mean corrected assignment index (i.e., mAI(C)) estimated that lace monitors had significant male-biased dispersal. There was strong evidence that common dispersal promoting influences, including lace monitor density and arboreal mammal prey availability, but not the overall male-biased sex ratio, differed with forest type across the ecotone. These different forest types influenced the extent of sex-biased dispersal, with lace monitors captured in banksia woodland having a significant male bias in dispersal, whilst lace monitors sampled in adjacent eucalypt forest showed no difference in assignment values indicating no sex-biased dispersal. However, individual-based spatial autocorrelation analyses and mixed effect models indicated no spatial mediated genetic structuring nor evidence of sex or habitat-related effects. Estimates of recent migration (i.e., < 3 generations) indicated strong and symmetrical migration between banksia woodland and eucalypt forest patches suggesting limited habitat resistance to gene flow across an ecotonal landscape. Not discounting method-specific evidence for male- and forest-type-biased dispersal, the absence of spatial genetic structuring suggests lace monitors retain a high dispersal capacity. An absence of landscape-scale genetic structure is consistent with this species's high vagility. This landscape-scale result is further supported because only the most significant biogeographic barriers (e.g., mountain ranges) impede gene flow within the species' extensive range distribution, allowing for genetic structuring among populations.",Adaptive dispersal; Gene flow; Geographic structuring; Reptile; Landscape resource gradients; Ecotone; Varanus varius,2022,36,6,10.1007/s10682-022-10208-2,0269-7653,11,81,265,2015,7,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
FIRE ECOLOGY,"Fire history and vegetation data reveal ecological benefits of recent mixed-severity fires in the Cumberland Mountains, West Virginia, USA","Background Without periodic fire, fire-adapted plant communities across the Central Hardwood Forest Region (CHF) in the USA have undergone significant changes in forest structure and species composition, most notably a decrease in oak regeneration and herbaceous diversity and an increase in shade-tolerant, fire-sensitive tree species. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of two mixed pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus) forests with different land management histories in the Cumberland Mountains of southern West Virginia where fire ecology and fire effects are understudied. We reconstructed the fire history of both sites from fire-scarred shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) and pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.) trees to describe variation in the fire regimes over time. We also made plant community measurements that spatially coincided with fire-scarred pines to assess present-day plant community structure in relation to recent fire history. Results Before 1970, fires at Hite Fork and Wall Fork occurred frequently and almost exclusively in the dormant season, every 7-8 years on average. The fire regimes diverged in the Post-Industrial era (1970-2020), during which there was a single fire at Wall Fork, while six major fires, scarring more than 40\% of sampled trees, occurred between 1985 and 2017 at Hite Fork. Four of these dormant-season fires correspond to late fall incendiary fires in the observational record. These differences in recent fire history had large effects on plant community structure. Recent mixed-severity fires at Hite Fork likely caused mortality of pole-sized trees and opened the canopy, creating conditions favorable for pine recruitment and resulted in significantly higher species richness in the herbaceous layer compared to Wall Fork, which exhibited the effects of mesophication. Conclusions Our results suggest that frequent mixed-severity fire in pine-oak forests of the Cumberland Mountains can meet management objectives by reducing mesophytic tree abundance, increasing herbaceous diversity and pine recruitment, and generally promoting forest heterogeneity.",Fire effects; Fire history; Mesophication; Oak forests; Pitch pine; Shortleaf pine,2022,18,1,10.1186/s42408-022-00143-6,1933-9747,19,138,303,2115,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
FIRE ECOLOGY,"Microenvironment characteristics and early regeneration after the 2018 Spring Creek Wildfire and post-fire logging in Colorado, USA","Background Wildfires are increasing in size and severity in forests of the western USA, driven by climate change and land management practices during the 20th century. Altered fire regimes have resulted in a greater need for knowledge on best practices for managing burned landscapes, especially in instances where a return to a previous forested ecosystem is desired. We examined a large wildfire from 2018 in southern Colorado to understand how fire severity and post-fire logging influenced stand structure, fuels, vegetation, and soil microsite conditions. Results Two years post-fire and 1 year post logging, there was no difference in understory vegetation response. Logged plots demonstrated lower daily average temperature and minimum soil moisture and higher fuel loading across most fuel size classes relative to unlogged plots, which also corresponded with a loss of dead standing wood and little to no canopy cover. Early post-fire conifer regeneration was low across all plots, but lower soil moisture and higher soil temperature negatively impacted the density of regeneration. Conclusions Successful tree regeneration is mediated by multiple factors from the microsite to landscape scale. Here, we demonstrate the importance of those microsite conditions such as soil moisture and temperature in predicting conifer tree establishment in the early post-fire period. Careful consideration of soil impacts and the associated changes to forest conditions should be taken when conducting post-fire logging to prevent detrimental effects on microsite conditions and forest recovery.",Salvage logging; Post-fire logging; Post-wildfire recovery; Tree regeneration,2022,18,1,10.1186/s42408-022-00133-8,1933-9747,17,131,233,1591,4,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
FIRE ECOLOGY,"Pre-Columbian red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) fire regimes of north-central Pennsylvania, USA","Background Fire-dependent vegetation communities in the northeastern USA have undergone significant transitions since social and ecological disruptions associated with Euro-American colonization of North America. There is much interest, though little information available, about historical fire regimes of fire-adapted vegetation communities in the northeastern USA in pre-Columbian times (i.e., pre-1492 CE). We intensively investigated a red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.)-oak (Quercus spp.) forested landscape in north-central Pennsylvania, USA, for exceptionally old red pine remnants (stumps, snags) where previous research had suggested the potential to develop fire-scar and tree-ring chronologies which extend to time periods prior to 1492. Results Tree-ring and fire-scar chronologies recovered from red pine trees extend back to 1370 and 1402, respectively. Red pine trees were broadly distributed across this landscape (34.4 km(2) area) prior to 1492, and frequent fire (i.e., mean fire return intervals of 4.1 years at landscape scale, 9.7-11.7 years at smaller spatial scales (0.5-7.1 km(2))) was observed in the time period prior to sustained contact between Indigenous peoples and Euro-American colonizers circa 1609. Conclusions This study resulted in the longest fire-scar record in eastern North America and offers unique foundational ecological information regarding pre-Columbian fire regimes of northeastern USA fire-adapted forest communities. Fire scars provide physical evidence that fire was an important ecological component of this landscape before and after 1492 and that the current period of reduced fire activity is unprecedented in the 500 years prior to fire exclusion practices that were widely adopted circa 1915. Beyond fire scars, the spatial and temporal extent of the red pine tree-ring record provides evidence that red pine, a fire-dependent species, was historically a more important component of this landscape than it is today.

FIRE ECOLOGY,Short-term benefits of prescribed fire to bird communities of dry forests,"Background Low-severity prescribed fire is an important tool to manage fire-maintained forests across North America. In dry conifer forests of the western USA, prescribed fire is often used to reduce fuel loads in forests characterized historically by mixed- and low-severity fire regimes. Understanding the ecological effects of prescribed fire treatments is important for predicting the impacts of these management actions on wildlife communities. Few studies, however, have estimated small landbird responses to forest treatments at spatial scales relevant to their ecology or have examined potential differences in treatment effects applied within historically mixed- vs. low-severity fire regimes. Therefore, we evaluated prescribed fire treatment effects and relationships with burn severity for avian communities in dry conifer forests dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) located on seven national forests in the interior western USA. We surveyed birds for 1-4 years and 1-3 years before and after prescribed fire treatments at mixed- and low-severity fire regime locations, respectively, following a before-after, control-impact study design - 8 paired control-treatment units in mixed-severity locations (16 total study units with 320 survey points) and 4 paired control-treatment units in low-severity locations (10 total study units with 278 survey points). Using a Bayesian hierarchical multi-species occupancy model, we investigated responses to prescribed fire treatments by a community of 95 bird species. Results We found statistically supported treatment effects and/or burn severity relationships for 33 species primarily in mixed-severity locations. The data supported positive treatment effects at mixed-severity locations for 9 species (American robin {[}Turdus migratorius], western bluebird [}Sialia mexicana], hairy woodpecker {[}Dryobates villosus], black-backed woodpecker {[}Picoides arcticus], American three-toed woodpecker {[}Picoides dorsalis], house wren {[}Troglodytes aedon], dusky flycatcher {[}Empidonax oberholseri], western wood-pewee [}Contopus sordidulus], gray flycatcher {[}Empidonax wrightii]), whose occupancy was more likely after treatment at the most severely burned units, and a negative effect for one species (ruby-crowned kinglet [}Corthylio calendula]), whose occupancy was less likely after treatment at the most severely burned units. At low-severity locations, only two species exhibited treatment effects, both negative (red-faced warbler {[}Cardellina rubrifrons] and lark sparrow {[}Chondestes grammacus]). We also found supported occupancy relationships with burn severity post-treatment (i.e., regardless of species distribution before treatment) for 29 species, most of which were consistent with their life histories (e.g., patterns of positive relationships for cavity-nesting, bark insectivores and negative relationships for open-nesting, foliage insectivores). Stronger responses to prescribed fire treatments at mixed-severity locations were unexpected because prescribed fire applications were more similar to historical wildfires characteristic of low-severity fire regimes. Conclusions Bird populations in historically low-severity locations may be relatively unresponsive to prescribed fire because fire there is typically more frequent and regular. By comparison, fire events in forests characterized by a mixed-severity regime are less common, potentially eliciting more responses to an infrequent opportunity, even by species that are strongly associated with recently burned forests by wildfire. Our results suggest that fire management activities intended to reduce fuels and lower the risk of high-severity wildfire can also be effective in creating habitat for some fire specialists at least in the short term.",BACI; Birds; Dry conifer forests; Fuel treatments; Prescribed fire; Point count survey; Hierarchical Bayes; Presence-absence data; Ponderosa pine,2022,18,1,10.1186/s42408-022-00130-x,1933-9747,11,73,502,3798,9,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,yes,no,yes
FIRE ECOLOGY,Effects of repeated fire on Florida oak-saw palmetto scrub,"Background The dominant species of Florida oak-saw palmetto scrub sprout after burning from belowground rhizomes or fire-resistant aboveground buds with rapid reestablishment of cover. Responses to single fires are well documented; however, responses to repeated fires may differ. Fire return intervals, differences among sites, and species may influence responses. We used transect data from four sites on Kennedy Space Center/Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge to test whether growth differed through repeated fires. Two sites burned five times in 36 years, one site burned five times in 25 years, and one burned four times in 18 years. We used linear mixed models that account for repeated measures to determine if the number of fires affected height, total cover >= 0.5 m and < 0.5 m, bare ground, and cover of the dominant oak (Quercus) >= 0.5 m and of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) >= 0.5 m. We compared community composition through repeated fires using nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination. Results Height, total cover >= 0.5 m, and cover of the dominant oak >= 0.5 m and of saw palmetto >= 0.5 m increased with time since burn; total cover < 0.5 m and bare ground decreased. A quadratic term in the growth model was significant except for total cover < 0.5 m. There were site differences for all variables except bare ground. The number of fires decreased height, total cover >= 0.5 m, and cover of the dominant oak >= 0.5 and increased total cover < 0.5 m and bare ground but had no effect on cover of Serenoa repens >= 0.5 m. Community changes after repeated fires were similar in nonmetric multidimensional ordinations with time since burn correlated to the first or second axis. Conclusions Scrub recovered from repeated fires at a range of intervals and seasons, but short return intervals reduced growth with responses differing among species.",Florida; Oak-saw palmetto scrub; Quercus; Repeated fire; Serenoa,2022,18,1,10.1186/s42408-022-00140-9,1933-9747,9,58,307,1872,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
FIRE ECOLOGY,Decoupling between soil moisture and biomass drives seasonal variations in live fuel moisture across co-occurring plant functional types,"Background Wildfires are important global disturbances influencing ecosystem structure and composition. The moisture content of living and senescent plant components are key determinants of wildfire activity, yet our understanding of how seasonal fluctuations in water availability and biomass control live foliar moisture content (LFMC) across co-occurring plant functional types is limited in diverse forested landscapes. Results We recorded root-zone volumetric water content (VWC) and sampled leaf mass area (LMA) and LFMC of three co-occurring plant functional types across six field sites. We used a linear mixed effects model to quantify the drivers of LFMC and understand whether LFMC dynamics were coupled or decoupled from site conditions. Both LMA and VWC were significant predictors of LFMC variability (p < 0.001), although the strength and direction of these relationships varied across functional types. LFMC dynamics of understorey plant functional types were strongly coupled to site conditions, where the site random effect explained 44.2\% (shrub) and 74.8\% (herb) of the variability in LFMC across the season respectively. In contrast, overstorey plants were decoupled from site conditions, which explained only 8.1\% of the variability in LFMC. Conclusions LFMC of understorey plants responded to changes in soil water availability (VWC), while overstorey trees responded to biomass fluctuations (LMA). We present a conceptual model describing the influence of these factors on LFMC, which aligns with our findings and draws on the broader literature. This knowledge and conceptual approach can be used to improve our ability to characterize seasonal LFMC variation across different plant functional types, in turn improving our capacity to predict wildfire risk.",Fuel moisture; Functional type; Leaf mass area (LMA); Live foliar moisture content (LFMC); Soil moisture,2022,18,1,10.1186/s42408-022-00136-5,1933-9747,18,136,258,1785,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
FIRE ECOLOGY,Modeled interactions of mountain pine beetle and wildland fire under future climate and management scenarios for three western US landscapes,"Background Mountain pine beetle (MPB) is a native disturbance agent across most pine forests in the western US. Climate changes will directly and indirectly impact frequencies and severities of MPB outbreaks, which can then alter fuel characteristics and wildland fire dynamics via changes in stand structure and composition. To investigate the importance of MPB to past and future landscape dynamics, we used the mechanistic, spatially explicit ecosystem process model FireBGCv2 to quantify interactions among climate, MPB, wildfire, fire suppression, and fuel management under historical and projected future climates for three western US landscapes. We compared simulated FireBGCv2 output from three MPB modules (none, simple empirical, and complex mechanistic) using three focus variables and six exploratory variables to evaluate the importance of MPB to landscape dynamics. Results We found that inclusion of MPB (empirical or mechanistic) in the simulations significantly changed past and future landscape dynamics and that the mechanistic MPB module had more cross-scale interactions that increased variability, and perhaps realism, of simulation results. We also evaluated impacts of fire and fuel management on MPB dynamics and found that fire suppression influenced fuel loadings more than MPB disturbance, but at a landscape scale, most fuel treatment programs did little to change fuel loadings, MPB dynamics, and burned area, except under high fire suppression. Conclusions Synergistic interactions of climate, MPB, and wildfire catalyzed landscape-scale changes in vegetation distributions, fuels, and fire regimes in FireBGCv2 simulations. Models that simulate climate change on pine-dominated landscapes may be improved by including mechanistic MPB simulations to account for potentially important ecological interactions.",Landscape modeling; Disturbance ecology; Climate change; Fuel treatments; Fire suppression; Mountain pine beetle,2022,18,1,10.1186/s42408-022-00137-4,1933-9747,20,140,257,1839,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
FIRE ECOLOGY,"Contradictions and continuities: a historical context to Euro-American settlement era fires of the Lake States, USA","Background The Lake States experienced unprecedented land use changes during Euro-American settlement including large, destructive fires. Forest changes were radical in this region and largely attributed to anomalous settlement era fires in slash (cumulation of tops and branches) following cutover logging. In this study, I place settlement era fires in a historical context by examining fire scar data in comparison to historical accounts and investigate fire-vegetation-climate relationships within a 400-year context. Results Settlement era fires (1851-1947) were less frequent than pre-settlement fires (1548-1850) with little evidence that slash impacted fire frequency or occurrence at site or ecoregion scales. Only one out of 25 sites had more frequent settlement era fires, and that site was a pine forest that had never been harvested. Settlement era fires were similar across disparate ecoregions and forest types including areas with very different land use history. Settlement fires tended to burn during significantly dry periods, the same conditions driving large fires for the past 400 years. The burned area in the October 8, 1871, Peshtigo Fire was comprised of mesic forests where fuels were always abundant and high-severity fires would be expected under the drought conditions in 1871. Furthermore, slash would not have been a major contributor to fire behavior or effects in the Peshtigo Fire when logging was still limited to relatively accessible pine forests. Conclusions Historical written accounts of fires and settlement era survey records provide a reference point for landscape changes but lack temporal depth to understand forest dynamics. Tree-ring analyses provide a longer (ca. 400 year) context and more mechanistic understanding of landscape dynamics. While settlement land use changes of Lake States forests were pervasive, fires were not the ultimate degrading factor, but rather likely one of the few natural processes still at work.",Cutover; Dendrochronology; Fire history; Michigan; Peshtigo fire; Pinus resinosa; Red pine; Slash; Wildfire; Wisconsin,2022,18,1,10.1186/s42408-022-00127-6,1933-9747,16,115,293,1973,10,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
FIRE ECOLOGY,A spatially explicit analytical framework to assess wildfire risks on brown bear habitat and corridors in conservation areas,"Background Humans have altered fire regimes across ecosystems due to climate change, land use change, and increasing ignition. Unprecedented shifts in fire regimes affect animals and contribute to habitat displacement, reduced movement, and increased mortality risk. Mitigating these effects require the identification of habitats that are susceptible to wildfires. We designed an analytical framework that incorporates fire risk mapping with species distribution modeling to identify key habitats of Ursus arctos with high probability of fire in Iran. We applied the random forest algorithm for fire risk mapping. We also modeled brown bear habitats and predicted connectivity between them using species distribution models and connectivity analysis, respectively. Finally, the fire risk map, critical habitats, and corridors were overlaid to spatially identify habitats and corridors that are at high risk of fire. Results We identified 17 critical habitats with 5245 km(2) of corridors connecting them, 40.06\% and 11.34\% of which are covered by conservation areas, respectively. Our analysis showed that 35.65\% of key habitats and 23.56\% of corridors are at high risk of fire. Conclusions Since bears habitat in this semi-arid landscape rely on forests at higher altitudes, it is likely that shifting fire regimes due to changing climate and land use modifications reduce the extent of habitats in the future. While it is not well known how fire affects bears, identifying its key habitat where wildfires are likely to occur is the first step to manage potential impacts from increasing wildfires on this species.",Biodiversity conservation; Conservation area; Disturbance ecology; Fire ecology; Fire risk mapping; Risk assessment; Species distribution model; Ursus arctos,2022,18,1,10.1186/s42408-021-00125-0,1933-9747,18,124,243,1620,8,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
FIRE ECOLOGY,Multitemporal lidar captures heterogeneity in fuel loads and consumption on the Kaibab Plateau,"Background Characterization of physical fuel distributions across heterogeneous landscapes is needed to understand fire behavior, account for smoke emissions, and manage for ecosystem resilience. Remote sensing measurements at various scales inform fuel maps for improved fire and smoke models. Airborne lidar that directly senses variation in vegetation height and density has proven to be especially useful for landscape-scale fuel load and consumption mapping. Here we predicted field-observed fuel loads from airborne lidar and Landsat-derived fire history metrics with random forest (RF) modeling. RF models were then applied across multiple lidar acquisitions (years 2012, 2019, 2020) to create fuel maps across our study area on the Kaibab Plateau in northern Arizona, USA. We estimated consumption across the 2019 Castle and Ikes Fires by subtracting 2020 fuel load maps from 2019 fuel load maps and examined the relationship between mapped surface fuels and years since fire, as recorded in the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) database. Results R-squared correlations between predicted and ground-observed fuels were 50, 39, 59, and 48\% for available canopy fuel, 1- to 1000-h fuels, litter and duff, and total surface fuel (sum of 1- to 1000-h, litter and duff fuels), respectively. Lidar metrics describing overstory distribution and density, understory density, Landsat fire history metrics, and elevation were important predictors. Mapped surface fuel loads were positively and nonlinearly related to time since fire, with asymptotes to stable fuel loads at 10-15 years post fire. Surface fuel consumption averaged 16.1 and 14.0 Mg ha(- 1) for the Castle and Ikes Fires, respectively, and was positively correlated with the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). We estimated surface fuel consumption to be 125.3 +/- 54.6 Gg for the Castle Fire and 27.6 +/- 12.0 Gg for the portion of the Ikes Fire (42\%) where pre- and post-fire airborne lidar were available. Conclusions We demonstrated and reinforced that canopy and surface fuels can be predicted and mapped with moderate accuracy using airborne lidar data. Landsat-derived fire history helped account for spatial and temporal variation in surface fuel loads and allowed us to describe temporal trends in surface fuel loads. Our fuel load and consumption maps and methods have utility for land managers and researchers who need landscape-wide estimates of fuel loads and emissions. Fuel load maps based on active remote sensing can be used to inform fuel management decisions and assess fuel structure goals, thereby promoting ecosystem resilience. Multitemporal lidar-based consumption estimates can inform emissions estimates and provide independent validation of conventional fire emission inventories. Our methods also provide a remote sensing framework that could be applied in other areas where airborne lidar is available for quantifying relationships between fuels and time since fire across landscapes.",Forest fuels; Canopy fuels; Surface fuels; Fuel mapping; Fuel consumption; Post-fire fuel dynamics; Remote sensing; Airborne lidar,2022,18,1,10.1186/s42408-022-00142-7,1933-9747,13,94,444,2993,8,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,yes,no,yes
FIRE-SWITZERLAND,Topographic Factors Drive Short-Term Understory Revegetation in Burned Areas,"Fire is a disturbance factor in forest ecosystems which has an important influence on vegetation succession. In order to reveal the natural recovery characteristics of the understory vegetation and its response to topographic factors (elevation, slope position, aspect and slope) after fire in subtropical forests, a typical subtropical forest (Xide County, China) was selected as the study area. Based on quadrat surveys and correlation analyses, the main results of this study were as follows. (1) Within four months after a fire, a total of 71 species, 52 genera and 20 families of understory vegetation species were increased, representing a rapid recovery after a fire. The total number of genera and species of understory vegetation increased by 157\% and 209\%, respectively. (2) Different burning intensities had different effects on the recovery of vegetation species diversity. The change in Margalef richness index was the most significant, increasing by 5.44 and 5.16 in lightly and severely burned areas, respectively. (3) The vegetation community could be divided into six types after restoration. (4) Elevation and slope were significantly correlated with the diversity and distribution characteristics of understory vegetation in the burned area.

FIRE-SWITZERLAND,Study on Membrane Damage and Collapse of Air-Supported Structures under Fire Conditions,"Air-supported structures are widely used as public buildings. Air-supported structures are soft and most traditional fire-fighting installations cannot be used in them. Existing design specifications only specify the fire resistance of the materials to be used for air-supported structures and there is no fire resistance design method for air-supported structures. The destruction process of air-supported structures can be divided into three stages: pre-fracture, leakage, and collapse. Theorical and numerical models were used to research the time span of all those stages. A framework to estimate the collapse and evacuation time was proposed in this paper. Air-supported structures with different spans were researched in this paper, and we found that the height of a structure has a significant influence on its fire resistance. The evacuation time increased by more than 52 times when the structure's span increased from 20 m to 80 m. The pre-fracture stage contributed to more than 90\% of the evacuation time when the span of structure was larger than 80 m.",air-supported structures; fire condition; weld joint; collapse,2022,5,5,10.3390/fire5050162,2571-6255,12,87,164,1066,4,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,no,yes,yes
FIRE-SWITZERLAND,"Assessment and Mitigation of the Fire Vulnerability and Risk in the Historic City Centre of Aveiro, Portugal","Identifying fire risk in urban centres is instrumental for supporting informed decision-making and outlining efficient vulnerability mitigation strategies. Historic centres are particularly complex in this regard due to the high density of combustible materials in these areas, the favourable fire propagation conditions between buildings, and the complex urban morphology, which makes the evacuation of inhabitants difficult in case of a fire emergency. Recent safety regulations tend not to be fully applicable to historic city centres, where the specificities of the buildings, together with the need to safeguard their heritage value, make the rules for new buildings incompatible. For that reason, an adaptation of current evaluation methods is required to assure the safety of these places. The present paper aims to contribute to this topic by presenting and discussing the results obtained from the application of a simplified fire risk assessment methodology to a representative part of the historic city centre of Aveiro, Portugal. Data were collected through fieldwork building inspections and the results were mapped using a Geographic Information System tool. The study reveals that around 63\% of the assessed buildings have a level of fire risk greater than the level of risk which is acceptable for buildings with this type of use and value. Based on the work developed, different mitigation strategies are suggested and compared.

FIRE-SWITZERLAND,Numerical Investigations on the Influencing Factors of Rapid Fire Spread of Flammable Cladding in a High-Rise Building,"This paper investigates aluminium composite panels (ACPs) to understand the fire behaviour of combustible cladding systems under different fire scenarios. A fire dynamics simulator (FDS) is used to develop the numerical model of full-scale fire tests of combustible cladding systems using the procedures of the British BS 8414.1 standards. The results obtained from the FDS models are verified with test data. Seven test scenarios are investigated with four distinct parameters, i.e., cavity barrier, air-cavity gap, panel mounting (with and without joining gaps between the panels), and material combustibility qualities. A critical air-cavity gap (50-100 mm) is established at which maximum fire spread is noticed. Furthermore, variations in the cavity barrier, panel mounting, and material combustibility significantly impact the rapid fire spread of ACP cladding systems and the internal failure criterion.

FIRE-SWITZERLAND,Wildfire Risk in the Complex Terrain of the Santa Barbara Wildland-Urban Interface during Extreme Winds,"Each year, wildfires ravage the western U.S. and change the lives of millions of inhabitants. Situated in southern California, coastal Santa Barbara has witnessed devastating wildfires in the past decade, with nearly all ignitions started by humans. Therefore, estimating the risk imposed by unplanned ignitions in this fire-prone region will further increase resilience toward wildfires. Currently, a fire-risk map does not exist in this region. The main objective of this study is to provide a spatial analysis of regions at high risk of fast wildfire spread, particularly in the first two hours, considering varying scenarios of ignition locations and atmospheric conditions. To achieve this goal, multiple wildfire simulations were conducted using the FARSITE fire spread model with three ignition modeling methods and three wind scenarios. The first ignition method considers ignitions randomly distributed in 500 m buffers around previously observed ignition sites. Since these ignitions are mainly clustered around roads and trails, the second method considers a 50 m buffer around this built infrastructure, with ignition points randomly sampled from within this buffer. The third method assumes a Euclidean distance decay of ignition probability around roads and trails up to 1000 m, where the probability of selection linearly decreases further from the transportation paths. The ignition modeling methods were then employed in wildfire simulations with varying wind scenarios representing the climatological wind pattern and strong, downslope wind events. A large number of modeled ignitions were located near the major-exit highway running north-south (HWY 154), resulting in more simulated wildfires burning in that region. This could impact evacuation route planning and resource allocation under climatological wind conditions. The simulated fire areas were smaller, and the wildfires did not spread far from the ignition locations. In contrast, wildfires ignited during strong, northerly winds quickly spread into the wildland-urban interface (WUI) toward suburban and urban areas.",wildfire modeling; FARSITE; fire weather; Sundowner winds; ignition modeling; WUI,2022,5,5,10.3390/fire5050138,2571-6255,15,103,303,2097,6,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,yes,no,yes

However, current remote-sensing models for assessing burn severity and forest change in the U.S. are generally based on data collected from California, USA, forests and may not be suitable in other forested ecoregions. To address this problem, we collected field data from 21 wildfires in the American Southwest and developed region-specific models for assessing post-wildfire burn severity and forest change from remotely sensed imagery. We created indices (delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR), relative delta normalized burn ratio (RdNBR), and the relative burn ratio (RBR)) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery using pre- and post-fire image pairs.

FIRE-SWITZERLAND,Indonesian Forest and Land Fire Prevention Patrol System,"(1) Background: The management of forest and land fires has become of concern to the Indonesian government, as demonstrated by the issuing of the Presidential Instruction of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2015, then replaced by Number 3 of 2020, concerning Forest and Land Fire Management. In 2002, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) established Manggala Agni, a forest fire management organization, at the central government level. This study aims to explain the development of the Indonesian Forest and Land Fire Prevention Patrol System. The system development was conducted by the Computer Science Department of IPB University, in collaboration with the Agency for Climate Change and Forest and Land Fire Management, as well as the Directorate of Forest and Land Fire Management, MoEF.

FIRE-SWITZERLAND,"Mid-Term Changes in Soil Properties after Wildfire, Straw Mulching and Salvage Logging in Pinus halepensis Mill. Forests","The hydrological effects of straw mulching and salvage logging have been widely experimented in the Mediterranean forests affected by wildfires. In contrast, knowledge about the impacts of these post-fire management techniques on the physico-chemical properties of burned soils is poor, especially many years after the fire. In particular, no studies have evaluated the soil changes after the combinations of soil mulching and salvage logging after wildfires in Mediterranean forests. To fill this gap, this study explores the effects of straw mulching and salvage logging, applied individually or in combination to a burnt forest of Pinus halepensis Mill. of central-eastern Spain, on the physico-chemical properties of soil six years after a wildfire. Both the post-fire techniques significantly altered the organic matter, phosphorous, and carbonate contents of the burned soils as well as their C/N (carbon/nitrogen) ratio, while the texture and other chemical properties (pH, electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, potassium, cations/anions, and active limestone) of the soils were not significantly affected by these post-fire treatments. Organic matter (OM) and phosphorous (P) contents increased by 57\% and 69\%, respectively, in mulched soils in comparison to the burned but untreated plots. In logged soils, the OM increased by 27\%, while P decreased by 17\%. Salvage logging after straw mulching increased OM, albeit less than under the individual soil treatments (+13\%), but noticeably reduced P (-39\%). The C/N ratio practically underwent the same variation (+15-20\%) after the combination of the two treatments. The principal component analysis and the agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis applied to the soil properties measured in the plots under the individual and combined management show that the effects of salvage logging on soil properties appear to be more impactful compared to straw mulching.",post-fire management; organic matter; nutrients; high-severity fires; Mediterranean forests,2022,5,5,10.3390/fire5050158,2571-6255,17,120,281,1931,5,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,yes,no,yes
FIRE-SWITZERLAND,"Double-Differenced dNBR: Combining MODIS and Landsat Imagery to Map Fine-Grained Fire MOSAICS in Lowland Eucalyptus Savanna in Kakadu National Park, Northern Australia","A neglected dimension of the fire regime concept is fire patchiness. Habitat mosaics that emerge from the grain of burned and unburned patches (pyrodiversity) are critical for the persistence of a diverse range of plant and animal species. This issue is of particular importance in frequently burned tropical Eucalyptus savannas, where coarse fire mosaics have been hypothesized to have caused the recent drastic population declines of small mammals. Satellites routinely used for fire mapping in these systems are unable to accurately map fine-grained fire mosaics, frustrating our ability to determine whether declines in biodiversity are associated with local pyrodiversity. To advance this problem, we have developed a novel method (we call `double-differenced dNBR') that combines the infrequent (c. 16 days) detailed spatial resolution Landsat with daily coarse scale coverage of MODIS and VIIRS to map pyrodiversity in the savannas of Kakadu National Park. We used seasonal Landsat mosaics and differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) to define burned areas, with a modification to dNBR that subtracts long-term average dNBR to increase contrast. Our results show this approach is effective in mapping fine-scale fire mosaics in the homogenous lowland savannas, although inappropriate for nearby heterogenous landscapes. Comparison of this methods to other fire metrics (e.g., area burned, seasonality) based on Landsat and MODIS imagery suggest this method is likely accurate and better at quantifying fine-scale patchiness of fire, albeit it demands detailed field validation.",fire management; fire regime; pyrodiversity; pyrogeography; remote sensing; wildlife; wildfire; landsat,2022,5,5,10.3390/fire5050160,2571-6255,22,167,232,1585,8,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,yes,no,yes
FIRE-SWITZERLAND,Bushfire-Resistant Lightweight Masonry Blocks with Expanded Perlite Aggregate,"During bushfires, one of the building elements that is directly exposed to embers, radiant heat and direct flames is the ``wall{''} element. This study investigated the feasibility of using expanded perlite aggregate in masonry (i.e., cement) blocks to enhance their bushfire resistant characteristics. The chemical, physical, and thermal properties of expanded perlite aggregate were determined first and then masonry block cement mixes were developed by replacing sand in the conventional mix with expanded perlite aggregate by volume at different percentages (100, 80, 60, and 40\%). The properties of fresh and hardened cement mixes (slump, density, compressive strength, and water absorption) were measured. The developed masonry blocks were exposed to Bushfire Flame Zone conditions (i.e., 20-842 degrees C) and the standard fire curve for three hours (i.e., 20-1110 degrees C) to assess their resistance to bushfires and building fires, respectively. The properties of Cement-Expanded Perlite mixes were compared with those of the standard Cement-Sand mix. The test results showed that the use of perlite aggregate reduced the workability, density, and compressive strength of the cement mix while increasing the water absorption and fire resistance level.

FIRE-SWITZERLAND,Fire Severity Causes Temporal Changes in Ground-Dwelling Arthropod Assemblages of Patagonian Araucaria-Nothofagus Forests,"Fire is one of the main drivers of anthropogenic disturbances in temperate forest ecosystems worldwide, with multiple effects spread across ecological networks. Nevertheless, the biodiversity effects of fire are poorly known for species-diverse groups such as arthropods. In this research, we used a burn gradient generated two and three years after a large fire event to assess how different levels of fire severity affect arthropod diversity in the forest with the main forest forming long-living tree species Araucaria araucana, in southern Chile. The species richness and abundance of arthropods among trophic guilds was estimated annually in four fire-severity levels. We found that arthropods responded differently to fire severity levels, depending on their trophic guilds and years after fire (two and three years after fire). During the second year after fire, zoophages, phytophages, and parasitoids were more diverse in areas with high fire severity within the second year after fire, as compared to those in areas with low severity or unburned stands. In the third year after fire, a change in this trend was observed, where the abundance of all groups dropped significantly, with positive changes in the diversity in zoophages, phytophages, polyphages and saprophages, which is more noticeable in sites with high severity. These results indicate that annual variation in environmental conditions triggers bottom-up cascading effects for arthropods. Forests stands severely impacted by fires support highly fluctuating and possibly unstable arthropod assemblages. Hence, restoration efforts should be focused on recovering microhabitat conditions in these stands to allow the persistence of arthropods.",Araucaria araucana; disturbance; epigeic entomofauna; disturbances; National Reserve; trophic guild,2022,5,5,10.3390/fire5050168,2571-6255,13,121,251,1714,6,NA,200,10,Other structure requirements,225,175,yes,no,yes
FOOD WEBS,Functional diversity in herbivorous fishes on Caribbean reefs: The role of macroalgal traits in driving interspecific differences in feeding behavior,"Understanding how functional traits drive plant-herbivore interactions often illuminates the mechanisms driving niche partitioning and functional diversity in this important guild of consumers. On coral reefs, a diverse suite of herbivorous fishes is key for controlling algal abundance and impacting benthic community dynamics. Here, we focus on how algal traits shape complementarity in feeding for a diverse suite of large herbivorous fishes on a coral reef in the wider Caribbean. We used feeding assays in the field to document feeding patterns of the different herbivorous fishes across 50 species of macroalgae. Then, we used a suite of macroalgal traits such as dry mass, nutrient content, calcification, and chemical defenses to assess how these traits influenced patterns of consumption. Algal defenses were the major traits determining the overall vulnerability of algae to herbivores, with uncalcified algae from undefended genera being consumed 40\% more rapidly than algae that were either calcified or chemically defended. Nutrient content of algae explained little in patterns of overall herbivory. We found significant niche diversification in feeding both among and within genera with the three major genera having unique feeding patterns on different suites of algae (Acanthurus spp. -red macroalgae, Sparisoma spp. -brown and green macroalgae, and Scarus spp. -benthic filamentous algae). With respect to how algal traits influenced patterns of feeding in individual species, we found that: (1) some herbivore species were almost exclusively influenced by avoiding algal defenses, (2) some species showed strong interactions between algal defenses and nutrient content that determined their feeding, and (3) some species (Kyphosus spp., Pomacanthus arcuatus) targeted chemically-defended algae with high nutrient content. Our work highlights the role that algal traits play in influencing patterns in the diversity and redundancy of feeding in herbivorous fishes on coral reefs.",Browsing; Complementarity; Grazing; Redundancy; Stoichiometry; Top-down,2022,33,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00255,2352-2496,20,149,289,1998,6,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Cattle dung in aquatic habitats alters mosquito predatory biocontrol dynamics,"Anthropogenic land use changes influence ecosystem functioning and may alter trophic interactions. Intensification of free-range pastoral farming could promote degradation of aquatic habitats, with nutrient inputs adversely affecting water quality and resident communities. Reductions in natural enemies (and potentially efficacy thereof) and dampening of their interaction strength could promote the proliferation of vector mosquitoes, with consequences for disease transmission and nuisance biting. This study examined implications of a cattle dung eutrophication gradient (T0-T4: 0 g L-1, 1 g L-1, 2 g L-1, 4 g L-1 and 8 g L-1) on aquatic habitats for trophic and non-trophic interactions by two larval mosquito (Culex pipiens) natural enemies (notonectid: Anisops sardea; copepod: Lovenula falcifera) using comparative functional responses. Copepods generally exhibited lower interaction strength compared to notonectids, both as individuals and conspecific pairs. Effects of dung pollutants differed among predator groups, with high concentrations dampening interaction strengths being observed for single/paired copepods and paired notonectids, but not single notonectids or heterospecific pairs. Individual predators exhibited Type II functional responses, with feeding rates largely similar across dung concentrations within species. Non-trophic interactions were predominantly negative (i.e., antagonistic) between conspecific pairs and scaled unimodally with prey density. Dung pollution intensified negative non-trophic interactions in notonectid pairs, whereas heterospecific pairs exhibited positive (i.e., synergistic) non-trophic interactions at the highest dung concentration. Physico-chemical properties indicated that turbidity and pH increased with dung treatment concentrations, whereas conductivity and total dissolved solids both peaked at 1 g L-1 and 2 g L-1. These results improve understanding of mosquito regulation in degraded habitats, indicting effects of agricultural pollutants dampen trophic interaction strengths, depending on the taxon.",Culex pipiens; Copepod; Ecosystem functioning; Functional response; Predator-prey interaction strength; Non-trophic interactions; Notonectid,2022,32,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00241,2352-2496,10,77,266,2070,7,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Grey wolf feeding habits and their geographical variation in Northwest Spain,"This study investigates wolf (Canis lupus) dietary preferences and their geographical variation by calculating frequency of occurrence and biomass consumption in three areas in the north-western Iberian Peninsula that differ in terms of the type and abundance of potential prey. Wolf dietary preferences were expected to be related to the availability of a species of free-roaming horses (Equus ferus atlanticus) and much less to traditional livestock in each habitat. The diet of wolves was found to comprise mostly Galician feral horses when available, with a low proportion of livestock. The next most consumed species were wild boar (Sus scrofa) and cattle (Bos taurus taurus). A much higher consumption of traditional livestock (84\% biomass) was observed in the one study area where there were no feral horses. The fact that access to feral horses may help decrease wolf predation on other species of livestock which are more economically important and the environmental benefits of horses in protecting against forest fires suggest that conservation and expansion of this endangered species of horses should be encouraged. Strengthening existing populations and possibly re-introducing native wild species within the wolf's range may be the most environmentally friendly way to reduce economic losses for farmers and cattle breeders.",Canis lupus; Galician feral horses; Human -carnivore conflict; Livestock predation; Prey selection; Scat analysis,2022,32,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00248,2352-2496,11,76,202,1340,6,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes

Isotopic results indicated interspecies variations in the trophic web structure with mean d C-13 values of - 20.0\% (zooplankton) < 18.2 \% (M. henlei) < 14.1 \% (Thaisella kiosquiformis, mollusk). In general, delta N-15 and delta C-13 values increased from primary consumers (zooplankton) to predators, following the isotopic patterns of other trophic webs. The concentrations of Cd, Hg and Se were relatively less in most of the organisms except mollusks that presented high concentrations of Cd. The biomagnification factors of the trophic web showed biodilution of Cd (Food Web Magnification Factor, FWMFCd = 0.2), biomagnification of Hg (FWMFHg = 3.34) and Se (FWMFSe = 1.45) respectively. However, the concentrations of Se did not increase consistently from the lower trophic levels to the higher ones. This study documents the dynamics of a marine trophic structure and demonstrates that biodilution/biomagnification processes of metal contaminants are largely species specific and are closely related to physical - chemical and food web structure.",Biodilution; Biomagnification; Trace elements; Trophic web; Baja California Sur,2022,34,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00263,2352-2496,20,138,212,1413,5,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,"Effects of urbanization on the trophic niche of the brown anole, a widespread invasive lizard","Urbanization is one of the most dramatic forms of environmental change with the potential to alter trophic relationships among organisms in cities. In this study, we combine gut-content and stable isotope analyses of brown anole diets with field sampling of arthropods to assess whether and how urbanization-induced variation of basal resources influence trophic niche variation of anole populations inhabiting urban, suburban, and natural habitats. We found clear evidence for trophic niche variation across the urbanization gradient. Stable isotope analyses revealed that urban and suburban anoles had strongly elevated 813C levels and slightly lower 815N levels compared to anoles from natural forests- results consistent with increased reliance on grasses across the ur-banization gradient. Isotopic niche widths were also greater in urban habitats. However, our analysis of anole diets revealed no difference in the diversity of prey consumed-despite urban habitats having the highest di-versity of available prey compared to suburban and natural forest habitats. Overall, our results suggest that much of the observed variation in food web structure results from a shift in the diversity of basal resource pools across the urbanization gradient. The broader effects of a shift towards grass-dominated food webs in urban habitats remains to be understood.",Urbanization; Stable isotopes; Diet; Anolis; Resource subsidy; Food webs,2022,33,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00257,2352-2496,15,93,198,1360,6,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Predators affect a plant virus through density and trait-mediated indirect effects on vectors,"Biological control programs frequently rely on insect predators to control pests that vector plant pathogens in agroecosystems. Predators affect vectors by eating them (consumptive effects) and by inducing antipredator behaviors (non-consumptive effects), and these interactions may affect transmission of vector-borne pathogens. However, it has proven difficult to experimentally tease apart the effects of predators on vector fitness and behavior as they are often correlated. We addressed this problem by assessing how both aphids and an aphid -borne pathogen were affected by variable predation risk. Specifically, we experimentally manipulated lady -beetle predators' mouthparts to isolate consumptive, and non-consumptive, effects of predators on aphid fitness, movement, and virus transmission. We show that although lethal predators decreased aphid vector abundance, they increased pathogen transmission by increasing aphid movement among hosts. Moreover, aphids responded to risk of predation by moving to younger plant tissue that was more susceptible to the pathogen. Aphids also responded to predator risk through compensatory reproduction, which offset direct consumptive effects. Our results support predictions of disease models showing alterations of vector movement due to predators can have greater effects on transmission of pathogens than vector consumption, which should be considered when examining natural enemies' role in pathogen dynamics. Broadly, our study shows isolating direct and indirect predation effects can reveal novel pathways by which predators affect vector-borne pathogens.",Predation risk; Disease ecology; Insect vector; Plant virus; Trait -mediated effects; Structural equation modeling,2022,33,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00251,2352-2496,13,93,219,1613,6,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Who feeds on whom in semi-aquatic moss ecosystems?,"Moss patches growing at the interface between terrestrial and limnic ecosystems (in the splash-water zone) are colonized by terrestrial, semi-aquatic, and aquatic animals. Besides being a refuge, mosses provide food resources, such as micro-algae, particulate organic matter, and moss tissues themselves. In this study, the standing stocks and isotopic signatures of both resources and consumers were measured to analyze the trophic channels utilized by moss-dwelling consumers in two semi-aquatic moss ecosystems of a stream and a lake. The mean total invertebrate abundance (+/- SD) in the lake mosses was 1109.08 +/- 230.33 ind.10(gmoss)DW(- 1), which was \~{}4-fold higher than in the stream (265.37 +/- 184.62 ind.10(gmoss)DW(-1)). We found that moss tissues were a fairly minor contributor to the diets of the invertebrates; instead the most important resource for invertebrates was the epiphytic biofilms growing on them. The moss-dwelling community in the lake occupied a larger isotopic space than in the stream, suggesting a lower trophic redundancy of the community in the lake. This was especially the case for the delta C-13 range, which was 39\% larger in the lake than in the stream, where delta C-13 signatures appeared more focused. In contrast, the delta N-15 range of the invertebrate community associated with mosses was rather large and did not differ substantially between stream and lake. Dorylaimid nematodes, predatory dipters and water mites showed enriched delta N-15 signatures suggesting they could occupy apex positions in moss food webs despite their small body sizes. Our results suggested that mosses were not an important food resource, but instead their textural complexity enabled a coherent and relatively large invertebrate food web composed of detritivores, algivores, omnivores, predators, and probably parasites.",Stable isotopes; Community ecology; Food web; Trophic niche; Meiofauna,2022,32,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00237,2352-2496,8,50,276,1853,5,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Grasshopper feeding preference affects cascading effects of predators on plant biomass in a mixed-grass prairie,"The importance of cascading effects of grasshopper predators on plant biomass involving grasshoppers in grassland ecosystems appears variable. A constraint of most grasshopper trophic cascade studies to date is that they examine responses of a single grasshopper species, while grasshopper feeding guilds could affect whether a trophic cascade is observed. As grasslands are grass dominated, grass feeding grasshoppers generally have stronger impacts on plant biomass than mixed grass and forb feeding species indicating that trophic cascades should be observed more commonly with grass feeding species. Grasshopper feeding preference could have important implications for predicting the outcome of grasshopper predator-prey interactions. I conducted similar experiments in two years with different grasshopper feeding guilds, grass feeding and mixed grass and forb feeding, to examine the importance of cascading predator effects at a grass dominated prairie site. For both experiments, treatments consisted of invertebrate removal, herbivore only, and herbivore plus predator treatments. There was no indication of a trophic cascade with high densities of a mixed feeding grasshopper species in a year with lower biomass production. Although plant regrowth following herbivory can weaken the appearance of trophic cascades, a trophic cascade on grass biomass was evident with high densities of a grass feeding grasshopper during a year with higher biomass production. As a result, plant preference appears to impact the importance of cascading effects of predators on plant biomass in this system.",Trophic cascade; Spider; Herbivory; Grasshopper; Predator-prey interactions; Grassland,2022,31,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00224,2352-2496,15,111,229,1599,6,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Habitat complexity mediates spatiotemporal niche partitioning among native and invasive seed predators,"Red imported fire ants dominate certain food webs in North America due to their omnivorous and aggressive feeding behavior. Structural habitat complexity can mediate effects of invasive predators on native insects, by either facilitating or tempering antagonistic interactions, with potential consequences at lower trophic levels. Along a gradient of habitat complexity, we evaluated how refuge affects the activity and foraging behavior of fire ants and native invertebrate seed predators using video surveillance, and then determined their consumption of pigweed seeds in seed removal assays. Fire ants dominated seed predation in our system, and structural complexity increased both their activity and seed removal, while reducing that of native seed predators. In structurally simple habitats with high sun exposure, fire ant activity was restricted to the evening when tem-peratures were milder, while native seed predators foraged during the heat of the day, possibly to avoid antagonistic interactions with fire ants. In relatively shaded, structurally complex habitat, the active foraging period for fire ants expanded earlier into the heat of the day, and almost totally overlapped with that of native seed predators. Our data suggest that structural refuge may facilitate antagonism and site/resource domination by fire ants.",Habitat complexity; Intraguild predation; Solenopsis invicta; Seed predation,2022,32,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00243,2352-2496,12,102,194,1335,4,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Top-predator removal does not cause trophic cascades in Australian rangeland ecosystems,"Increased demand for livestock products is exacerbating conflict with predators in many parts of the world, fuelling an increase in predation management practices in many grazing systems. In Australia, exclusion fences are being erected across broad areas to facilitate the sustained eradication of dingoes, an apex predator, prompting concern for possible cascading effects on extant wildlife populations. We experimentally assessed population trends of mammals, reptiles and ground-dwelling birds inside and outside of two large, fenced areas over a five-year period subsequent to the erection of the fences and the removal of dingoes. Wildlife population abundances inside the fences were always higher or the same as outside the fences, and all wildlife species exhibited similar population trends within each treatment over time. The only exception to this was kangaroo populations, which fluctuated widely inside fenced areas but remained relatively low and stable outside fenced areas. Kangaroos exhibited negative relationships with dingoes, although unmeasured variables limited our ability to quantify specific causes for kangaroo population trends. Vegetation trends were virtually identical between treatments, indicating that wildlife population trends are closely linked to vegetation conditions and not predator abundances. These applied, experimental results demonstrate that top-predator removal does not routinely cause trophic cascades (including mesopredator releases) in Australian rangeland ecosystems. We therefore encourage exploration of opportunities for targeted threatened species recovery in predator-free areas on land used for livestock production.",Apex predator; Conservation fencing; Land sharing; Human-wildlife conflict; Predation; Threatened species conservation,2022,31,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00229,2352-2496,11,87,227,1679,6,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Death from below: Sit-and-wait predatory behavior in a burrowing crayfish (Lacunicambarus thomai),"The biology of burrowing crayfishes remains elusive to biologists, primarily because these animals spend a majority of their lives within the confines of their burrow. Scattered observations of burrowing crayfishes have suggested that burrowing crayfish may exhibit a greater degree of surface activity than previously thought. Surface behavior may be related to social interactions, predator defense, or prey capture. But documentation of these behaviors is rare, and few studies have been conducted on the predatory behaviors of burrowing crayfishes. Here, we report the findings of 24-h video recording surveys conducted on a burrowing crayfish species, the Little Brown Mudbug (Lacunicambarus thomai). In total, we recorded and watched 633 h of video. We observed L. thomai sitting atop their burrow engaging in sit-and-wait predatory behavior. This ambush predatory behavior was used on several different animal prey items, including spiders (Lycosidae), slugs (Philomycidae), and dragonfly nymphs (Aeshnidae). We also we recorded crayfish cutting terrestrial vegetation near their burrow entrance and pulling it down into their burrow. Additionally, we analyzed the gut contents of 23 L. thomai from 4 populations to understand the generality of our foraging observations. Indeed, gut content analyses confirmed that all populations consumed both animal prey and vegetation. Overall, our recordings demonstrate that sit-andwait predatory behavior may be a common foraging behavior among burrowing crayfishes. Further, our observations highlight the trophic role of burrowing crayfish species and emphasizes how these animals forage on both animal and plant communities in terrestrial habitats.",Ambush predation; Burrowing; Crayfish behavior; Crayfish foraging; Diet; Predatory strategies; Trophic ecology,2022,31,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00225,2352-2496,12,97,242,1699,7,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Single and mixed diets of the toxic Cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa and Raphidiopsis raciborskii differently affect Daphnia feeding behavior,"Cyanobacteria usually dominate phytoplankton in eutrophic water bodies, where they form dense monospecific or mixed blooms. Moreover, these organisms are an important energy source for aquatic food webs in these environments, establishing a direct link with zooplankton. In contrast, cyanobacteria can weaken that link by limiting zooplankton grazing pressure due to morphological and chemical traits such as the production of toxic peptides and alkaloids. Nevertheless, some zooplankton survive under CyanoHABs (cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms) and it has been related to both physiological tolerance and behavioral mechanisms, the last being less explored. Thus, we aimed to investigate the impact of a single and mixed diet of different toxin-producing cyanobacteria on the feeding behavior of two species of Daphnia. Adult individuals of the species Daphnia similis (large) and D. laevis (small) were fed with single and mixed cell suspensions of the toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa and Raphidiopsis raciborskii at gradually increased proportions (0-90\%) relative to the edible green algae Monoraphidium capricornutum. Here, we found a marked decrease in the filtration (measured as clearance rate) of D. similis but not for D. laevis as cyanobacteria increased in suspension. At the same condition, both daphnids displayed a nonselective behavior despite a reduced ingestion rate food of edible algae. Our study shows that cyanobacteria may directly and indirectly impact Daphnia filtration rate and ability to forage for edible food.",Zooplankton; Foraging; Cyanotoxins; Harmful algae,2022,32,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00245,2352-2496,18,145,224,1555,4,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,High-throughput sequencing reveals prey diversity overlap between sympatric Sulids in the tropical Atlantic,"Seabirds breeding at tropical latitudes suffer an increased pressure to forage efficiently, because oligotrophic waters have less abundant and more patchily distributed prey. In related species living in sympatry, trophic or spatial niche partitioning may emerge as a strategy to mitigate increased competition. However, studies using molecular methodologies such as high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to test for these strategies are still scarce. In this study we used HTS to assess prey diversity partitioning on two sulid species living sympatrically in the tropical Raso Islet (Cabo Verde). Brown boobies (Sula leucogaster) breed in Raso Islet throughout the year while Red-footed boobies (Sula sula) occur during molt, from June to October. We compared Brown boobies diet prey diversity between the two periods (non-coexistence vs. coexistence with Red-footed booby), as well as between both sulids while in coexistence. Overall, the diets of all groups were clearly dominated by a small number of Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs), with a predominance of flying fish. The diet composition of Brown boobies was significantly different between the two time periods, most likely due to temporal differences in prey availability or possible competition with other seabird species. Brown boobies exploited a wider taxo-nomic range of prey, while Red-footed boobies used a subset of Brown boobies' prey diversity. Furthermore, we did not find intersexual differences in the diet composition of both species. Overall, we did not find evidence that prey diversity partitioning occurred, probably due to the parallel occurrence of spatial niche partitioning.",Resources partitioning; Diet; Metabarcoding; Seabirds; Cabo Verde,2022,33,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00258,2352-2496,13,107,244,1666,5,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Unconventional bird predators are relevant to vertebrate trophic relationships? A community science platform helps to answer this question.,"Birds stand out among animal predators due their high species diversity and ecological flexibility. In a restrictive sense, bird predators include species that had vertebrate meat as main food item (conventional bird predators). However, insectivores, frugivores and omnivores birds occasionally include vertebrates in their diets (unconventional bird predators). Here, we use photographs posted in a community science platform (wikiaves) to examine the importance of conventional and unconventional bird predators to the trophic structure of Neotropical vertebrate assemblages. After detailed inspection of 71,285 photographs, we built a database of 6553 feeding events from 640 species distributed in 32 bird families. Vertebrates are part of the diet of 92 species of conventional and 91 species of unconventional bird predators. As expected, diets of conventional bird predators are predominantly composed of vertebrates (84\% of feeding records, n = 1689), although invertebrates were also relevant for diets of owls, hawks and herons. In contrast, vertebrates comprised only 8\% of feeding records (n = 358) among the unconventional bird predators. The contribution of vertebrates to diets of unconventional bird predators was relevant (> 10\% of feeding records) in five of 24 analyzed bird families. Fishes, mammals and birds are the main preys of conventional predators, whereas unconventional predators focusing on ectothermic vertebrates (amphibians and reptiles). Unconventional predators expand the diversity of local vertebrate predators and consume distinct preys compared to conventional predators. Therefore, families of unconventional bird predators must be considered relevant to food web analysis of Neotropical vertebrate assemblages.",Neotropical birds; Wikiaves; Food webs; Amphibians; Lizards; Photographs,2022,31,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00232,2352-2496,18,139,245,1755,6,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Individual trophic niche specialization in American beaver (Castor canadensis),"The American beaver (Castor canadensis) has been described as a choosy generalist at the species/population scale, yet observational studies have shown little variation in diet among individuals. We compared isotopic values of delta C-13 or delta N-15 taken from hair of 32 beaver, representing seven colonies in northern Alabama, USA to determine 1) if colonies of beaver show overlap in isotopic niche width as a result of the similar use of food resources and 2) if individual trophic niche specialization occurs within colonies. Total Trophic Niche Width varied across the wetland with the widest being twice the narrowest. Each of the five niche ellipses overlapped with >= two other wetlands studied. The percentages of observed variance attributed to Within Individual Component, Between Individual Component, and Between Location Component for delta C-13 were 37\%, 33\%, 30\%; and those for delta N-15 were 16\%, 56\%, and 28\%. Dietary nitrogen differentiated the trophic niches of individual beavers. Our results revealed that colonies across the landscape showed separation in trophic niche, lending support that the choosy generalist classification is correct at the colony scale. Our results also support individual trophic niche specialization within colonies, as seen by the substantial amount variation in both delta C-13 (33\%) and delta N-15 (56\%) between individuals.",Castor canadensis; Central place foraging; Stable isotope; Trophic niche,2022,32,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00235,2352-2496,9,78,208,1388,4,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Trophic hierarchy in a marine community revealed by network analysis on co-occurrence data,"Network analysis is employed in biodiversity studies to explore the possible ecological implications of taxa co-occurrences across time or space, but the conceptual robustness of this approach is still under debate. Herein, by focusing our attention on a marine pelagic community previously described by metabarcoding data gathered over a time-series, we explore the usefulness of co-occurrence networks to derive information about food web structures. In our effort we studied a published co-occurrence network by conducting bibliographic research to identify which links were potentially related to ecological interactions. Although biologically plausible links were the minority, we found that they were enough to construct realistic ecological networks. We therefore assembled trophic and non-trophic networks including both putatively biological links and those not explainable based on the literature; we analyzed these networks separately by estimating several indicators chosen among those resulted as informative of ecological processes in previous research. In the trophic networks, we detected some structural properties and `trophic hierarchies' commonly found in food webs with approaches different from co-occurrence networks, such as: i) a positive relationship between body size and trophic level (this latter defined in terms of network topology, i.e., the arrangement of nodes and links in a network); and ii) realistic shifts in the network roles played by co-occurring taxa (i.e., hubs and keystone species), which allowed the persistence of hierarchy despite environmental variability. Our results reveal the power of applying co-occurrence networks in capturing the ecological properties of marine communities, plus possible ecological changes occurring under different environmental conditions. However, such application potential is deeply constrained by the acquiring of fine-scale knowledge of the trophic habits of the taxa in the community of reference.",Co-occurrence network; Marine ecology; Marine food web; Network analysis; Plankton,2022,32,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00246,2352-2496,13,90,276,1981,5,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes

FOOD WEBS,Increased nutrient availability correlates with increased growth of the benthic jellyfish Cassiopea spp.,"Jellyfish are an important but underappreciated food source in marine food webs. Human activities influence the abundance of jellyfish, potentially affecting marine trophic dynamics. Human activities such as nutrient loading may also influence the size structure of jellyfish populations, affecting food webs, yet little is known about indirect or direct mechanistic pathways driving shifts in size. In this experiment, we manipulated nutrient concentrations to test if elevated nutrient availability affected growth of the zooxanthellate, benthic jellyfish taxa Cassiopea spp. We found that in the nutrient-enriched treatment, the estimated body mass of jellyfish increased on average 0.24 +/- 0.29\% d-1, likely as a result of elevated autotrophic carbon supply. Conversely, jellyfish in the ambient nutrient treatment shrank, possibly reflecting reduced food availability as a result of the enclosures that jellyfish were kept in or effects associated with negative density dependence. Our findings suggest that humanderived nutrients may benefit these jellyfish taxa and, more broadly, we provide an example of how environmental conditions can mediate the size structure of jellyfish populations with potential implications for marine food webs.",Anthropogenic nutrients; Benthic; Gelatinous zooplankton; Marine food webs; The Bahamas,2022,31,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00231,2352-2496,13,104,176,1249,5,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FOOD WEBS,Association between arthropod densities suggests dominance of top-down control of predator-prey food-webs on pear trees during winter,"Although winter in the temperate zone is considered to be the period of arthropod quiescence, some pests and their natural enemies remain active and interact in simplified food-webs. Limited information exists about the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes regulating arthropod food-webs and their spatio-temporal dynamics during winter. This information is essential for the development of effective conservation biocontrol methods. We investigated how the pest management of pear orchards (integrated {[}IPM] vs organic) and tree location within orchards (margin vs centre) influence the association between densities of winter-active spiders, insect herbivores and winter-inactive predators (spiders, insects) from October to April. We installed carboard bands on trunks and branches of pear trees in four organic and four IPM orchards to collect bark -dwelling arthropods. We then modelled relationships between the densities of four functional arthropod groups, namely winter-active spiders, winter-inactive spiders, winter-inactive insect predators, and herbivores. In early winter, we found a hump-shaped relationship between the densities of winter-active spiders and her-bivores. This agrees with the top-down model of the ecosystem exploitation hypothesis, predicting that predators are first bottom-up limited, then accumulate with prey densities, and exert top-down control when they become sufficiently abundant. The densities of herbivores strongly declined during winter, a phenomenon which may be partly, along with other causes of natural mortality, attributable to predation by winter active spiders. The as-sociation between winter-active spiders and winter-inactive arthropod predators switched from positive to none in organic orchards or even to a negative association in IPM orchards. Negative intraguild interactions seem to be intensified due to the declining availability of alternative prey. Overall, the investigated food-webs seem to be mostly top-down regulated during winter, and IPM seems to intensify intraguild interactions.",Biocontrol; Ecosystem exploitation hypothesis; Food -web; IPM; Organic management; Winter activity,2022,33,NA,10.1016/j.fooweb.2022.e00261,2352-2496,17,133,282,2077,6,NA,350,6,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"A two-dimensional morphospace for cyanobacteria and microalgae: Morphological diversity, evolutionary relatedness, and size constraints","Body metrics are considered as master traits that regulate physiological, behavioural and life history features of planktic cyanobacteria and microalgae. Although the distribution of their morphological traits reflects the various trade-offs and strategies needed for survival in pelagic habitats, previous methods for quantifying phytoplankton body shape do not adequately represent the intricate details of surface variation that are so important for their nutrient- and light-harvesting capabilities. Therefore, here we provide a new framework to quantify and illustrate the morphological diversity of cyanobacteria and microalgae. Essential components of formulae used for surface area (A = Cs x d(2)) and volume (V = Cv x d(3)) calculations are provided by the shape-specific surface area and volume constants (Cs, Cv). Cs, the surface shape factor, characterises the coarseness of the object surface, and Cv, the volumetric shape factor, characterises the shape deviation from a sphere. Using these morphologically and biologically relevant variables, we defined a two-dimensional morphological space, in which all three-dimensional objects have well-defined positions. By analysing morphologies of taxa representing various forms in major cyanobacterial and microalgal groups, we demonstrated that these groups show considerable differences in the area occupied within the morphospace and these differences are not affected by evolutionary relatedness. We showed that the ratio of surface and volume constants correlated with organism size, suggesting that the development of basic morphologies is constrained by their linear dimensions. Using surface and volumetric shape factors, we created a two-dimensional Euclidean morphospace in which all three-dimensional objects have a specific position. Positioning uni- and multicellular cyanobacteria and microalgae of various shapes into this morphospace allows their geometrical and ecological limitations to be understood. Because of the close linkage between phytoplankton morphology and ecology, the proposed morphospace may serve as a proxy for an ecospace. Thus, in future the proposed morphospace can be used to visualise current ecological processes such as eutrophication or seasonal succession of phytoplankton.",3D algae; geometry; morphological traits; phylogenetic control; shape complexity,2023,68,1,10.1111/fwb.14013,0046-5070,14,135,314,2275,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Comparative impacts of dam water level regimes on herbaceous plant growth strategies in cascade reservoirs and downstream reaches of a major river,"Flow regulation is a prolific and growing influence on rivers world-wide. Nine cascade hydropower dams were constructed along the 1,150-km Wujiang River in China over the past 30 years, disrupting longitudinal continuity. Water level fluctuations in the associated reservoirs range between daily, weekly, seasonal, and annual, depending on the type of regulation, but the comparative impacts of these regimes on plant growth strategies, or the extent of their downstream influence, is unknown. Competitor, stress-tolerator, and ruderal (CSR) plant strategies were used to assess the impact of reservoir regulation type on the riparian herbaceous plant community based on sampling the inundation zone of nine reservoirs and their downstream river reaches during 2017 and 2018. Our results revealed profound differences in CSR plant strategies of the dominant vegetation with respect to water level regime. While ruderal plants dominated (45\%-60\% of species), irrespective of regulation type, vegetation in reservoirs exhibited a strong shift from stress-tolerators (e.g., Cynodon dactylon, C-11.9:S-41.5:R-46.5\%) to competitors (e.g., Reynoutria japonica, C-77.9:S-0:R-22.0\%) with increasing intensity of water level fluctuation, reflecting the shift from annual to daily regulation. The width of the inundation zone was the best overall variable in explaining the CSR strategies of riparian vegetation, both in the reservoir inundation zone (r(2)-adj = 15.4\%) and the downstream river (r(2)-adj = 7.3\%). Retention time significantly explained variation in CSR plant strategies in the reservoir inundation zone (r(2)-adj = 3.7\%, p = 0.002) but not downstream (p > 0.01). There was also a clear scale dependency of CSR plant strategies, with an increase in stress tolerators (average slope = 0.7\%/km) and decline of competitor (average slope = -0.3\%/km) and ruderal plants (average slope = -0.9\%/km) with increasing distance downstream from dams. The growth strategies of the dominant riparian vegetation changed with the magnitude and frequency of water level fluctuations caused by differences in regulation type, and local environmental conditions. Clear scale dependency in the CSR plant strategies was observed with distance from the dam, with ruderals dominating closest to the reservoirs and declining gradually downstream as stress tolerators increased. Our study helps to evaluate the impact of river damming on the functional traits of riparian vegetation and to predict the resilience and restoration potential of riparian vegetation under different forms of human disturbance.",inundation zone; reservoir regulation type; retention time; riparian vegetation; scale-dependency,2023,68,1,10.1111/fwb.14014,0046-5070,22,146,372,2596,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Dark diversity in Amazonian stream fish communities: What factors determine species absence along environmental gradients?,"Species distribution models often fail to predict observed patterns of species diversity, and this is because some species within a regional pool that are tolerant of conditions at a given location may nevertheless be absent from the local community. These missing species have been termed ``dark diversity{''}. In the present study, we investigated which factors explain dark diversity among fish assemblages in Amazonian streams. We sampled 71 streams in areas with different types of land use within two river basins and estimated dark diversity from patterns of species co-occurrence, using Beals' index, along environmental gradients. From this procedure, taxa are designated as dark diversity components when they are absent from a given stream, but often co-occur with the local species at other streams, indicating similar ecological requirements. We used generalised linear models both to determine whether environmental or landscape variables, connectivity, instream environmental heterogeneity or some combination of these factors explained dark diversity of fishes, and to evaluate whether ecomorphology is associated with the extent to which a species contributes to dark diversity and which specific traits contribute the most to explaining variation in dark diversity. Mean local diversity exceeded observed dark diversity. The magnitude of dark diversity was directly associated with the proportion of secondary forest in the immediate catchment and with the index of proximity to anthropogenic impact. Species that have high affinity for environments with higher current velocity, low swimming ability and that capture food mainly on the surface contributed more to dark diversity, which suggests that swimming ability, habitat preference and aspects related to diet are key predictors of the probability that a given species will be present at locations with suitable habitat. Our findings reinforce the idea that dark diversity results from interactions between species traits and environmental factors, including anthropogenic impacts. Understanding the interplay among environmental factors and species traits that contribute to dark diversity provides targets for improved ecosystem restoration and sustainability of native species assemblages.",anthropogenic impact; conservation; functional traits; spatial distribution; species co-occurrence,2023,68,1,10.1111/fwb.14004,0046-5070,15,122,323,2266,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Egestion rates of microplastic fibres in fish scaled to in situ concentration and fish density,"Microplastics (particles <5 mm) are commonly found in aquatic organisms across taxonomic groups and ecosystems. However, the egestion rate of microplastics from aquatic organisms and how egestion rates compare to other rates of microplastic movement in the environment are sparsely documented. We fed microplastic fibres to round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), an abundant, invasive species in the Laurentian Great Lakes. We conducted two trials where round gobies were fed microplastic-containing food either a single time (1 day) or every day over 7 days. There was no difference in microplastic egestion rates from the 1 day or 7 day feeding trials, suggesting no impact of duration of exposure on egestion (exponential decay rate = -0.055 {[}+/- 0.016 SE] and -0.040 {[}+/- 0.007 SE], respectively). Turnover time of microplastics (i.e., average time from ingestion to egestion) in the gut ranged from 18.2 to 25.0 hr, similar to published values for other freshwater taxa. We also measured microplastics in the digestive tracts of round gobies collected directly from Lake Michigan, U.S.A. Using published values for round goby density and microplastic concentration at the study sites, we calculated areal egestion rate by round gobies (no. particles m(-2) day(-1)), and compared it to riverine microplastic export (no. particles m(-2) day(-1)). Both area-based rates were of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that round goby egestion could be an important, and potentially overlooked component of microplastic dynamics at the ecosystem scale. Animal egestion is well-known as a major component of nutrient and carbon cycling. However, direct measurements of microplastic fluxes in the environment that include animal egestion rates are uncommon. An ecosystem ecology approach is needed to meet the emerging challenge of generating microplastic budgets for freshwater environments and elsewhere, thereby informing management and mitigation of plastic pollution at a global scale.",emerging contaminants; Great Lakes; Neogobius melanostomus; plastic pollution; retention time,2023,68,1,10.1111/fwb.14007,0046-5070,15,94,295,1993,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Estimating the spawning activity of fish species using nuclear and mitochondrial environmental DNA concentrations and their ratios,"During spawning activity, fish release large amounts of sperm and eggs into the water, which has been assumed to cause an increase in environmental DNA (eDNA) levels and nuclear DNA/mitochondrial DNA ratios. To test whether these assumptions are valid and whether nuclear and mitochondrial eDNA analysis can be used to monitor the spawning activity of freshwater fish, we conducted field eDNA surveys and traditional surveys using common carp (Cyprinus carpio), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) as model species. Fish spawning periods were estimated based on age, as estimated using the body lengths of juveniles collected in the Miharu reservoir in Fukushima, Japan. The results showed that the main spawning periods of largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish were from April to July and from July to August, respectively. Field eDNA surveys were conducted in the Hebisawagawa front reservoir, which is connected to the Miharu reservoir. From March to August 2019 and 2020, weekly eDNA sampling was conducted at three sites, and daily sampling was conducted at six sites from 23 June to 3 July 2020. The eDNA concentrations of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and mitochondrial cytochrome B (CytB), as well as the ITS1/CytB ratio, were measured for each of the three fish in each water sample. Water temperature had a statistically significant effect on eDNA concentration, probably reflecting the relationship between water temperature and spawning. We created generalised additive mixed models to estimate spawning activity periods based on weekly eDNA data. The estimated periods of spawning activity for common carp, largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish were March to May, May to July, and May to August, respectively. The estimated spawning periods coincided with known fish ecology or the results of traditional methods. This method also has been applied to daily eDNA samples, showing the feasibility of high-resolution estimation of spawning activity. For common carp and bluegill sunfish, we were able to estimate the spawning period using this method. Although the method is affected by biomass and the diffusion and degradation of eDNA, it has the potential to accurately estimating spawning activities. These then can be estimated without conducting laborious traditional surveys, facilitating the monitoring of reproduction by rare, invasive or important fishery species. Further research on the diffusion distance and degradation time of the eDNA concentration peak caused by fish spawning activity may improve the accuracy of monitoring.",eDNA; electrofishing; mtDNA; nuDNA; reservoir,2023,68,1,10.1111/fwb.14012,0046-5070,17,130,394,2616,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Experimentation, modelling, and simulation of hydrochory in an Amazonian river","Seed transport by hydrochory is a key mechanism of long-distance dispersal constrained by attributes of the seed and hydrodynamics of the river, influenced by seasonal precipitation and hydrological pulses. However, the extent to which a hydrodynamic model can predict seed dispersal influenced by a tributary is unknown. The study was conducted along a 10-km stretch of the Falsino River in Amapa, Brazil. Hydrodynamic parameters from the 2021 rainy season were used to calibrate a three-dimensional numerical model (SisBaHia) and simulate hydrochory of Macrolobium bifolium, a widely distributed species in the Amazon floodplains. This model was coupled with a Lagrangian dispersal model to estimate the average transport distance of the fruit plume. The simulated results were compared statistically with those of dispersal quantified in the field. The field experiment coincided with the maximum hydrological pulse, providing with a maximum potential distance of longitudinal dispersal fruit of c. 10 km in 2 hr. The orders of magnitude of the mean plume transport (observed and numerically simulated centre of mass) were compatible with each other over six longitudinal tracking sections (4.0\% <= estimated x observed error <= 16.5\%). Different channel stretches had distinct hydraulic characteristics that influenced spatial dispersal dynamics and are likely to be factors influencing the distribution of M. bifolium in these environments. The present research is a contribution to understanding fluvial hydrodynamics and hydrochory by M. bifolium, whose seed dispersal syndrome is an adaptive characteristic that might explain its abundance and richness in these Amazonian riparian zones.

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Homogenisation of water and sediment bacterial communities in a shallow lake (lake Balihe, China)","Planktonic and benthic bacterial communities hold central roles in the functioning of freshwater ecosystems and mediate key ecosystem services such as primary production and nutrient remineralisation. Although it is clear that such communities vary in composition both within and between lakes, the environmental factors and processes shaping the diversity and composition of freshwater bacteria are still not fully understood. In order to assess seasonal and spatial variability in lake bacterial communities and identify environmental factors underpinning biogeographical patterns, we performed a large-scale sampling campaign with paired water and sediment sample collection at 18 locations during four seasons in Lake Balihe, a subtropical shallow fish-farming lake in mid-eastern China. Pelagic and benthic bacterial communities were distinctly different in terms of diversity, taxonomic composition and community structure, with Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria dominating lake water, and Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria dominating sediment. Nevertheless, these two communities had stronger spatial concordance and overlap in taxa during spring and autumn seasons. Together, the main drivers of both the spatial and temporal variations in Lake Balihe bacterial communities were identified as water temperature, turbidity, nitrogen and phosphorus availability, and thermal stratification controlled by wind-mixing and activity of the dense farmed fish populations. Notably, populations affiliated with Firmicutes, known to be abundant in fish gut microbiome, were especially abundant in the summer season and locations where high fish biomass was found, suggesting a potential link between fish gut microbiome and the pelagic bacterial communities.

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Interspecific variation in the response of fish to anthropogenic noise,"Elevated levels of anthropogenic noise, especially those observed through boating activity, can negatively impact fish species, but it remains unclear which species are most affected and which behavioural metrics are best used in assessing fish responses to underwater noise. The effects of boat sounds on freshwater species are of particular interest because freshwater environments are less studied than the marine realm despite comparably high levels of biodiversity. In the current study, we examine the behavioural responses to boat noise in two freshwater species that differ in their hypothesised response to sound inputs: the spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius), a species with known hearing specialisations, and the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), a species with more generalised hearing capabilities. Fish were presented with boat noise in a laboratory setting, and their swimming, escape and foraging behaviours were assessed to examine differential responses in relation to hypothesised hearing abilities. Both species showed a decrease in general swimming behaviours but an increase in erratic movements in response to boat noise, indicative of stress responses for both species. Despite the similarities in response based on swimming behaviours however, only spottail shiners exhibited true escape responses to the onset of the noise stimulus, suggesting a more extreme reaction in the species with a more refined hearing ability. Taken together, these results show that freshwater fish can respond to increased levels of anthropogenic noise, but that the severity of the response may differ based on auditory structures and therefore presumed hearing ability. The differences seen between behavioural metrics used (swimming vs. escape responses) also demonstrate how care must be taken in choosing a metric when developing exposure guidelines for underwater sound exposures, as different metrics could lead to differential impact assessments.",anthropogenic noise; fish behaviour; fish hearing; sensory ecology; underwater acoustics,2023,68,1,10.1111/fwb.14006,0046-5070,10,70,283,1966,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Modelling the longitudinal distribution, abundance, and habitat use of the giant freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium spinipes) in a large intermittent, tropical Australian river to inform water resource policy","Water development threatens rivers and their biodiversity. Amphidromous shrimp are particularly vulnerable as they require migration between freshwater and estuaries to complete their life cycle. The Fitzroy River is a large tropical intermittent river undergoing water development that is home to the amphidromous shrimp Macrobrachium spinipes (cherabin), yet little is known about its habitat use and flow-ecology making it difficult to inform sustainable water-take. We investigated habitat associations, distributional patterns suggestive of amphidromy, and the influence of water availability by sampling main channel and floodplain pools along a 350-km river length during 2 contrasting flow years. Applying a size-specific abundance model, we estimated abundance per size class, site, and year. We then predicted abundance at the landscape scale with remotely sensed water to reveal the impact of water availability on the meta-population. Our model revealed that juveniles were in greatest abundance in downstream main channel pools, whereas adults were in greatest abundance in upstream floodplain pools. Abundance varied by year with lower numbers predicted in the low-flow year. Longitudinal and habitat patterns remained when our pool-level results were scaled to the landscape, and the positive relationship of abundance to wet-season flow was strengthened. The predominance of smaller cherabin in the lower reaches of the river provides indirect support for an estuarine nursery and amphidromous life history; however, small individuals observed in landlocked pools, during late dry season suggests possible within-river recruitment. The importance of water development policies that protect wet-season flow and passage along the Fitzroy River is supported by this work. These types of policies are likely to be important for this and other amphidromous shrimp species across Australia, Southeast Asia and further afield.

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Patterns in aquatic metacommunities are associated with environmental and trait heterogeneity,"Metacommunities are structured by a combination of different ecological factors that vary in their importance depending on environmental heterogeneity and species functional equivalence. However, empirical tests of such context-dependence at regional scales are still missing. We investigated associations between deterministic (e.g. environmental filtering and biotic interactions) and stochastic factors (e.g. dispersal related) and metacommunity structure of macroinvertebrates and diatoms across streams in four regions with contrasting levels of environmental and organismal trait heterogeneity. Environmental filtering was most strongly associated with the region that showed moderate environmental heterogeneity and comprised communities with the highest trait heterogeneity. Associations with stochastic factors in the regions were more variable and difficult to predict. Environmental factors and the degree of genus-level association were generally more strongly associated with macroinvertebrates than with diatoms, whereas stochastic factors had consistently lower influence on macroinvertebrates. These results suggest that the degree to which deterministic versus stochastic factors influence aquatic metacommunities depends on environmental and trait heterogeneity. Furthermore, organismal characteristics such as dispersal potential, habitat specialisation and sensitivity to environmental variation can also generate considerable context dependency in metacommunity structure.",biotic interactions; context dependency; dispersal potential; ecological stochasticity; environmental filtering,2023,68,1,10.1111/fwb.14011,0046-5070,11,93,180,1493,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Scale-dependence of fish habitat associations in a North American river system,"Determining the appropriate measurement scale to assess habitat variables is critical for ecologists assessing biological or ecological conditions. Depth, velocity, substrate, woody debris and other fish cover variables occur on both reach and microhabitat scales, and fish habitat associations with these variables may be scale-dependent. The aim of this work was to better understand the importance of scale for fish-habitat associations with these variables in a framework consistent with environmental filtering and to test the hypothesis that habitat variable importance is scale-dependent. I used prepositioned areal electrofishing in wadeable streams of the Delaware River basin to evaluate the associations of fish with the same variables summarised on different reach and microhabitat scales. The importance of scale for fish-habitat associations was assessed using two approaches that approximate an environmental filtering framework: variance partitioning with (1) ordination and (2) generalised linear mixed models. Variables on both the reach and microhabitat scales explained a significant fraction of the total variation in fish community composition (p < 0.05). Variation decomposition of reach- and microhabitat-scale effects revealed 20.2\% and 2.0\% of all variation were due uniquely to reach and microhabitat scales, respectively. Measures of coarseness, embeddedness, amount of riffle and areal coverage of five fish cover variables were significant explanatory variables of community composition at the reach scale only (p < 0.05). Velocity and mesohabitat (amount or presence of riffle) were the only two habitat features that were significant explanatory variables of fish community composition at both the reach and microhabitat scales (p < 0.05). Individual models of species occurrence revealed similar patterns as seen with analyses of community composition. For many fishes, habitat features quantified at the reach scale were more explanatory than at the microhabitat scale. Longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae) were more dependent upon microhabitat variables than reach-scale variables, relative to other fishes. Mean velocity at the reach scale was the most important explanatory variable for explaining fish community composition and indicated support for the concept of environmental filtering at the reach and microhabitat scales. Few studies of fish occurrence have incorporated a study design and analytical framework that approximates the hierarchical nature of habitat. This study identifies important scales and predictors, demonstrates the importance of a multiscale approach, and provides support for the environmental filtering concept at the reach and microhabitat scales. These findings will allow ecologists to better account for scale-dependent habitat associations and justify the use of fish habitat associations on reach and microhabitat scales for assessing biotic integrity, restoration and conservation of fishes.",environmental filtering; microhabitat; prepositioned areal electrofishing; reach; scale; wadeable streams,2023,68,1,10.1111/fwb.14005,0046-5070,11,78,414,2969,6,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Body stores of emergent aquatic insects are associated with body size, sex, swarming behaviour and dispersal strategies","Dispersal is a determining step in the life cycle of insects and a key factor of their energy budget. If the body stores of terrestrial insects are relatively well-documented, those of merolimnic insects (i.e., with aquatic larvae and terrestrial winged adults) remain poorly investigated. We assayed the body stores (protein, carbohydrate and lipid contents) of 18 families of merolimnic insects, encompassing a wide diversity of biological and ecological traits. We highlighted allometry between body stores and mass. The proportion of triglyceride and free carbohydrate relatively decreases with an increase in absolute insect mass, whereas protein and glycogen contents are proportional. We found a significant effect of insect order, Diptera having relatively more proteins than Trichoptera. For swarming taxa, males have relatively more triglycerides than their conspecific female. Passive dispersers are characterised by higher protein and glycogen contents Each body store was associated with specific life-history traits, emphasising the importance of considering each body store independently to better understand the associated functions. Dispersal strategies seem to be the main structuring factor underlying body store patterns of merolimnic insects, being significantly associated with the variation in adjusted triglycerides (30\%), proteins (21\%), glycogen (29\%) and free carbohydrates (17\%). However, our study estimated the role of flight only indirectly through the biological traits of insects. Future works should focus on identifying which substrates are used for flight, by comparing the proportion of body stores before and after flight, as well as protein identification to distinguish proteins associated with flight or reproduction.

Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are key macronutrients in aquatic systems. Excess nutrients benefit some algal groups over others. We paired a nutrient-diffusing substrata limitation experiment with high performance liquid chromatography to (a) identify which nutrient(s) limit periphyton production, and (b) how the periphyton biomass and community structure changes between isolated pools of differing hydrological characteristics along an intermittent dryland stream. Unique peaks for 21 pigments were identified and matched with published values. We then produced a PERMANOVA model using pigment ratios and CHEMTAX analysis to explore changes in community structure resulting from nutrient addition. Periphyton communities in these pools were co-limited by N and P. Nitrogen additions caused the periphyton to shift from diatom- to chlorophyte-dominated community structure and benefited cyanophyta growth. Phosphorus additions reduced the relative proportion of diatoms and also resulted in an increase in pheophoribide-a, a pigment indicative of cell lysis, demonstrating a detrimental impact of P additions. Outcomes of this study show that when adding nutrient to a system there may be subtle shifts in community composition which can be telescoped up the food web regardless of the system's nutrient status.",algae; intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams; nitrogen; nutrient limitation; phosphorus; pigment analysis,2022,67,12,10.1111/fwb.14002,0046-5070,15,119,204,1440,6,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes

Where stream flows are dominated by snow melt in western North America, climate change has resulted in peak flows that occur earlier in the runoff season and reduced flows during the non-runoff season. Such changes can negatively affect the reproduction success and first-year survival of stream-dependent, autumn-spawning salmonid fishes. We annually sampled bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus Suckley) populations in the St. Mary River catchment in north-central Montana, U.S.A. Bull trout (>= age 3; n = 3,502) electrofished from six creeks during 1998-2018 were given passive integrated transponder tags and 739 (21.1\%) of those fish were recaptured through 2019 (tag loss c. 4.5\%). We used tag-recapture data to (1) determine the spatial extent of the bull trout metapopulation; (2) fit a Bayesian Jolly-Seber model to identify the temporal trends in the sizes, finite growth rates (lambda), and apparent survival and detection probabilities of the three main populations; and (3) assess the statistical associations between lambda and flow. Bull trout movements among creeks defined the metapopulation's almost catchment-wide spatial extent. Statistical correlations between lambda and flow were clumped in the month x flow variable space at flow lags of 3-7 years, which corresponded with production of the dominant age classes in our tagged populations. Positive correlations occurred during June-September (the bull trout spawning season) and negative correlations during October-May (the embryo-incubation period). Declining spawning-season flow could have degraded bull trout spawning habitat, whereas increasing incubation-period flow could have physically disturbed embryos affecting their survival. This study revealed associations between bull trout population dynamics and climate change as indexed by stream flow. Although the spawning habitats of these bull trout are protected within Glacier National Park and the occurrence of multiple local populations supports metapopulation persistence, that persistence is diminished because flow-regime change has a strong negative influence on each population. Given the region's apparent climate trajectory, further decline in the bull trout metapopulation is anticipated.",hydrologic regime shift; incubation habitat; migratory life history; recruitment; spawning habitat,2022,NA,NA,10.1111/fwb.14025,0046-5070,18,142,321,2297,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Contrasting short- and long-term outcomes of pairwise interactions between caddisflies at a hydrologically heterogeneous range margin,"Climate change is leading many species to shift their geographical ranges. Species undergoing these range shifts often are moving into areas with heterogeneous abiotic conditions. Additionally, these range-shifting species will encounter resident species with whom they will compete for space and/or resources. However, the ways that these abiotic and biotic factors interact to influence the establishment and persistence of range-shifting species has received little attention. Here, we conduct an in situ cage experiment examining how a local wetland hydroperiod gradient (i.e., temporary and semi-permanent ponds) and competition with a resident caddisfly species, Asynarchus nigriculus, influences the survival of the range-shifting species Limnephilus picturatus. We then use long-term survey data of population densities of these two species to determine whether pairwise interactions observed in the cage experiment translated into long-term dynamics. The cage experiment revealed that A. nigriculus had a strong, negative effect on the survival of the range-shifting species L. picturatus, regardless of hydroperiod. However, we observed no relationship between the densities or occurrence of L. picturatus and A. nigriculus in long-term data for either temporary or semi-permanent ponds. Our results suggest that landscape-level abiotic heterogeneity at range margins may not always be important for mediating antagonistic interactions between resident and range-shifting species. However, although an interaction appears ecologically significant in short-term field studies, broader context is needed to understand whether those types of interactions mediate species' distributions and abundance through time. At face-value, our results from the field experiment and long-term data analysis did not align. This suggests that other factors such as additional competitive or trophic interactions may be more important drivers behind the population dynamics of this range-shifting species at its new upper-elevational limit.",competition; range-shifts; species interactions; temporal dynamics; Trichoptera,2022,NA,NA,10.1111/fwb.14017,0046-5070,16,133,277,2032,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Distribution patterns of macrophytes in shallow lakes of the lower Parana River floodplain: Associations with environmental conditions,"Macrophytes play key functional and structural roles in floodplain shallow lakes (SL), determining the maintenance of ecosystem functions and sustaining several productive activities. We assessed the relationship between macrophyte community structure (composition, species abundance, and plant diversity) and environmental features (SL dynamics, connectivity, morphometry, flood frequency, and water and sediment physical and chemical variables) in the Lower Parana River floodplain. Our main hypothesis was that SL macrophyte distribution depends on direct and indirect environmental controls operating at multiple scales. The SL dynamics during the April-November 2017 Parana River pulse were described according to their coverage changes (vegetation, and turbid or clear open water), which were assessed with supervised classifications on Landsat 8-OLI scenes. Twenty-five SL of the Lower Parana River floodplain were selected to represent all the SL dynamics identified. Ten SL were permanently connected and 15 were disconnected from watercourses. Water and sediment physical and chemical characteristics, macrophyte assemblage composition, and plant species abundance were surveyed at each site in the 2018 summer. Also, SL morphometric parameters and flood frequency were estimated from ancillary geographic data. The direct controlling factors of macrophyte assemblages were water ammonium and water nitrate concentrations, turbidity, and flood frequency. No clear effects of environmental conditions on macrophyte diversity were found. The connectivity of SL with watercourses affected their water and sediment physical and chemical features. Also, SL dynamics during the 2017 pulse were related to flood frequency. As connectivity to watercourses affects SL chemical and physical variables, and SL dynamics were associated with flood frequency, connectivity and SL dynamics indirectly influenced macrophyte assemblage composition. This study improved our understanding of macrophyte distribution patterns in the study area, which was related to several environmental variables operating at different scales. Our results highlight the importance of the variability of hydrological connectivity in promoting environmental heterogeneity in river floodplain systems, which is central to their functioning, and the high biodiversity that characterises these environments.",aquatic vegetation; connectivity; environmental constraints; freshwater wetlands; Parana River delta,2022,67,12,10.1111/fwb.13999,0046-5070,17,134,317,2377,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Ecological and habitat preferences of diatoms in lakes of Lutzow-Holm Bay, East Antarctica","Lakes and ponds along the Antarctic coastline provide an opportunity for palaeoclimate reconstructions to complement ice core records from the interior of the continent, including via their diatom records. Diatom palaeoecological studies in remote Antarctica are partially undermined by uncertainty concerning the relative influence of climate, water quality and substrate on diatom species assemblages. The relative abundance and distribution of diatoms across a range of substrates and water depths were analysed from nine lakes in the coastal ice-free regions of Lutzow-Holm Bay, East Antarctica. Specific conductivity and sample position (whether from the shallow, littoral zone, or from deeper parts of the lake) were identified as significant variables in explaining diatom distribution, using non-metric multidimensional scaling and regression tree analysis to identify statistically significant groupings of diatom assemblages and associated environmental variables. In contrast to the significant difference between the diatom assemblages from the shallow littoral region and the lake floor at most sites, the diatom flora from different substrates in the littoral zone were not significantly different, which may be related to the extent of ice cover. Humodophila australis was the most common species in the lakes with lowest specific conductivity, whereas Halamphora vyvermaniana was associated with lake-floor habitats and Psammothidium papilio with samples from littoral zones at several sites. These observations hold significance for the interpretation of lake sediment diatom assemblages in Lutzow-Holm Bay as archives of past climate and indicate that sampling strategies should consider a range of locations in lakes, with samples from the lake floor prioritised for the interpretation of sediment core diatom records.",algae; climate; ecology; Lake salinity; Palaeolimnology; polar region,2022,67,12,10.1111/fwb.14000,0046-5070,13,90,258,1837,6,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Effects of land use change on inter-species and intra-guild trophic interactions of fish communities in tropical headwater streams,"Freshwater ecosystems are subjected to a broad range of anthropogenic threats. Understanding the responses of aquatic biota to these threats and identifying potential mitigating actions presents a major challenge for ecologists and natural resource managers. Here, we investigated the responses of fish communities to land use change at different scales. We assessed patterns of food web structure of fish across a gradient of human impacts in the Atlantic Forest ecoregion of southeast Brazil. We analysed stomach contents of fish and evaluated the response of five food web metrics to variation in land use change. We also calculated four metrics for intra-guild comparisons in the omnivore, insectivore, and algivore-insectivore guilds. The proportional abundance of omnivores increased as temperature increased and canopy cover decreased. Food web specialisation decreased in deforested streams with higher nutrient input, suggesting higher resource sharing by those fish communities. Fish in the algivore-insectivore guild consumed fewer types of macroinvertebrates in streams with low canopy cover. The opposite pattern was observed within the insectivore guild with individuals consuming a larger variety of prey in impacted streams. Deforestation, and increases in water temperature and nutrient input, influenced inter-species and intra-guild trophic interactions in fish communities in these Atlantic Forest streams, even though the richness of fish community and composition of intra-guild species remained unchanged. Some food web metrics were sensitive to the direct and indirect effects of disturbance on these fish communities. Our study has shown that assessments of trophic interactions can detect the effects of land-use disturbance on fish communities that may not be evident from simple measures of species richness and composition. This approach provides direct insights into the functional integrity of fish communities and should be considered for monitoring the success of programmes aimed to protect and, where necessary, restore freshwater ecosystems.",food webs; human impacts; resource partitioning; riparian zone; trophic ecology; tropical streams,2022,67,12,10.1111/fwb.13995,0046-5070,18,130,295,2077,6,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Fish community composition in small lakes: The impact of lake genesis and fisheries management,"1. Gravel pit lakes are common across Europe. These novel ecosystems serve as model systems to study human-induced and natural colonisation of isolated lakes by fish. Fisheries-management activities can quickly spread species over large distances, possibly homogenising fish communities across ecosystems, while fostering local fish diversity. 2. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of lake genesis (gravel pit lakes < 100 years old vs. natural lakes of glacial genesis similar to 10,000 years old) and fisheries management (fish stocking activities present vs. absent) on the fish community in small lakes, while controlling for key environmental variables known to affect lake fish communities. 3. We sampled fish communities by electrofishing and multimesh gillnetting in 47 isolated lakes managed for fisheries, and 19 unmanaged and isolated lakes of both natural and artificial origin in northern Germany. Unmanaged lakes were used as reference to assess fisheries-management impacts in small natural and artificial lakes. 4. We caught 178,506 fish from 30 species and found that the accumulation of native lake fish species in lakes was associated with fisheries management, which increased local species richness (alpha-diversity) and number of predatory species, and reduced among-lake variation in fish community composition (beta-diversity; i.e., homogenisation). The homogenisation-effect associated with fisheries happened with introduced native fish species, whereas non-native species were rarely detected. 5. In unmanaged gravel pit lakes, the littoral fish community composition was substantially different to the communities present in both types of managed lakes and unmanaged natural lakes. Therefore, the relatively young unmanaged gravel pit lakes revealed evidence of ongoing, stochastic colonisation processes that resulted in comparatively species-poor fish communities. 6. We concluded that fisheries management by anglers speeds up the colonisation of gravel pit lakes with native fish species in the study area. For planning initial fish introductions in newly created gravel pit lakes, it is recommended that fish communities from ecologically similar natural lakes within the same geographical region are used as references to maintain the biotic integrity of newly created fish communities.",biodiversity; fish assemblage; fish colonisation; gravel pit lake; lake origin; quarry lake; stocking,2022,67,12,10.1111/fwb.14001,0046-5070,14,94,330,2326,7,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Fish movements in response to environmental flow releases in intermittent rivers,"Variation in river flow is a strong behavioural determinant for the movement of many freshwater fish species and often is linked to key aspects of their life cycle. The alteration of natural flow regimes to meet human water demands can result in changes to this variability, and cause declines in water-dependent biota. Environmental flows are used as a remediation tool in some regulated rivers with the intention of restoring aspects of the natural flow regime to benefit riverine species, although empirical data are required to inform the efficacy of these interventions. Using acoustic telemetry, we quantified the movement responses of two large-bodied native fish species (freshwater catfish, Tandanus tandanus and Murray cod, Maccullochella peelii) to variations in river flow over 4 years in two intermittent regulated rivers in the northern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. Both rivers received periodic environmental flow releases and also there were several large natural flow events during the study period. Both species displayed a range of intra-specific movement behaviours. Analysis of individuals' movements revealed five distinct functional groups, which were represented in both species. We found that periods of environmental flow delivery played an important role in the movement behaviour of both species. Murray cod were more likely to move during periods of environmental flow releases, whereas freshwater catfish were less likely to move on an environmental release following higher antecedent flows. No large-scale philopatric movements were observed, yet Murray cod were more likely to move during the breeding period, indicative of nest site selection. We also found that the likelihood of movement in both species was higher in the smaller of the two rivers for a given magnitude of flow. Our results suggest that environmental flows may benefit certain fish species by facilitating, rather than cueing breeding behaviours, allowing individuals improved access to, and provision of, higher-quality nesting habitats. These findings will aid water managers in creating economical and targeted environmental flow releases, timing larger flow pulses for the species with flow-cued reproductive strategies, and providing a continuity of smaller baseflows for species whose reproduction is not dependent on flow cues but may be enhanced by greater connectivity.",acoustic telemetry; environmental flow; flow regime; movement ecology; river regulation,2022,NA,NA,10.1111/fwb.14022,0046-5070,11,80,352,2385,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Flow intermittency affects structural and functional properties of macroinvertebrate communities in alpine streams,"Flow regime is a major determinant of the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Under climate change, flow intermittency is becoming more prevalent in glaciated alpine catchments, but the effects of increasing dryness on aquatic biodiversity remain largely unknown. We characterised flow intermittency patterns in 30 streams of a glaciated alpine catchment over 15 months and separated these streams into four intermittency categories: perennial streams, winter-drying streams, moderately intermittent streams with occasional drying in summer, and periodically intermittent streams with extensive dry periods throughout the year. We then examined how these drying patterns affected structural and functional properties of benthic macroinvertebrate communities, and whether these changes were primarily deterministic or stochastic. At the taxonomic level, we observed a response at the highest intermittency levels, with alpha diversity lower and beta diversity higher in periodically intermittent streams than in other stream types. This result suggested that local biota were well adapted to intermediate intermittency levels (mostly during winter) but not to high intermittency during summer. In contrast, functional diversity indices at the alpha and beta levels (based on trait abundances) did not differ across intermittency categories. Considering the moderate level of functional redundancy, we interpreted this as an indication that changes in taxonomic diversity may have resulted primarily from stochastic processes. Analysis of community and trait composition indicated that deterministic selection may indeed have occurred with increased intermittency, but this process was likely to be minor in comparison to stochastic extinctions. Notably, community evenness was highest in periodically intermittent streams and lowest in perennial streams, suggesting that frequent drying prevented competitive exclusion. Our results suggested that most macroinvertebrate populations are resilient to intermediate intermittency levels but are filtered at high intermittency, irrespective of their resilience capacities. However, more research is needed to clarify the specific roles of different facets of flow regimes, specifically frequency, duration, and timing of intermittency. Understanding the consequences of responses in diversity and community evenness with increasing intermittency on the functional properties of communities will allow better prediction of the future ecological status of alpine stream networks to ongoing environmental change.",alpine streams; aquatic insects; diversity; functional traits; intermittency,2022,NA,NA,10.1111/fwb.14018,0046-5070,13,114,344,2566,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Food quality and exposure time affect induced defences in Daphnia: Based on key morphology, life history traits, and expression of related genes","Kairomone-induced anti-predation defences in zooplankton mediate trophic interactions in aquatic ecosystems. Changes in food quality greatly affect induced defences because of the potential influence on resource allocation. Understanding how zooplankton respond to predation risk under poor nutrition conditions is critical for predicting ecosystem function. The present study focused on the fish kairomone-induced defences in Daphnia pulex fed unicellular non-toxic Microcystis aeruginosa. Transcriptions of key genes were detected to interpret changes in morphological and life history traits. Additionally, the degree of responsiveness of traits to increasing proportions of M. aeruginosa in the diet was compared at different endpoints with varied exposure duration. Daphnia pulex decreased body size but showed an elongated tail spine as morphological adaptations to the presence of fish kairomones, supported by enhanced transcriptions of chitin deacetylase and cuticle protein genes. However, with suppressed expression of the related genes, tail spine length was linearly reduced by increasing proportions of M. aeruginosa in the diet, accompanied by decreased somatic growth and reproduction. Presence of fish kairomones interactively affected the inhibitive effects of increasing proportions of M. aeruginosa in the diet on Daphnia growth, reproduction, and tail spine defence but not body size. In addition, the magnitude of effects of M. aeruginosa on Daphnia growth and morphological responses under fish kairomone exposure was increased with the increasing length of exposure time from 3-7 days (reaching maturity) to 14 days (by the end of tests), indicating an aggravated inhibitive effect of M. aeruginosa on induced defences over time. The present study provides references for evaluating zooplankton-fish interactions under poor nutrition conditions. Since a cyanobacterial bloom may last from a few weeks to several months, experiments involving the whole life span of zooplankton are thought to fully reveal the actual impact of cyanobacteria on interspecific interactions related to zooplankton. In addition, unifying the exposure time to cyanobacteria for comparative studies is recommended in future research.",cyanobacteria; gene expression; inducible defence; predation; zooplankton,2022,NA,NA,10.1111/fwb.14023,0046-5070,22,144,312,2233,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Interactions between microbial activity and bioturbation modes of benthic invertebrates determine nutrient releases from reservoir sediments,"Bioturbating invertebrates play key roles in nutrient recycling from sediments to the water column in most lentic ecosystems. Nevertheless, the role of bioturbating fauna on nutrient cycling depends on complex interactions between their bioturbation modes and both the sedimentary conditions and the microbial activity occurring inside sediments. This study aims to evaluate the effect of different bioturbation modes by two invertebrate species (tubificid worm Tubifex tubifex and chironomid larvae of Chironomus plumosus), on the release of nutrients (NH4+, NO3-, and PO43-) from three different types of sediments characterised by distinct microbial activities and nutrient (N and P) contents. We expected that the influence of a bioturbation mode on nutrient fluxes was dependent on the microbial activity and organic matter processes occurring in sediments. Aquatic mesocosms were setup in the laboratory with three fauna treatments (i.e. without fauna, with tubificid worms, and with chironomid larvae) and three sediment types (collected in three reservoirs). The presence of bioturbating invertebrates increased PO43- concentrations into the water column (from 1.3- to 17-fold higher concentrations) depending on the sediments tested. PO43- releases in the water column were positively linked to total P concentration and microbial activity in sediments. The influences of tubificid worms and chironomid larvae on PO43- releases into the water were not only due to their bioturbation modes but also depended on the interactions with P dynamics (e.g. adsorption of PO43- by iron oxides) at the water-sediment interface. The influence of fauna on the release of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) varied strongly among sediments due to the control of N cycling by microbial processes. In sediments characterised by the lowest microbial activity, DIN release from sediments to the water column was significantly stimulated by invertebrates (from 1.3- to 3.7-fold higher). In contrast, no fauna effect was detected compared to controls in sediments characterised by the highest microbial activity. This study demonstrated that the influence of the bioturbation mode on nutrient (i.e. PO43- and DIN) dynamics at the water sediment interface was largely modulated by the intensity of microbial activity and biogeochemical processes occurring in sediments.",bioturbation functional groups; chironomid; microbial respiration; tubificid; water-sediment interface,2022,NA,NA,10.1111/fwb.14021,0046-5070,16,140,342,2357,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Neglected symbionts and other metazoan invertebrates associated with molluscs from Africa's largest lake: Diversity, biotic interactions and bioindication","Freshwater molluscs are hosts for diverse metazoan symbionts. However, apart from the digenean helminths, symbionts of molluscs are underreported worldwide. Therefore, this study focused on the diversity of oligochaetes, leeches, mites, insect larvae and nematodes associated with gastropods and bivalves from Lake Victoria, East Africa. Overall, 1,633 mollusc specimens representing 14 species were sampled from the Kenyan part of the lake. Each host specimen was examined to determine co-occurrence of symbionts (including digeneans) and other metazoan invertebrates, and their microhabitat preferences on/in the hosts. In addition, prevalence and abundance of symbionts were compared for molluscs obtained from an unpolluted site, and sites that are eutrophic and polluted with heavy metals. In total, 33 species were recovered from the molluscs: six oligochaetes, four insects, two mites, two nematodes, one leech and 18 digeneans. The nematode Daubaylia potomaca, mite Unionicola macani, leech Batracobdelloides sp., oligochaetes Chaetogaster limnaei, Dero digitata, Aulophorus africanus, Allonais paraguayensis and Ophidonais serpentina, and gorgoderid digenean larvae are new records for Lake Victoria. Moreover, the genus Bratislavia (Oligochaeta) is reported for the first time in Africa. Our results show that parasitic mites and leeches were absent from mollusc specimens that harboured chironomids. Likewise, there was no co-occurrence of C. limnaei, D. potomaca and digeneans, suggesting that antagonistic interactions occur between the symbionts. Although co-occurrence of mites and digeneans in individual mollusc hosts was common, the symbionts occupied different microhabitats. This study shows that prevalence and intensities of U. macani and C. limnaei, were significantly higher in hosts from the unpolluted site, compared with the polluted sites. What is more, D. potomaca and trichopteran larvae, were recorded only from the unpolluted site. The distribution of the chironomid Kiefferulus chloronatus suggests their preference for sites that are rich in organic matter and their ability to tolerate pollution. Information on antagonistic interactions between symbionts might be applicable in biocontrol, especially of digenean species that have veterinary or medical importance. Finally, this study shows a potential for the use of U. macani, C. limnaei, D. potomaca and insect larvae as discriminators of the quality of aquatic habitats.",bioindicator; competitive exclusion; co-occurrence; Lake Victoria; pollution effect,2022,67,12,10.1111/fwb.13998,0046-5070,18,154,344,2460,5,NA,500,5,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,Antarctic biodiversity predictions through substrate qualities and environmental DNA,"Antarctic conservation science is crucial for enhancing Antarctic policy and understanding alterations to terrestrial Antarctic biodiversity. Antarctic conservation will have limited long-term impacts in the absence of large-scale biodiversity data, but if such data were available, it is likely to improve environmental protection regimes. To enable the prediction of Antarctic biodiversity across continental spatial scales through proxy variables, in the absence of baseline surveys, we linked Antarctic substrate-derived environmental DNA (eDNA) sequence data from the remote Antarctic Prince Charles Mountains to a selected range of concomitantly collected measurements of substrate properties. We achieved this through application of a statistical method commonly used in machine learning. Our analysis indicated that neutral substrate pH, low conductivity, and certain substrate minerals are important predictors of the presence of basidiomycetes, chlorophytes, ciliophorans, nematodes, and tardigrades. A bootstrapped regression revealed how variations in the identified substrate parameters influence probabilities of detecting eukaryote phyla across vast and remote areas of Antarctica.

Frequent megafires reflect changes to fire regimes that can negatively impact species and ecosystems. Here, we offer what we believe to be the first comprehensive analysis of megafire impacts on southeastern Australian vegetation communities, combining remote-sensing data, fire-history records, and plant trait-derived fire interval thresholds. In our study area, fires burned over 5.5 million ha. We found that one-third of all native vegetation in this region has burned too frequently following the megafires, particularly impacting fire-sensitive vegetation (for example, rainforests). This represents a single-year increase of 36\% in the vegetation at risk of interval squeeze (vegetation transitions driven by altered fire regimes) compared to the previous 59 years combined. We demonstrate that megafires can overrun recently burned vegetation and infiltrate refugia, reducing fire intervals beyond the persistence thresholds of plant species and increasing the risk of ecosystem collapse. Averting this will require innovative approaches to fire management. However, if climate change is not addressed, ecosystem collapse may be unavoidable especially for ecosystems adapted to infrequent, high-severity fire.",NA,2022,20,5,10.1002/fee.2482,1540-9295,8,74,184,1331,NA,NA,150,NA,No,175,125,yes,no,yes
FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Above- and below-ground responses to experimental climate forcing in two forb species from montane wooded pastures in Switzerland,"Mountain ecosystems are particularly threatened by ongoing climate change and the species composition of high elevation grasslands is already changing. An open research question is how these ecosystems will adapt to changes in their key environmental constraints. The responses of wooded pastures to experimental climate forcing were analysed in a transplantation experiment conducted downslope, along an elevational temperature and precipitation gradient on the lee side of Jura Mountains, Switzerland (up to +4.17 degrees C and -35\% precipitation). To improve mechanistic understanding of biodiversity and biomass decreases in response to transplantation, changes in functional traits within foliage and roots of one ubiquitous (Taraxacum officinale) and one montane (Alchemilla monticola) perennial forb species were investigated. In consequence of transplantation, the two studied species raised their temperature optimum for CO2 assimilation and net photosynthesis yield from 20 to 30 degrees C. During cool periods, the highest rates of leaf gas exchanges were measured at the lower recipient sites. However, an opposite trend was observed during a spring drought and summer warm spell. Regarding the more integrative morpho-anatomical traits, Alchemilla primarily acclimated to warmer temperatures at the recipient sites with increased leaf and foliage rosette size. Missing xeromorphic and/or hydraulic adjustments in foliage and roots, its susceptibility to higher vapour pressure deficits and lower soil moisture availability was thus enhanced. Taraxacum showed adjustments to both warmer temperature and lower moisture availability, including reduced leaf size, lower hydraulic diameter of xylem vessels and theoretical specific hydraulic conductivity. The anticipated shift in the environmental conditions at high elevation, with reduced coldness limitation but increasingly constraining water economy, could thus become particularly demanding for montane species of wooded pastures. It may favour perennials with large phenotypic plasticity but leads to maladjustments and loss of the species which are more specifically adapted to montane conditions.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,An extended epiphenotype for an extended phenotype in Toxoplasma gondii infected feral house mice,"Parasitism of mice by Toxoplasma gondii reduces the host's aversion to cat odours, likely increasing predation and transmission of the parasite to its definitive host. This behavioural change suggests a parasitic manipulation where host behaviour becomes an extended phenotype of the parasite. Independently, epigenetic changes within an organism are now known to create behavioural change. The results described here provide an experimental connection between these disparate strands of extended phenotypes and the role of epigenetics in behavioural diversity. Using mice captured on Kangaroo Island in Australia, we demonstrate that Toxoplasma gondii infection leads to specific DNA hypomethylation events in the host brain. Previous laboratory studies have shown that these epigenetic changes underlie the central processing of cat odours. We posit that the concept of extended phenotype can be expanded to extended epiphenotype, thus linking parasite genes to host behaviour through epigenesis.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Bird extinctions threaten to cause disproportionate reductions of functional diversity and uniqueness,"Human activities are driving rapid defaunation of Earth's ecosystems through increasing rates of extinction. However, the ecological consequences of species loss remain unclear, in part due to the limited availability of high-resolution functional trait data. To address this, we assess how predicted extinctions will reshape avian functional diversity quantified using a multidimensional trait space, or morphospace, reflecting variation in eight key morphological traits closely linked to ecological function across 9943 (>99\%) extant bird species. We show that large regions of this morphospace are represented by very few species and, thus, vulnerable to species loss. We also find evidence that species at highest risk of extinction are both larger and functionally unique in terms of ecological trait dimensions unrelated to size, such as beak shape and wing shape. Although raw patterns suggest a positive relationship between extinction risk and functional uniqueness, this is removed when accounting for phylogeny and body mass, indicating a dominant role for clade-specific factors, including the combination of larger average body size and higher extinction risk in the non-passerine clade. Regardless of how a threat is related to uniqueness, we show using simulations that the loss of currently threatened bird species would result in a greater loss of morphological diversity than expected under random extinctions. Our results suggest that ongoing declines of threatened bird species may drive a disproportionately large loss of morphological diversity, with potentially major consequences for ecosystem functioning.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Body shape and mode of propulsion do not constrain routine swimming in coral reef fishes,"It is widely believed that because of biomechanical trade-offs, fish body shape and the mode of propulsion are strong predictors of swimming performance, with the best cruisers, maneuverers and accelerators having different body forms and emphasizing different propulsion mechanisms. This paradigm is regularly projected onto routine swimming behaviour and dominates the ecomorphological literature, despite the paucity of field measurements. In this study, we measured variation in swimming behaviour among 48 species of Indian Ocean coral reef fishes using recordings from a remote stereo video system. We measured average swimming speed, average swimming bout distance, frequency of turns and percent of time spent station-holding and looked for the predicted trade-offs between them. We find little evidence of the expected relationships between swimming behaviours across species, little evidence that body shape affects swimming and few differences between species that swim by undulating the body and those that emphasize the use of median and paired fins. Taxa widely thought of as archetypical maneuverers (Chaetodon) and cruisers (Caranx) were not outliers in any behaviours. Our results indicate that swimming behaviour is not easily predicted from simple measures of body shape and that alternative swimming modes can produce comparable behavioural profiles.",body shape; coral reefs; fish behaviour; fish ecology; locomotion; morphology; propulsion; swimming,2023,37,2,10.1111/1365-2435.14227,0269-8463,15,88,196,1370,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Eco-physiological and morphological traits explain alpine plant species' response to warming,"Understanding the traits mediating species' responses to climate change is a cornerstone for predicting future community composition and ecosystem function. Although species' eco-physiological properties determine their response to environmental change, most trait-based studies focus on a small subset of easily measured morphological traits as proxies for physiology. This choice may limit our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on species' demography, and obscure the underlying mechanisms. We conducted a transplantation experiment along a 1000-m elevation gradient in the Alps to quantify the degree to which changes in plant abundance due to climate warming were predicted by eco-physiological performance versus common morphological traits. Physiological measurements revealed that warming favoured species with a conservative leaf-level water use strategy whereas species whose leaf-level water use was more `wasteful' were more likely to suffer from the warmer and drier climate. Nevertheless, the predictive power of physiological traits did not exceed that of morphological traits. Our results, therefore, show that while easily measured morphological traits can successfully predict plant abundance responses to climate, eco-physiological approaches are needed to understand the underlying mechanism.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Experimental heatwaves disrupt bumblebee foraging through direct heat effects and reduced nectar production,"Heatwaves are an increasingly common extreme weather event across the globe and are projected to surge in frequency and severity in the coming decades. Plant-pollinator mutualisms are vulnerable due to interacting effects of extreme heat on insect pollinator foraging behaviour and their forage plants. We designed an experiment to parse the impact of extreme heat on bumblebee foraging mediated directly through air temperature and indirectly through changes in plant rewards. Temperatures simulating a moderate heatwave negatively impacted foraging bumblebees reducing the proportion of successful foraging bouts, foraging bout duration and plant and flower visitation and indirect stress through reduced nectar production that limited foraging bout duration. Our experimental results provide a mechanistic link between climate, plants and pollinators and suggest in situ conditions from heatwaves could have profound negative consequences for bumblebee colony persistence and maintenance of pollination services.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Implication of the myo-inositol pathway in behavioural alterations of infected threespine sticklebacks,"Threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus infected with the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus display impairments in their anti-predator responses. They also have increased expression of the gene encoding the IMPase 1 enzyme in their brains, which is part of a key step in myo-inositol synthesis. IMPase 1 and myo-inositol levels are the targets of lithium treatment in patients with bipolar disorder. Although promising candidates, we do not know if IMPase 1 and myo-inositol are directly implicated in the changes in risky behaviours measured in Schistocephalus-infected fish. Understanding the molecular mechanisms directly or indirectly involved in these behavioural alterations is crucial to understand the evolution of host-parasite interactions. Here, we increased myo-inositol levels of uninfected fish and inhibited IMPase 1 activity in infected fish to test the prediction that it would decrease and increase their anti-predator behaviour respectively. We found that uninfected fish with increased myo-inositol levels (by injecting exogenous myo-inositol or by inducing endogenous production using an osmotic challenge) did not decrease their anti-predator responses. However, infected fish treated with lithium chloride had some of their anti-predator behaviours restored, but not all. They spent less time swimming close to the surface, showed lowered activity, had a higher latency to feed in a novel environment and spent more time frozen after a predator attack. Our results suggest that the target of lithium treatment is implicated in the risky behaviours of infected fish and supports the idea that the parasite-associated alteration in behaviour has a multifactorial nature.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Indirect effects of trophic interactions govern carbon circulation in two beech forest soil ecosystems,"1. Forest soils harbour a vast array of organisms that govern the processing of organic matter. Through their trophic interactions, they give rise to carbon flows that sustain soil ecosystem functioning. Understanding how soil food webs shape carbon flows may enhance our knowledge about the role of biodiversity on soil processes. 2. In this work, we assembled trophic networks representing soil food webs of two beech forests during spring and autumn, and compiled mass-balanced models quantifying carbon flows between their components. These models were investigated using network analysis to identify the role of the components on carbon flow, cycling and functional trophic relationships. Moreover, we explored how the structure of carbon exchanges promote efficiency and stability. 3. Results indicate the importance of indirect interactions. Most trophic groups exhibit a diffuse dependency on all the compartments for their carbon requirement although certain groups such as Collembola play the role of hubs in distributing carbon. Indirect interactions often reverse the impacts of direct trophic relationships being antagonistic to the direction of change predicted based on predator-prey interactions. The high incidence of generalist feeding habits increases the redundancy of energy channels thereby making such food webs more resilient against perturbations but at the expense of carbon transfer efficiency. 4. Although differences can be observed across sites and periods, food web structure rather than environmental variability seems to be the main factor responsible for patterns of carbon flows in the two beech forests.",carbon flows; ecosystem stability; indirect effects; mass-balance models; microarthropods trophic groups; network analysis; soil food webs; transfer efficiency,2023,37,2,10.1111/1365-2435.14229,0269-8463,14,102,239,1639,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Interspecific and intraspecific trait variability differentially affect community-weighted trait responses to and recovery from long-term drought,"1. Plant traits are useful proxies of plant strategies and can influence community and ecosystem responses to climate extremes, such as severe drought. Few studies, however, have investigated both the immediate and lagged effects of drought on community-weighted mean (CWM) plant traits, with even less re- search on the relative roles of interspecific vs. intraspecific trait variability in such responses. 2. We experimentally reduced growing season precipitation by 66\% in two cold semi arid grassland sites in northern China for four consecutive years to explore the drought resistance of CWM traits as well as their recovery 2 years follow- ing the drought. In addition, we isolated the effects of both interspecific and intraspecific trait variability on shifts in CWM traits. 3. At both sites, we observed significant effects of drought on interspecific and intraspecific trait variability which, in some cases, led to significant changes in CWM traits. For example, drought led to reduced CWM plant height and leaf phosphorous content, but increased leaf carbon content at both sites, with re- sponses primarily due to intraspecific trait shifts. Surprisingly, these CWM traits recovered completely 2 years after the extreme drought. Intraspecific trait vari- ability influenced CWM traits via both positive and negative covariation with interspecific trait variability during drought and recovery phases. 4. These findings highlight the important role of interspecific and intraspecific trait variability in driving the response and recovery of CWM traits following ex- treme, prolonged drought.",climate extreme; environmental filtering; leaf economic spectrum; plant functional traits; plant height; semi-arid grassland,2023,37,3,10.1111/1365-2435.14239,0269-8463,16,145,238,1605,6,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Natural history and ecological effects on the establishment and fate of Florida carpenter ant cadavers infected by the parasitic manipulator Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani,"Ophiocordyceps fungi manipulate the behaviour of their ant hosts to produce a summit disease phenotype, thereby establishing infected ant cadavers onto vegetation at elevated positions suitable for fungal growth and transmission. Multiple environmental and ecological factors have been proposed to shape the timing, positioning and outcome of these manipulations. We conducted a long-term field study of Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani infections of Camponotus floridanus ants-the Florida zombie ants. We propose and refine hypotheses on the factors that shape infection outcomes by tracking the occurrence of and fungal growth from hundreds of ant cadavers. We modelled and report these data in relation to weather, light, vegetation and attack by hyperparasites. We investigated environmental factors that could affect the occurrence and location of newly manipulated ant cadavers. New cadaver occurrence was preferentially biased towards epiphytic Tillandsia bromeliads, canopy openness and summer weather conditions (an interactive effect of temperature, humidity and precipitation). Furthermore, we suggest that incident light at the individual cadaver level reflects microhabitat choice by manipulated ants or selective pressure on cadaver maintenance for conditions that improve fungal survival. We also asked which environmental conditions affect fungal fitness. Continued fungal development of reproductive structures and putative transmission increased with moist weather conditions (interaction of humidity and precipitation) and canopy openness, while being reduced by hyperparasitic mycoparasite infections. Moreover, under the most open canopy conditions, we found an atypical Ophiocordyceps growth morphology that could represent a plastic response to conditions influenced by high light levels. Taken together, we explore general trends and the effects of various ecological conditions on host and parasite disease outcomes in the Florida zombie ant system. These insights from the field can be used to inform experimental laboratory setups that directly test the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on fungus-ant interactions or aim to uncover underlying molecular mechanisms.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Parasitic plants indirectly regulate decomposition of soil organic matter,"Parasitic plants have been shown to affect soil-organic-matter (SOM) decomposition, but the mechanism is unknown. As arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can affect decomposition and compete with parasitic plants for carbon, we hypothesized that parasitic plants can indirectly regulate SOM decomposition by suppressing the effects of AMF on decomposition. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two container experiments in which the herbaceous plant Bidens pilosa was inoculated with the AMF Rhizophagus intraradices or not, and Cuscuta australis or not. In one experiment, we provided SOM within hyphae-in-growth bags as C-13-/(15) N-labelled maize leaves and in the other experiment as phytate-P. We assessed growth and nutrient uptake of B. pilosa, growth of C. australis, the SOM remaining in the hyphae-in-growth bags, and the bacterial communities. Parasitization increased the C-13 and decreased the organic P remaining in the bags, but only in the presence of the extraradical AMF hyphae. AMF decreased the C-13 and increased the organic P remaining in the absence of the parasite, but not in the presence of the parasite. Our results demonstrate that parasitic plants can regulate the decomposition of organic materials indirectly by suppressing the effect of the extraradical AMF hyphae on decomposition. In other words, parasitic plants can regulate SOM decomposition indirectly via a multitrophic cascading effect. Our study helps to unravel the mechanisms of a sophisticated hidden ecological process, and is an important step forward in elucidating the roles of parasitic plants in soil nutrient cycling.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Plant and soil biodiversity is essential for supporting highly multifunctional forests during Mediterranean rewilding,"1. The multidimensional dynamics of biodiversity and ecosystem function during the rewilding of Mediterranean forests remain poorly understood, limiting our capacity to predict how future restoration efforts may help mitigate climate change. 2. Here, we investigated the changes in multiple dimensions of biodiversity and ecosystem services in a 120-year forest succession after harvest to identify potential trade-offs in multiple dimensions of ecosystem function, and further assess the link between above and below-ground biodiversity and function. 3. We found a positive influence of successional age on not only multiple dimensions of biodiversity and function but also some important trade-offs. Two ecosystem axes of function explained nearly 75.4\% of functional variation during ecosystem rewilding. However, while the first axis increased with successional age promoting plant productivity and element stocks, the second axis followed a hump-shaped relationship with age supporting important reductions in nutrient availability and pathogen control in old forests. Our study further revealed a significant positive relationship between plant and soil biodiversity with multiple elements of multifunctionality as forests develop. Moreover, the influence of plant and soil biodiversity were especially important to support a high number of function working at high levels of functioning. 4.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Reduced seed set under water deficit is driven mainly by reduced flower numbers and not by changes in flower visitations and pollination,"Water deficit can alter floral traits with cascading effects on flower-visitor interactions and plant fitness. Water stress induction can diminish productivity, directly resulting in lower flower production and consequently seed set. Changes in floral traits, such as floral scent or reward amount, may in turn alter pollinator visitations and behaviour and consequently can reduce pollination services resulting in lower reproduction output. However, the relative contribution of this indirect in comparison to the direct effects to changes in seed set are not fully understood. We manipulated water availability using rain-out shelters in a field experiment and measured effects on floral scent bouquet, morphology, phenology, flower-visitor interactions, pollination and seed set. Plant individuals of Sinapis arvensis (Brassicaceae) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: mean precipitation (=control), reduced mean precipitation or drought period treatment. Our results show that decreasing water availability lowers the number of flowers and seed set. This indicates a direct link between water stress and seed set, as seed mass increases with increasing flower number. The indirect link of water stress via floral traits, pollinator visits and pollination has weaker effects on seed set. However, floral traits remain relatively stable under decreased water availability, whereas plant growth and flower abundance decrease, potentially in order to allow investment in more resources in fewer flowers to maintain pollination success. Thus, plants are able to compensate for water stress and can maintain floral trait expression, such as a stable scent emission and bouquet, to retain pollinator attraction. These findings indicate that the direct link from water stress to seed set has a stronger impact on plants reproductive success than the indirect link through altered floral trait expression and pollinator visits in a generalist plant species.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Searching while sick: How does disease affect foraging decisions and contact rates?,"Infection often changes an animal's motivation or ability to forage, which should alter rates of contact with uninfected hosts. However, links are likely complex and remain poorly understood. Here, we explore relationships among infection, foraging decisions and contact rates and how these could interact with ecological factors to drive pathogen transmission. Under optimal foraging theory, animals should gather the highest quality resources from a patch, leaving only once the cost of continued foraging outweighs the amount of energy gained. However, the ability to locate and evaluate resources will vary with many factors, including disease, temperature and habitat fragmentation. Although modelling suggests that such variation in foraging decisions can alter contact rates among infected and uninfected hosts, and thus transmission and evolution of infectious agents, empirical studies have only begun to test the direction and strength of such relationships. We propose that foraging behaviour will often change with infection, thereby affecting contact rates, because of sickness behaviours, self-medication, parasite manipulation of the host and nonadaptive behavioural responses to infection. We recommend that future studies empirically test how such associations vary with ambient temperature and habitat fragmentation, as human activity continues to alter these environmental pressures. Furthermore, we suggest that such relationships among infection, foraging and environmental factors could help shape not only population-level disease dynamics, but also surrounding ecological communities. By revealing how environmental factors impact such links, we can improve our understanding and prediction of animal disease dynamics in the face of changing ecosystems.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,The temporal and spatial response of soil fungal community composition and potential function to wildfire in a permafrost region in Canada,"The permafrost regions of the boreal forest store a large amount of carbon, which can be affected by ecological disturbance, especially the interference of forest fires. Understanding the dynamic responses of the post-fire soil fungal community is essential for predicting soil carbon dynamics. We used a post-fire chronosequence (areas with 3, 25, 46 and >100 years post fire {[}ypf]) in Canadian boreal forests with continuous permafrost to examine the responses of fungal communities and fungal genes associated with biogeochemical cycling to fire in the surface and near-surface permafrost layers (0-5, 5-10 and 10-30 cm depth). We hypothesized that as the forest recovers from fire, the fungal communities and functional genes associated with biogeochemical cycling will also recover temporally and spatially, which will in turn affect soil carbon storage. Our results demonstrate that the fire has long-term effects on fungal communities and functions in the surface and near-surface soils. The fungal species richness in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm soil layers increased with time since fire, which required at least 46 years to recover to pre-fire levels. Ascomycota in each of the soil layers in the recently burned area (3 ypf) and ericoid mycorrhizas Oidiodendron maius in the 10-30 cm soil layer in the control area were recognized as indicator taxa. The examination of functional genes revealed that the diversity of potential genes and the expression of genes related to carbon degradation (e.g. chitinase, cellobiase, exoglucanase and endoglucanase) in recently burned area increased in the surface soil, whereas, decreased in the deep soil, suggesting the fire affect the loss of carbon differently in the surface and deep soils in the early stages after fire. In conclusion, the fires significantly altered the fungal communities and functional genes related to carbon storage along the soil vertical gradients and along the post-fire chronosequence.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,Tripartite networks show that keystone species can multitask,"Keystone species are disproportionately important for ecosystem functioning. While all species engage in multiple interaction types with other species, keystone species importance is often defined based on a single dimension of their Eltonian niche, that is, one type of interaction (e.g. keystone predator). It remains unclear whether the importance of keystone species is unidimensional or if it extends across interaction types. We conducted a meta-analysis of tripartite interaction networks examining whether species importance in one dimension of their niche is mirrored in other niche dimensions, and whether this is associated with interaction outcome, intimacy or species richness. We show that keystone species importance is positively associated across multiple ecological niche dimensions, independently of abundance, and find no evidence that multidimensionality of keystone species is influenced by the explanatory variables. We propose that the role of keystone species extends across multiple ecological niche dimensions, with important implications for ecosystem resilience and conservation.

FUNGAL ECOLOGY,Impact of Norway spruce pre-degradation stages induced by Gloeophyllum trabeum on fungal and bacterial communities,"In forest ecosystems, fungi are the key actors in wood decay. They have the capability to degrade lignified substrates and the woody biomass of coniferous forests, with brown rot fungi being common colonizers. Brown rots are typically involved in the earliest phase of lignocellulose breakdown, which therefore influences colo-nization by other microorganisms. However, few studies have focused on the impact of introducing decayed wood into forest environments to gauge successional colonization by natural bacterial and fungal communities following partial decay. This study aimed to address this issue by investigating the bacterial and fungal colo-nization of Norway spruce (Picea abies) wood, after intermediate and advanced laboratory-based, pre-decay, by the brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum. Using Illumina metabarcoding, the in situ colonization of the wood blocks was monitored 70 days after the blocks were placed on the forest floor and covered with litter. We observed significant changes in the bacterial and fungal communities associated with the pre-decayed stage. Further, the wood substrate condition acted as a gatekeeper by reducing richness for both microbial communities and diversity of fungal communities.

The increase in the incidence in hazelnut orchards observed during recent years in Central Italy is increasing the need for information and studies on its biology and ecology, and how environmental factors (e.g., temperature) influence its development. For this purpose, seven isolates from different provenances of M. coryli were studied under controlled laboratory con-ditions with the goal of laying the foundations of a mathematical model describing key aspects of the pathogen's life cycle. The mycelium growth rate was measured at 6 different constant temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 degrees C) and fixed relative humidity (100\% RH), while the germination rate of the conidia was evaluated at 8 different constant temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 23, 25, 27, 30 degrees C). The dataset was subsequently analyzed estimating the parameters of non-linearfunctions which consider the relationship between the mycelium growth rate and the germination of the spores with environmental temperature.

FUNGAL ECOLOGY,Endophytes dominate fungal communities in six-year-old veteranisation wounds in living oak trunks,"Old trees are rare in the landscape, as are many of their associated species. Veteranisation is a method by which attempts are made to create microhabitats, otherwise found only in old trees, in younger trees at an earlier stage than would occur naturally. Here, we analysed the early fungal succession in 6 y-old veteranisation wounds in ca. 100 y old living oak trunks by DNA-barcoding of the wood at eight sites in Sweden and Norway. We hypothesised basidiomycetes would be most abundant, and exposed sapwood and heartwood would select for different communities. We identified 686 fungal taxa, mainly ascomycetes, with a large overlap in species composition and surprisingly similar species richness, i.e. 325 vs. 308-360, between intact and different types of damaged wood, respectively. Endophytes continued to be present and common in damaged wood. The results demonstrate that damage to sapwood and heartwood partly select for different fungi and that 6 y is too early to evaluate if veteranisation can positively favour fungi of conservation interest.(c) 2020 The Authors.

Its fruit bodies tend to form fairy rings with a visible stimulating zone. Our previous studies have investigated the large-scale genetic structure among wild populations of F. luteovirens, but the mechanisms underlying the current genotype distribution pattern remain unknown. The balance between sexual and asexual reproduction affects the establishment and structure of populations. Measuring genet size and density is an effective approach to investigating the reproduction strategies of this species. In the current study, 234 fruit bodies and 79 soil samples were collected from three sampling sites over 3y, revealing that F. luteovirens exhibits relatively large genets. Very few new genets were detected over the 3y, illustrating that this species relies more on vegetative growth and can persist for long periods underground as mycelia. Moreover, the underground genet data showed a close relationship with the above-ground genet data. Our study found limited fine-scale gene flow, contrary to our previous large-scale genetic study of F. luteovirens, the present study found limited fine-scale gene flow of this species.

FUNGAL ECOLOGY,High phenotypic variability in the wood decay fungus Phellopilus nigrolimitatus,"Genetic and phenotypic variation among individuals increases population resilience to external distur-bances and enables quicker adaptation to changing environments. Since the predominant phase in the fungal lifecycle occurs belowground or within substrates, it is difficult to assess the level of variation in functional traits occurring within species in natural environments. In this study, we investigated phenotypic variation in the wood-decay fungus Phellopilus nigrolimitatus and related this to genet size, measured as vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs). Out of 321 wood samples and sporocarps collected on six logs of Picea abies, we isolated 230 dikaryotic isolates that were grouped into 53 VCGs based on culturing experiments. The number of VCGs per log varied from six to twelve, with large variation in sizes; the smallest VCG was derived from a single wood sample, while the largest was isolated across 31 wood samples stretching over 15 m. The size of the VCGs was positively correlated with the area of the spore-producing layer of the sporocarps, implying that larger genets produce more spores. Additionally, the phenotypic variation among isolates of P. nigrolimitatus was high, both in terms of growth morphology and coloration, and consistent with the delimitation of isolates into VCGs. Isolates could to a large extent be correctly assigned to the VCGs a priori based purely on culture phenotype. This study reveals that extensive phenotypic variation can be observed between fungal genets at very fine spatial scale, and calls for more studies looking at intraspecific phenotypic variation, in line with assessing genetic diversity in fungi.

FUNGAL ECOLOGY,"Metabolic activity on Biolog FF MicroPlate suggests organic substrate decomposition by Aspergillus terreus NTOU4989 isolated from Kueishan Island Hydrothermal Vent Field, Taiwan","Aspergillus terreus NTOU4989 was isolated from sulfur sediment collected at Kueishan Island Hydrothermal Vent Field, Taiwan, and was shown to be able to grow at 45 degrees C and pH 3 in seawater, characteristics of hydrothermal vent sites. Fungi are one of the major decomposers in the marine environment, and to find out whether A. terreus NTOU4989 can fulfill such a role at the site, this study investigated its metabolic activity using the Biolog FF MicroPlateTM under different growth conditions (45 degrees C/pH 3, 45 degrees C/pH 7, 25 degrees C/pH 3, 25 degrees C/pH 7) with/without addition of Al3+, Fe2+ and Mn2+, major metal ions in the vent effluent. The greatest metabolic activity was observed at 25 degrees C/pH 3 with/without the metal ions based on substrate richness (RS, metabolic richness), average well colour development (AWCD, metabolic capacity) and average well turbidity development (AWTD, mycelial production). Significant low RS, AWCD and AWTD were observed at 45 degrees C, suggesting that A. terreus NTOU4989 is a thermotolerant fungus. The presence of the metal ions did not have a significant effect on its metabolic activity. Monomers of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, and common sugars and amino acids of algae were utilized in selected conditions, providing evidence of wood and algal decomposition by the fungus at the hydrothermal vent site.",Ascomycota; Enzymes; Extremophile; Laccase; Marine fungi,2022,60,NA,10.1016/j.funeco.2022.101157,1754-5048,22,177,218,1384,5,NA,150,10,No,175,125,yes,no,yes
FUNGAL ECOLOGY,Secondary metabolites and nutrients explain fungal community composition in aspen wood,"Fungi are the main decomposers of litter and wood, driving carbon and nutrient cycles. Despite a large number of studies, fungal community composition is remarkably difficult to predict. In the present study, we explore the importance of secondary metabolites and nutrient content in wood and bark as determinants of fungal com-munity composition. We used aspen (Populus tremula) logs of similar size, from one location, and measured concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and secondary metabolites in bark and wood sampled shortly after felling. Fungal DNA was extracted from logs directly after felling and after two seasons of decomposition, and the fungal communities were assessed using DNA-metabarcoding. Concentrations of metabolites varied considerably be-tween individual trees, and we also observed significant differences within single trees. Plant metabolites and nitrogen concentrations significantly affected fungal community composition. For the overall fungal commu-nities and for wood saprotrophic fungi, the explanatory power of wood and bark metabolites was highest in logs decomposed over two seasons. In recently felled trees however, concentration of metabolites had a stronger effect on plant pathogens and endophytes. We conclude that secondary metabolites represent an overlooked, but important niche dimension for fungal communities in both functional sapwood and dead wood.",Secondary metabolites; Phenolics; Wood saprotroph; Endophyte; Pathogen; Community composition,2022,59,SI,10.1016/j.funeco.2021.101115,1754-5048,11,86,196,1396,6,NA,150,10,No,175,125,yes,no,yes
FUNGAL ECOLOGY,"Strict substrate requirements alongside rapid substrate turnover may indicate an early colonization: A case study of Pleurotus calyptratus (Agaricales, Basidiomycota)","Pleurotus calyptratus is a wood-inhabiting oyster mushroom associated with Populus tremula and P. alba. This fungus is rather common in Ukraine, but considered rare in many other European countries. Aiming to find causes for variation in rarity, we conducted habitat mapping and repeated surveys to understand the substrate requirements and fruiting dynamics of P. calyptratus. We showed that fruiting is strictly associated with older trees and early decay stages, and not with physical properties of a tree trunk like volume or position. This timespan of substrate suitability lasts for 1-3 y, determining rapid substrate turnover. We also detected DNA of P. calyptratus in living tissues of visually healthy trees, meaning its latent presence in the hosts, which places the fungus in a position to be a pioneer in a fungal succession. Despite the high spatial and temporal variation in fruiting, five annual surveys demonstrated no significant trends in P. calyptratus population's dynamics, and supported the assumption of random variation in fruiting, driven mostly by dynamics of forest stands. Therefore, we hypothesize that P. calyptratus' relative abundance in Ukraine is explained by continuous substrate supply from large homogenous aspen stands that are rare in the rest of Europe due to intensive management.",Wood -inhabiting fungi; Deadwood; Aspen; Occupancy; Oyster mushrooms; Conservation; Monitoring; Ukraine,2022,59,SI,10.1016/j.funeco.2021.101098,1754-5048,20,166,201,1321,8,NA,150,10,No,175,125,yes,no,yes

We sampled dead wood from these large-diameter logs after 2 to 6 y of decomposition and determined wood rot type as a continuous variable using the lignin loss/density loss ratio (L/D) and assessed wood-rotting fungal guilds using high-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS) of the ITS-2 marker. We found L/ D values in line with a white rot dominance in all three tree species, with pine having lower L/D values than aspen and birch. Based on HTAS data, white rot fungi were the most abundant and diverse wood-rotting fungal guild, and soft rot fungi were more abundant and diverse than brown rot fungi in logs with low L/D values. For aspen and birch logs, decay type was related to the wood density at sampling. For the pine logs, decay type was associated with the balance between white and brown/soft rot fungi abundance and OTU richness. Our results demonstrate that decay type is governed by biotic and abiotic factors, which vary by tree species.",Wood rot fungi; Decay type; Soft rot; White rot; FACE; HTAS; Metabarcoding; Brown rot,2022,59,SI,10.1016/j.funeco.2022.101151,1754-5048,13,92,191,1187,8,NA,150,10,No,175,125,yes,no,yes
GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Alternative Modes of Introgression-Mediated Selection Shaped Crop Adaptation to Novel Climates,"Recent plant genomic studies provide fine-grained details on the evolutionary consequences of adaptive introgression during crop domestication. Modern genomic approaches and analytical methods now make it possible to better separate the introgression signal from the demographic signal thus providing a more comprehensive and complex picture of the role of introgression in local adaptation. Adaptive introgression has been fundamental for crop expansion and has involved complex patterns of gene flow. In addition to providing new and more favorable alleles of large effect, introgression during the early stages of domestication also increased allelic diversity at adaptive loci. Previous studies have largely underestimated the effect of such increased diversity following introgression. Recent genomic studies in wheat, potato, maize, grapevine, and ryegrass show that introgression of multiple genes, of as yet unknown effect, increased the effectiveness of purifying selection, and promoted disruptive or fluctuating selection in early cultivars and landraces. Historical selection processes associated with introgression from crop wild relatives provide an instructive analog for adaptation to current climate change and offer new avenues for crop breeding research that are expected to be instrumental for strengthening food security in the coming years.",crop wild relatives; purifying selection; fluctuating selection; hybridization; polygenic adaptation; climate change,2022,14,8,10.1093/gbe/evac107,1759-6653,11,94,188,1362,6,20,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Chromosome-level Genome Assembly of the High-altitude Leopard (Panthera pardus) Sheds Light on Its Environmental Adaptation,"The leopard (Panthera pardus) has the largest natural distribution from low- to high-altitude areas of any wild felid species, but recent studies have revealed that leopards have disappeared from large areas, probably owing to poaching, a decline of prey species, and habitat degradation. Here, we reported the chromosome-scale genome assembly of the high-altitude leopard (HL) based on nanopore sequencing and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) technology. Panthera genomes revealed similar repeat composition, and there was an appreciably conserved synteny between HL and the other two Panthera genomes. Divergence time analysis based on the whole genomes revealed that the HL and the low-altitude leopard differentiate from a common ancestor similar to 2.2 Ma. Through comparative genomics analyses, we found molecular genetic signatures that may reflect high-altitude adaptation of the HL. Three HL-specific missense mutations were detected in two positively selected genes, that is, ITGA7 (Ala112Gly, Asp113Val, and Gln115Pro) and NOTCH2 (Ala2398Ser), which are likely to be associated with hypoxia adaptation.

GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Comparative Genome and Evolution Analyses of an Endangered Stony Coral Species Dendrophyllia cribrosa Near Dokdo Islands in the East Sea,"Stony corals often harbor intracellular photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae that receive dissolved inorganic nutrients. However, Dendrophyllia cribrosa is a nonsymbiotic stony coral distributed in the western Pacific. We assembled a chromosome-level D. cribrosa genome using PacBio and Hi-C technologies. The final assembly was 625 Mb, distributed on 14 chromosomes, and contained 30,493 protein-coding genes. The Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs analysis revealed a percentage of 96.8 of the metazoan genome. A comparative phylogenetic analysis revealed that D. cribrosa, which lacks symbionts, evolved to acquire cellular energy by expanding genes related to acyl-CoA metabolism and carbohydrate transporters. This species also has expanded immune-related genes involved in the receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway. In addition, we observed a specific expansion of calcification genes, such as coral acid-rich proteins and carbonic anhydrase, in D. cribrosa.

GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Dynamic Interactions Between Mega Symbiosis ICEs and Bacterial Chromosomes Maintain Genome Architecture,"Acquisition of mobile genetic elements can confer novel traits to bacteria. Some integrative and conjugative elements confer upon members of Bradyrhizobium the capacity to fix nitrogen in symbiosis with legumes. These so-called symbiosis integrative conjugative elements (symICEs) can be extremely large and vary as monopartite and polypartite configurations within chromosomes of related strains. These features are predicted to impose fitness costs and have defied explanation. Here, we show that chromosome architecture is largely conserved despite diversity in genome composition, variations in locations of attachment sites recognized by integrases of symICEs, and differences in large-scale chromosomal changes that occur upon integration. Conversely, many simulated nonnative chromosome-symICE combinations are predicted to result in lethal deletions or disruptions to architecture. Findings suggest that there is compatibility between chromosomes and symICEs. We hypothesize that the size and structural flexibility of symICEs are important for generating combinations that maintain chromosome architecture across a genus of nitrogen-fixing bacteria with diverse and dynamic genomes.",evolution; horizontal gene transfer; symbiotic nitrogen fixation; mobile genetic elements; integrative and conjugative elements,2022,14,6,10.1093/gbe/evac078,1759-6653,12,103,157,1191,5,20,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Evolution of the Short Form of DNMT3A, DNMT3A2, Occurred in the Common Ancestor of Mammals","Genomic imprinting is found in marsupial and eutherian mammals, but not in monotremes. While the primary regulator of genomic imprinting in eutherians is differential DNA methylation between parental alleles, conserved imprinted genes in marsupials tend to lack DNA methylation at their promoters. DNA methylation at eutherian imprinted genes is mainly catalyzed by a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzyme, DNMT3A. There are two isoforms of eutherian DNMT3A: DNMT3A and DNMT3A2. DNMT3A2 is the primary isoform for establishing DNA methylation at eutherian imprinted genes and is essential for eutherian genomic imprinting. In this study, we investigated whether DNMT3A2 is also present in the two other mammalian lineages, marsupials and monotremes. We identified DNMT3A2 in both marsupials and monotremes, although imprinting has not been identified in monotremes. By analyzing genomic sequences and transcriptome data across vertebrates, we concluded that the evolution of DNMT3A2 occurred in the common ancestor of mammals. In addition, DNMT3A/3A2 gene and protein expression during gametogenesis showed distinct sexual dimorphisms in a marsupial, the tammar wallaby, and this pattern coincided with the sex-specific DNA methylation reprogramming in this species as it does in mice. Our results show that DNMT3A2 is present in all mammalian groups and suggests that the basic DNMT3A/3A2-based DNA methylation mechanism is conserved at least in therian mammals.",marsupials; eutherians; monotremes; DNA methylation; genomic imprinting,2022,14,7,10.1093/gbe/evac094,1759-6653,15,90,210,1461,5,20,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Adult male birds advance spring migratory phenology faster than females and juveniles across North America,"Advances in spring migratory phenology comprise some of the most well-documented evidence for the impacts of climate change on birds. Nevertheless, surprisingly little research has investigated whether birds are shifting their migratory phenology equally across sex and age classes-a question critical to understanding the potential for trophic mismatch. We used 60 years of bird banding data across North America-comprising over 4 million captures in total-to investigate both spring and fall migratory phenology for a total of 98 bird species across sex and age classes, with the exact numbers of species for each analysis depending on season-specific data availability. Consistent with protandry, in spring (n = 89 species), adult males were the first to arrive and immature females were the last to arrive. In fall (n = 98), there was little difference between sexes, but adults tended to depart earlier than juveniles. Over 60 years, adult males advanced their phenology the fastest (-0.84 days per decade, 95 CrI = -1.22 to -0.47, n = 36), while adult and immature females advanced at a slower pace, causing the gap in male and female arrival times to widen over time. In the fall, there was no overall trend in phenology by age or sex (n = 57), driven in part by high interspecific variation related to breeding and molt strategies. Our results indicate consistent and predictable age- and sex-based differences in the rates at which species' springtime phenology is shifting. The growing gap between male and female migratory arrival indicates sex-based plasticity in adaptation to climate change that has strong potential to negatively impact current and future population trends.",age; arrival date; breeding latitude; climate change; fall migration; molt strategy; protandry; sex,2023,29,2,10.1111/gcb.16492,1354-1013,15,106,266,1689,8,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Browning affects pelagic productivity in northern lakes by surface water warming and carbon fertilization,"Global change impacts important environmental drivers for pelagic gross primary production (GPP) in northern lakes, such as temperature, light, nutrient, and inorganic carbon availability. Separate and/or synergistic impacts of these environmental drivers on pelagic GPP remain largely unresolved. Here, we assess key drivers of pelagic GPP by combining detailed depth profiles of summer pelagic GPP with environmental and climatic data across 45 small and shallow lakes across northern Sweden (20 boreal, 6 subarctic, and 19 arctic lakes). We found that across lakes summer pelagic GPP was strongest associated with lake water temperatures, lake carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations impacted by lake water pH, and further moderated by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations influencing light and nutrient conditions. We further used this dataset to assess the extent of additional DOC-induced warming of epilimnia (here named internal warming), which was especially pronounced in shallow lakes (decreasing 0.96 degrees C for every decreasing m in average lake depth) and increased with higher concentrations of DOC. Additionally, the total pools and relative proportion of dissolved inorganic carbon and DOC, further influenced pelagic GPP with drivers differing slightly among the boreal, subarctic and Arctic biomes. Our study provides novel insights in that global change affects pelagic GPP in northern lakes not only by modifying the organic carbon cycle and light and nutrient conditions, but also through modifications of inorganic carbon supply and temperature. Considering the large-scale impacts and similarities of global warming, browning and recovery from acidification of lakes at higher latitudes throughout the northern hemisphere, these changes are likely to operate on a global scale.",acidification; bicarbonate system; DOC; inorganic carbon; primary production; stoichiometry; supersaturation; temperature,2023,29,2,10.1111/gcb.16469,1354-1013,14,105,260,1809,8,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Environmental DNA reveals a mismatch between diversity facets of Amazonian fishes in response to contrasting geographical, environmental and anthropogenic effects","Freshwater ecosystems are among the most endangered ecosystem in the world. Understanding how human activities affect these ecosystems requires disentangling and quantifying the contribution of the factors driving community assembly. While it has been largely studied in temperate freshwaters, tropical ecosystems remain challenging to study due to the high species richness and the lack of knowledge on species distribution. Here, the use of eDNA-based fish inventories combined to a community-level modelling approach allowed depicting of assembly rules and quantifying the relative contribution of geographic, environmental and anthropic factors to fish assembly. We then used the model predictions to map spatial biodiversity and assess the representativity of sites surveyed in French Guiana within the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) and highlighted areas that should host unique freshwater fish assemblages. We demonstrated a mismatch between the taxonomic and functional diversity. Taxonomic assemblages between but also within basins were mainly the results of dispersal limitation resulting from basin isolation and natural river barriers. Contrastingly, functional assemblages were ruled by environmental and anthropic factors. The regional mapping of fish diversity indicated that the sites surveyed within the EU WFD had a better representativity of the regional functional diversity than taxonomic diversity. Importantly, we also showed that the assemblages expected to be the most altered by anthropic factors were the most poorly represented in terms of functional diversity in the surveyed sites. The predictions of unique functional and taxonomic assemblages could, therefore, guide the establishment of new survey sites to increase fish diversity representativity and improve this monitoring program.",beta-diversity; community modelling; deforestation; environmental DNA; freshwater fish; functional diversity; taxonomic diversity,2023,29,7,10.1111/gcb.16533,1354-1013,20,162,254,1822,7,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Experimental temperatures shape host microbiome diversity and composition,"Global climate change has led to more extreme thermal events. Plants and animals harbour diverse microbial communities, which may be vital for their physiological performance and help them survive stressful climatic conditions. The extent to which microbiome communities change in response to warming or cooling may be important for predicting host performance under global change. Using a meta-analysis of 1377 microbiomes from 43 terrestrial and aquatic species, we found a decrease in the amplicon sequence variant-level microbiome phylogenetic diversity and alteration of microbiome composition under both experimental warming and cooling. Microbiome beta dispersion was not affected by temperature changes. We showed that the host habitat and experimental factors affected microbiome diversity and composition more than host biological traits. In particular, aquatic organisms-especially in marine habitats-experienced a greater depletion in microbiome diversity under cold conditions, compared to terrestrial hosts. Exposure involving a sudden long and static temperature shift was associated with microbiome diversity loss, but this reduction was attenuated by prior-experimental lab acclimation or when a ramped regime (i.e., warming) was used. Microbial differential abundance and co-occurrence network analyses revealed several potential indicator bacterial classes for hosts in heated environments and on different biome levels. Overall, our findings improve our understanding on the impact of global temperature changes on animal and plant microbiome structures across a diverse range of habitats. The next step is to link these changes to measures of host fitness, as well as microbial community functions, to determine whether microbiomes can buffer some species against a more thermally variable and extreme world.",global climate change; host microbiome; meta-analysis; microbiome disturbance; species persistence; temperature; thermal tolerance,2023,29,1,10.1111/gcb.16429,1354-1013,8,73,254,1829,7,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Interactive effects of global change drivers as determinants of the link between soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning,"Biodiversity, both aboveground and belowground, is negatively affected by global changes such as drought or warming. This loss of biodiversity impacts Earth's ecosystems, as there is a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF). Even though soils host a large fraction of biodiversity that underlies major ecosystem functions, studies exploring the relationship between soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (sBEF) as influenced by global change drivers (GCDs) remain scarce. Here we highlight the need to decipher sBEF relationships under the effect of interactive GCDs that are intimately connected in a changing world. We first state that sBEF relationships depend on the type of function (e.g., C cycling or decomposition) and biodiversity facet (e.g., abundance, species richness, or biomass) considered. Then, we shed light on the impact of single and interactive GCDs on soil biodiversity and sBEF and show that results from scarce studies studying interactive effects range from antagonistic to additive to synergistic when two individual GCDs cooccur. This indicates the need for studies quantitatively accounting for the impacts of interactive GCDs on sBEF relationships. Finally, we provide guidelines for optimized methodological and experimental approaches to study sBEF in a changing world that will provide more valuable information on the real impact of (interactive) GCDs on sBEF. Together, we highlight the need to decipher the sBEF relationship in soils to better understand soil functioning under ongoing global changes, as changes in sBEF are of immediate importance for ecosystem functioning.",biodiversity ecosystem functioning; biodiversity facets; global change drivers; interactive effects; soil biodiversity; soil biodiversity ecosystem functioning,2023,29,2,10.1111/gcb.16471,1354-1013,17,124,239,1652,6,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Land use changes biomass and temporal patterns of insect cross-ecosystem flows,"Emergent aquatic insects constitute an important food source for higher trophic levels, linking aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems. Little is known about how land use affects the biomass or composition of insect emergence. Previous studies are limited to individual time points or seasons, hampering understanding of annual biomass export patterns and detection of phenological changes. Over 1 year's primary emergence period, we continuously determined the biomass, abundance, and identity of >45,000 aquatic insects and recorded land-use-related environmental variables in 20 stream sites using a paired design with upstream forested sites and downstream agricultural sites. Total insect biomass and abundance were 2-7 mg day(-1) m(-2) and 7-36 ind day(-1) m(-2) higher in agricultural than forested sites. However, we found turnover of families between forested and agricultural sites, with more insects with shorter generation time in agriculture, indicating lower sensitivity to land-use-related stress because of higher recovery potential. Except for stoneflies, biomass and abundance of major orders were higher in agriculture, but their phenology differed. For different orders, emergence peaked 30 days earlier to 51 days later in agriculture than forest, whereas total abundance and biomass both peaked earlier in agriculture: 3-5 and 3-19 days, respectively. The most important land-use-related drivers were pesticide toxicity and electrical conductivity, which were differentially associated with different aquatic insect order abundances and biomass. Overall, we found that land use was related to changes in composition and phenology of aquatic insect emergence, which is likely to affect food-web dynamics in a cross-ecosystem context.",abundance; aquatic insects; biomass; land use; phenology; turnover,2023,29,1,10.1111/gcb.16462,1354-1013,11,78,245,1749,6,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Limited recovery following a massive seagrass decline in subarctic eastern Canada,"Over the last few decades, there has been an increasing recognition for seagrasses' contribution to the functioning of nearshore ecosystems and climate change mitigation. Nevertheless, seagrass ecosystems have been deteriorating globally at an accelerating rate during recent decades. In 2017, research into the condition of eelgrass (Zostera marina) along the eastern coast of James Bay, Canada, was initiated in response to reports of eelgrass decline by the Cree First Nations of Eeyou Istchee. As part of this research, we compiled and analyzed two decades of eelgrass cover data and three decades of eelgrass monitoring data (biomass and density) to detect changes and assess possible environmental drivers. We detected a major decline in eelgrass condition between 1995 and 1999, which encompassed the entire east coast of James Bay. Surveys conducted in 2019 and 2020 indicated limited changes post-decline, for example, low eelgrass cover (<25\%), low aboveground biomass, smaller shoots than before 1995, and marginally low densities persisted at most sites. Overall, the synthesized datasets show a 40\% loss of eelgrass meadows with >50\% cover in eastern James Bay since 1995, representing the largest scale eelgrass decline documented in eastern Canada since the massive die-off event that occurred in the 1930s along the North Atlantic coast. Using biomass data collected since 1982, but geographically limited to the sector of the coast near the regulated La Grande River, generalized additive modeling revealed eelgrass meadows are affected by local sea surface temperature, early ice breakup, and higher summer freshwater discharge.

GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,Plant secondary metabolic responses to global climate change: A meta-analysis in medicinal and aromatic plants,"Plant secondary metabolites (SMs) play crucial roles in plant-environment interactions and contribute greatly to human health. Global climate changes are expected to dramatically affect plant secondary metabolism, yet a systematic understanding of such influences is still lacking. Here, we employed medicinal and aromatic plants (MAAPs) as model plant taxa and performed a meta-analysis from 360 publications using 1828 paired observations to assess the responses of different SMs levels and the accompanying plant traits to elevated carbon dioxide (eCO(2)), elevated temperature (eT), elevated nitrogen deposition (eN) and decreased precipitation (dP). The overall results showed that phenolic and terpenoid levels generally respond positively to eCO(2) but negatively to eN, while the total alkaloid concentration was increased remarkably by eN. By contrast, dP promotes the levels of all SMs, while eT exclusively exerts a positive influence on the levels of phenolic compounds. Further analysis highlighted the dependence of SM responses on different moderators such as plant functional types, climate change levels or exposure durations, mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. Moreover, plant phenolic and terpenoid responses to climate changes could be attributed to the variations of C/N ratio and total soluble sugar levels, while the trade-off supposition contributed to SM responses to climate changes other than eCO(2). Taken together, our results predicted the distinctive SM responses to diverse climate changes in MAAPs and allowed us to define potential moderators responsible for these variations. Further, linking SM responses to C-N metabolism and growth-defence balance provided biological understandings in terms of plant secondary metabolic regulation.",biomass; C; N; global climate changes; medicinal and aromatic plants; moderators; secondary metabolites; total soluble sugar; trade-off,2023,29,2,10.1111/gcb.16484,1354-1013,15,110,251,1790,9,NA,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Here, we examined the critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and maximum environmental water temperature (T-max) of larvae from 29 anuran species across a latitudinal gradient (22-43 degrees N) to test how latitude and habitat type (open or closed-forest ponds) affected warming tolerance, an index of vulnerability to climate change. Location Taiwan, Korea, Japan. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Anurans. Results We showed that topen ponds lowered warming tolerance, regardless of latitude and phylogenetic clustering, contrasting the established literature that warming tolerance is lower at tropical latitudes, which only applied to species in forest ponds in this study. Importantly, biophysical models at the local scale suggest that increasing deforestation will exacerbate the effects of climate warming on warming tolerance. Main conclusions Local effects of accelerated warming and habitat modification mean that species with range-restricted life stages will become more vulnerable to anthropogenic change.",amphibian decline; critical thermal maximum; latitudinal variation; macrophysiology; microhabitat; thermal tolerance; warming tolerance,2023,32,1,10.1111/geb.13602,1466-822X,12,93,169,1228,7,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,Plants dispersed by a non-frugivorous migrant change throughout the annual cycle,"Aim Migratory waterfowl are important endozoochory vectors for a range of plants lacking fleshy fruits. Our aim was to study the critical question of how endozoochory rates change throughout the annual cycle, and how this relates to plant life-form and phenology. Location Lake Velence, Hungary. Time period 2017-2018. Major taxa studied Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Angiospermae, Charophyta. Methods We studied waterfowl endozoochory, quantifying seeds and other diaspores dispersed by mallards by collecting faecal samples monthly (n(total) = 670) at a Hungarian lake. We tested the germinability of all seeds recovered from the faecal samples. Main conclusions We extracted 5,760 seeds representing 35 plant taxa from mallard faecal samples, and 40\% of these seeds germinated successfully following gut passage. We found major differences between seasons in the species composition of the seeds recovered. The peak in species diversity and in abundance of terrestrial seeds coincided with the spring migration of mallards. Importantly, endozoochory was only strongly synchronized with seed production in submerged, but not in emergent or terrestrial plants, illustrating the potential for endozoochory of seeds ingested from the soil seed bank. Overall, our results suggest that endozoochory by migratory waterfowl is a strong and underestimated driver of plant distributions, and is likely to facilitate plant range shifts under climate change, and after introduction of alien species.",dispersal; phenology; seasonality; seed bank; waterfowl; wetland,2023,32,1,10.1111/geb.13608,1466-822X,11,80,215,1491,6,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Rarity, geography, and plant exposure to global change in the California Floristic Province","AimRarity and geographic aspects of species distributions mediate their vulnerability to global change. We explore the relationships between species rarity and geography and their exposure to climate and land use change in a biodiversity hotspot. LocationCalifornia, USA. TaxaOne hundred and six terrestrial plants. MethodsWe estimated four rarity traits: range size, niche breadth, number of habitat patches, and patch isolation; and three geographic traits: mean elevation, topographic heterogeneity, and distance to coast. We used species distribution models to measure species exposure-predicted change in continuous habitat suitability within currently occupied habitat-under climate and land use change scenarios. Using regression models, decision-tree models and variance partitioning, we assessed the relationships between species rarity, geography, and exposure to climate and land use change. ResultsRarity, geography and greenhouse gas emissions scenario explained >35\% of variance in climate change exposure and >61\% for land use change exposure. While rarity traits (range size and number of habitat patches) were most important for explaining species exposure to climate change, geographic traits (elevation and topographic heterogeneity) were more strongly associated with species' exposure to land use change. Main conclusionsSpecies with restricted range sizes and low topographic heterogeneity across their distributions were predicted to be the most exposed to climate change, while species at low elevations were the most exposed to habitat loss via land use change. However, even some broadly distributed species were projected to lose >70\% of their currently suitable habitat due to climate and land use change if they are in geographically vulnerable areas, emphasizing the need to consider both species rarity traits and geography in vulnerability assessments.",NA,2023,32,2,10.1111/geb.13618,1466-822X,13,91,261,1887,NA,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,A global analysis of viviparity in squamates highlights its prevalence in cold climates,"Aim Viviparity has evolved more times in squamates than in any other vertebrate group; therefore, squamates offer an excellent model system in which to study the patterns, drivers and implications of reproductive mode evolution. Based on current species distributions, we examined three selective forces hypothesized to drive the evolution of squamate viviparity (cold climate, variable climate and hypoxic conditions) and tested whether viviparity is associated with larger body size. Location Global. Time period Present day. Taxon Squamata. Methods We compiled a dataset of 9061 squamate species, including their distributions, elevation, climate, body mass and reproductive modes. We applied species-level and assemblage-level approaches for predicting reproductive mode, both globally and within biogeographical realms. We tested the relationships of temperature, interannual and intra-annual climatic variation, elevation (as a proxy for hypoxic conditions) and body mass with reproductive mode, using path analyses to account for correlations among the environmental predictors. Results Viviparity was strongly associated with cold climates at both species and assemblage levels, despite the prevalence of viviparity in some warm climates. Viviparity was not clearly correlated with climatic variability or elevation. The probability of being viviparous exhibited a weak positive correlation with body size. Conclusions Although phylogenetic history is important, potentially explaining the occurrence of viviparous species in regions that are warm at present, current global squamate distribution is characterized by a higher relative abundance of viviparity in cold environments, supporting the prediction of the ``cold-climate{''} hypothesis. The roles of climatic variation and hypoxia are less important and not straightforward. Elevation probably exerts various selective pressures and influences the prevalence of viviparity primarily through its effect on temperature rather than on oxygen concentration.",biogeography; body size; climatic variability; cold climate; elevation; global analysis; reproduction; squamates; structural equation modelling; viviparity,2022,31,12,10.1111/geb.13598,1466-822X,13,87,272,2019,10,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,Mammalian body size evolution was shaped by habitat transitions as an indirect effect of climate change,"Aim: Body size evolution has long been hypothesized to have been driven by factors linked to climate change, but the specific mechanisms are difficult to disentangle due to the wide range of functional traits that covary with body size. In this study, we investigated the impact of regional habitat changes as a potential indirect effect of climate change on body size evolution. Location: Europe and North America. Time period: The Neogene (similar to 23-2 million years ago). Major taxa: Five orders of terrestrial mammals: Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Perissodactyla, Proboscidea and Primates. Methods: We compared the two continental faunas, which have exceptional fossil records of terrestrial mammals and underwent different processes of habitat transition during the Neogene. Using Bayesian multilevel regression models, we assessed the variation in the temporal dynamics of body size diversity among ecographic groups, defined by their continent of occurrence and dietary preference. Results: Model comparisons unanimously supported a combined effect of diet and continent on all metrics of body size frequency distributions, rejecting the shared energetic advantage of larger bodies in colder climates as a dominant mechanism of body size evolution. Rather, the diet-specific dynamics on each continent pinpointed an indirect effect of climate change - change in habitat availability, and thus the resource landscape as a key driver of mammalian evolution. Main conclusions: Our study highlights dietary preference as a mechanistic link between mammalian evolution and habitat transition mediating an indirect climate-change effect and demonstrates the complexity of climatic influence on biodiversity. Our findings suggest that the intensified habitat modification today likely poses a bigger threat than climate change in itself to living mammals, and perhaps all endotherms.",fossil diversity; habitat change; macroevolution; palaeobiome; regional fauna; trophic niche,2022,31,12,10.1111/geb.13594,1466-822X,16,103,271,1882,6,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Combination of organic farming and flower strips in agricultural landscapes - A feasible method to maximise functional diversity of plant traits related to pollination,"Agri-environment schemes (AES) are valuable instruments to support pollination in agricultural landscapes. Evaluating AES based on their effects on pollinators has high practical relevance for agricultural production and nature conservation. In our two-year assessment, we studied the effectiveness of two AES (organic farming vs flower strips) on plant traits associated with pollinator attraction (flower size, colour, and ultraviolet pattern) and reward accessibility (flowering duration, and nectar quantity). We selected ten landscapes along a landscape-scale field size gradient in Central Germany. Three types of winter wheat fields (organic, and conventional fields with and without flower strips) were chosen in each landscape. We sampled the vegetation in transects designated in characteristic field parts, i.e. grassy margins, field edges (or flower strips), and field interiors in the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017. We calculated community-weighted means and functional diversity of plant traits and tested the effects of field size, management, and within-field position with linear mixed-effects models. We showed that organic fields and flower strips provided more abundant and functionally more diverse flowers than conventional fields. Flower strips were superior with the highest insect-pollinated plant cover and the highest ratio of plants with flowers showing ultraviolet patterns. Although grassy margins next to flower strips harboured twice as many species as those without flower strips, this positive effect did not emerge in conventional field interiors. Landscape configuration expressed as mean field size did not affect pollination traits in our study. Our results highlighted that both organic farming and flower strips maintained abundant and functionally diverse insect-pollinated flora, and thus they can potentially support larger pollinator communities. However, only organic farming could maintain high functional diversity of pollination-related plant traits in field interiors.

GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Effects of a decade of grazing exclusion on three Wyoming big sagebrush community types,"Livestock grazing is the most extensive land use in Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis {[}Beetle \& A. Young] S.L. Welsh) steppe and its effects on plant community characteristics have been greatly debated. However, most of the studies used to support grazing removal evaluated the impacts of excluding historic grazing, rather than the impacts of excluding moderate contemporary grazing (40-50\% utilization, altering season of use) which has vastly different effects on plant communities. Thus, to understand the effects of removing contemporary grazing, we compared contemporary grazed areas to long-term (+10 yrs.) grazing exclusion areas in three common Wyoming big sagebrush community types: intact, degraded, and exotic annual grass-dominated types. Plant community characteristics (cover, density, diversity, richness, dissimilarity) were measured in 2020 and 2021 in five grazed and grazing excluded areas within each community type. Most plant community characteristics were not influenced by grazing exclusion, suggesting that the removal of contemporary grazing has little effect on Wyoming big sagebrush plant communities. The effect of grazing exclusion on Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl) abundance and litter cover varied among community types, suggesting that grazing exclusion effects slightly varied among community types. In contrast, most plant community characteristics varied among community types and between years, suggesting that grazing management plans need to account for the spatial and temporal variability among Wyoming big sagebrush communities. Furthermore, our results suggest that contemporary grazing exclusion has negligible effects compared to contemporary grazing on plant communities, and that exclu-sion of contemporary grazing (passive restoration) does not promote the recovery of degraded and annual grass invaded plant communities.",Exotic annual grass; Defoliation; Grazing management; Passive restoration; Plant community recovery; Sagebrush steppe,2022,40,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02338,NA,14,87,262,1913,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Ecological niche modeling of interactions in a buzz-pollinated invasive weed,"Plant species that are alien and invasive represent an important threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function. These plants compete with native flora for resources and pollinator services. Although most invasive plant species do not depend on pollinators for reproduction and can reproduce uniparentally, some depend on pollinator-assisted reproduction and therefore rely on recruitment of pollinators in the new habitat. Here, we studied Solanum rostratum, a high-risk invasive weed widely distributed around the world that depends on buzz-pollination. It has a floral morphology that depends on medium and large-sized buzzing bees for pollination. The main aim of this study is to model the distribution of an invasive plant, Solanum rostratum, using ecological niches based on its buzz-pollinator distribution. Thus, we hypothesized that S. rostratum is more likely to establish successfully in geographic regions where the appropriate buzz pollinators are also found. We considered the realized and potential distribution of S. rostratum and its pollinators based on occurrence data and ecological niche models combining both abiotic (climatic conditions) and biotic (potential pollinator distribution) factors using the MaxEnt algorithm. Five climatic variables related to temperature and precipitation were impor-tant in determining the realized distribution of S. rostratum, while seasonal temperature was the most important variable in determining pollinator distribution. The distributions of the bum-blebees (Bombus fraternus, B. griseocollis, and B. impatiens) were closely related to the realized distribution of S. rostratum. However, the potential distribution of S. rostratum is wider than that of the pollinator included here, suggesting that other factors such as modifications in the reproductive system or recruitment of other buzzing and non-buzzing bees might be occurring in some invasive populations. We also found that S. rostratum has the potential to expand to un-occupied regions in South America, South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. In conclusion, modeling of niches used by invasive species considering both climatic variables and biological interactions such as pollination would be very useful to study and predict the distri-bution of invasive plants which depend on pollinators to reproduce and establish in new habitats.",Alien invasive plants; Niche model; Pollinators; Potential distribution; Solanum rostratum,2022,39,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02279,NA,10,76,338,2370,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes

Gaoligong, western Yunnan, China","Human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) are major conservation concerns that threaten both wildlife and rural livelihoods, and can vary spatially and temporally in diverse environments. A better un-derstanding of HWC enhances mitigation strategies and promotes human-wildlife coexistence. We gathered HWC incidents from 2012 to 2021 in Longyang District, Yunnan Province, China, to assess their spatial-temporal patterns and determinants. We found that HWC were distributed unevenly, with more occurring near the protected area and away from densely populated areas. Poisson regression indicated that forests and croplands were the key factors influencing the spatial patterns of HWC for Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), but shrubs for rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). Furthermore, the HWC occurrences fluctuated across time, peaking in August -October. These conflicts intensified between 2012 and 2021, mainly involving wild boars (Sus scrofa) and rhesus monkeys, while HWC involving Asiatic black bears declined slightly. We suggest a multi-faceted strategy with compensation, prevention, and conservation awareness to mitigate HWC in this region.",Environment factors; Hotspots; Time series; Carnivores; Human-wildlife interactions,2022,40,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02329,NA,19,151,158,1146,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Freshwater crabs of the Near East: Increased extinction risk from climate change and underrepresented within protected areas,"Climate change is known as an important threat to biodiversity, particularly for freshwater or-ganisms as they have limited dispersal ability. Freshwater crabs are ecologically important freshwater macro-invertebrates and play a key role in their ecosystem. In this study we used an ensemble approach using three machine learning methods (Generalised Boosted Models, Maximum Entropy modeling, Random Forest) and assessed the impacts of climate change on the distribution of eight freshwater crabs (Potamon elbursi, P. fluviatile, P. hippocratis, P. ibericum, P. pelops, P. persicum, P. potamios, P. strouhali) and estimated the protected area coverage for their suitable habitats under current and future climate predictions. We found that the suitable habitats of six species will decrease (P. elbursi, P. fluviatile, P. hippocratis, P. pelops, P. potamios and P. strouhali) while the other two species (P. ibericum and P. persicum) will gain new suitable habitats due to climate change. Loss of suitable habitat would be substantial for the P. hippocratis and P. elbursi as these species will lose 92 \%-100 \% and 75 \%-100 \% of their suitable habitats by 2070, respectively. Additionally, P. fluviatile and P. pelops will lose 70 \%-95 \% and 81 \%-86 \% of their current suitable habitat, respectively. Thus, they are particularly sensitive to climate change. We showed that a very small proportion (< 1 \%) of each species' current suitable habitat is covered by protected areas ranging from zero in P. elbursi, P. persicum and P. strouhali to 0.96 \% in P. fluviatile. Under both climate change models P. elbursi, P. hippocratis and P. potamios will not have protected habitat in the future. Suitable habitats identified to remain stable under climate change will play a critical role in conservation of these freshwater species and will act as climate change refugia.",Climate change; Freshwater species; Conservation; Protected areas,2022,38,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02266,NA,17,124,292,1876,4,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Beyond topo-climatic predictors: Does habitats distribution and remote sensing information improve predictions of species distribution models?,"Species Distribution Models (SDM) represent a powerful tool to predict species' habitat suitability on a landscape and fill the gap between truncated observation data and all possible locations. SDMs have been widely used in theoretical studies of species niches as well as in conservation applications. Here, we evaluated the impacts of predictors' type on models' performances and spatial predictions using 72 plant species belonging to six ecological groups at a regional scale in the area of Geneva (Switzerland). Twelve models were created using various combinations of high-resolution (25 m) explanatory variables including topography, pedology, climate, habitats and remote sensing data. Models integrating a combination of habitats and topopedo-climatic predictors had significantly higher performances, while remote sensing predictors showed low performances. Our results suggest that the number and the level of details of habitat predictors (broad or very precise) do not fundamentally affect prediction maps. However, selecting too few, overly simplified or exceedingly complex habitat predictors tend to lower models' performances. The use of eight habitat categories complemented with eight topopedo-climatic predictors produced models with the highest performances. Ecological groups of species responded differently to models and while alpine and ruderal species have greater average performances due to a high affinity with topopedo-climatic predictors, wetlands' species were less performant on average. These results underline the necessity of developing or having access to habitats distribution data especially in a conservation context.",Plant distribution; Explanatory variables; Model performances; Land -use -land -cover; MaxEnt,2022,39,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02286,NA,16,142,229,1658,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Spatial density pattern of Himalayan Ibex (Capra sibirica) in Pakistan,"Mountain ungulates perform a key role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems as they are the primary consumers of vegetation and prey for large predators. The mountain ranges of northern Pakistan are home to six species of mountain ungulates, and the Himalayan ibex (Capra sibirica), hereafter ibex, is the most abundant among them. This study was conducted in three adminis-trative regions of northern Pakistan, viz. Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), to generate a range-wide density pattern map of ibex. A double -observer survey was conducted in 25 study sites during 2018-2021 across the ibex distribution range, covering an area of about 35,307 km2, by walking transects totaling 1647 km. Within the ibex range where the survey was not conducted due to financial and logistical constraints, we obtained species population information from local wildlife departments' most recent annual survey data. The aim was to generate a density map for the entire ibex range. Using the BBRe-capture package in program R, we estimated an ibex population of 7639 (95 \% CI) with a mean density of 0.21/km2 in the surveyed area. Combining with the secondary data from un-surveyed areas, the total population estimate for the country came to 10,242 ibex. The largest population densities were observed in four valleys (Shimshal, Gulkin-Hussaini, Khyber, and Khunjerab) of the Karakoram-Pamir range, followed by the Hindu Kush range (Chitral Wildlife Division {[}WD]). The central and eastern parts of the Karakoram range had moderate to low densities, while the Himalayan range (e.g., Astore Valley) supported a small population. The mean herd size was 15 individuals (range: 5-41), and the average detection probability of observers A and B was 0.69 and 0.48, respectively. The average male and young ratios per 100 females were estimated to be 75 and 81, respectively.

GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Can pikas hold the umbrella? Understanding the current and future umbrella potential of keystone species Pika (Ochotona spp.),"The umbrella species concept is a frequently used concept in conservation since the conservation of an umbrella species may benefit other species. Keystone species are often suggested as potential umbrella species, but the validity of this approach remains uncertain. Moreover, climate change can have a multidirectional effect on the distribution of species, in which the distribution of umbrella species can be affected differently than that of beneficiary species. The validity of applying the umbrella species concept in conservation may thus be jeopardised by climate change. This study assessed the potential of two keystone species, the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) and the Daurian pika (Ochotona dauurica), to be umbrella species for 13 potentially beneficiary species under current and future environmental conditions. Of these 13 species, five currently only co-occur with the plateau pika, five only with the Daurian pika, and three with both pika species. Current and future distributions of the pika species and potentially beneficiary species were predicted using bioclimatic and land-use variables. Range overlaps, Pearson correlations, niche similarity tests and relative suitability tests were performed to assess the umbrella potential of both pika species. Our results show that at present, both pika species may be considered to be umbrella species, benefitting several co-occurring species. However, species that currently co-occur with both pika species will not benefit from conservation of either of the pikas in the future years under climate change scenarios. The plateau pika loses its potential to act as umbrella species for two of the four species which currently may benefit. We can conclude that keystone species like pikas can act as umbrella species for carefully selected potentially beneficiary species under current conditions. Due to climate change related shifts in species distributions, they may however lose their umbrella species status in the future, which should be considered when selecting species conservation strategies.",Species distribution modelling; Climate change; Plateau pika; Daurian pika; Keystone species; Umbrella species,2022,38,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02247,NA,18,125,304,2074,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes

The research method was descriptive-correlation which was done using structural equation modeling (SEM). Data gathering instrument was a standard questionnaire whose validity was assessed by convergent validity (CV) and its reliability was assessed by calculating Cronbach's alpha (alpha) and composite reliability (CR).

SEM results showed that perceived severity (PS) and self-efficacy (SE) variables had a direct, positive and significant effect on RWPEB. In addition, the variable of environmental awareness (EnAw) had a positive and significant effect on RWPEB indirectly through PMT components. Therefore, by improving the EnAw, SE and PS status of environmental issues among rural women, it is possible to develop their pro-environmentalist behaviors.

For instance, 87\% (n = 376) of our respondents agreed with the statement ``The knowledge obtained through conservation education is very important in changing our attitude towards protected areas,{''} as well as 71\% (n = 376) of our respondents agreed with the statement that It is important to involve school children in conservation education.{''} We predicted that people in Arusha would be more positive toward all six conservation statements than people in Dodoma (the capital city) because Arusha is close to many protected areas and is a tourist hub. We also predicted that people in Arusha would have more knowledge and awareness of biodiversity conservation than those in Dodoma. However, this prediction was not supported as people from Dodoma were significantly more positive than people from Arusha. This indicates that people in Dodoma are more concerned about biodiversity conservation than people in Arusha. This variation might be influenced by the costs associated with conservation, as people in urban Dodoma live far from conservation challenges such as livestock depredation and/or crop raiding compared to people in urban Arusha.",Conservation awareness; Nature; Protected areas; Urban people,2022,38,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02251,NA,11,89,237,1582,4,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Multiscale spatially explicit modelling of livestock depredation by reintroduced tiger (Panthera tigris) to predict conflict risk probability,"Understanding the causal factors associated with human/livestock-large carnivore conflict and distribution of conflict risk is key to designing effective preventative and mitigation strategies. Spatial modelling of human-carnivore conflict has recently gained traction, and predictive maps have become a great tool to understand the distribution of present and future conflict risk. However, very few such studies consider scale and use appropriate spatial modelling tools. We aimed to understand the ecological correlates of human-tiger (Panthera tigris) conflict, predict livestock predation risk by reintroduced tigers in Panna Tiger Reserve, Central India and un-derstand the prey-predator dynamics behind the conflict. We modelled livestock kill as a function of various tiger relevant ecological variables at multiple scales employing spatially explicit sta-tistical tools. As a first step, we used geostatistical modelling to create raster layers of covariates (prey, cover, human activities), following which we did univariate scaling. We then modelled livestock loss by tiger using a geoadditive model. Employing this model, we predicted and mapped conflict risk probabilities within our study site. It was found that prey and shrub cover both selected at a fine scale, were key ecological determinants of human-tiger conflict. Prey showed an inverse relationship while shrub showed non-linear relationship with livestock pre-dation. Which lead us to conclude that in habitats where optimum ambush cover is available but prey presence is low at fine-scale, carnivores are more likely to depredate domestic livestock since livestock have lost most of their anti-predator behaviours. Livestock kill by tiger is thus a culmination of predator choice and foraging tactics, and prey vulnerability and defence mecha-nism.

The plantation forest had the highest mean trapping success, whereas the lowest trap success was in the Erica woodland. The distribution of rodent species was significantly different among studied habitats. Higher trap success was recorded during the dry season (26.2\%) than in the wet season (24.4\%). The highest value of the Shannon index was recorded in plantation forest (H??? = 1.82) followed by farmland habitat (H??? = 1.67) during the wet season, and the lowest value was observed in the intact forest (H??? = 0.67) and Erica woodland (H??? = 0.67) during the dry season. Of the total sampled individuals, adults comprised 260 (41.9\%), sub-adults 248 (39.9\%) and juveniles 113 (18.2\%).

GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,"Counterfactual assessment of protected area avoided deforestation in Cambodia: Trends in effectiveness, spillover effects and the influence of establishment date","Whilst protected area (PA) networks remain a cornerstone of global conservation efforts, persistent underfunding alongside the increasing severity of environmental degradation has furthered interest in quantifying the ecological benefits they generate. However, the counterfactual assessment of measures of effectiveness, such as avoided deforestation relative to unprotected areas, are confounded by the non-random siting of PAs within landscapes, which creates differential resource extraction pressures. Quasi-experimental techniques such as statistical matching can account for differential pressures by selecting suitable control areas for comparison by minimising variance across a suite of environmental and socio-economic covariates. This study presents a national scale assessment of PA effectiveness for Cambodia, involving 46 PAs, employing nearest-neighbour propensity score matching using 8 covariates, with repeated random sampling, to quantify avoided deforestation in 3 different outcome periods between 2010 and 2018. The results demonstrate that, despite historic criticism, Cambodia's PAs generated significant positive avoided deforestation in all periods, with forested land in PAs being as much as 12.5 \% less likely to be deforested than matched unprotected forest. However, effect size declined over subsequent time periods likely due to a combination of rising deforestation pressure from agri-business concessions, followed by a large-scale expansion of the PA estate and institutional rearrangements. The effectiveness of PAs in Cambodia varied with respect to PA age and a significant positive spillover effect of PAs (maximum of 5.9 \% reduction in deforestation probability) was observed in 2 km buffer zones of increasing distance to PA boundaries. Our findings are consistent with studies of other PA networks that report heterogeneous effects for these phenomena.",Protected area effectiveness; Avoided deforestation; Propensity score matching; Counterfactual; Quasi -experimental; Spillover effects; Cambodia,2022,38,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02228,NA,20,161,259,1897,7,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Biogeography in the deep: Hierarchical population genomic structure of two beaked whale species,"The deep sea is the largest ecosystem on Earth, yet little is known about the processes driving patterns of genetic diversity in its inhabitants. Here, we investigated the macro-and microevo-lutionary processes shaping genomic population structure and diversity in two poorly understood, globally distributed, deep-sea predators: Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) and Blain-ville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris). We used double-digest restriction associated DNA (ddRAD) and whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequencing to characterise genetic patterns using phylogenetic trees, cluster analysis, isolation-by-distance, genetic diversity and differentiation statistics. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Blainville's n = 43 samples, SNPs=13988; Cuvier's n = 123, SNPs= 30479) and mitogenomes (Blainville's n = 27; Cuvier's n = 35) revealed substantial hierarchical structure at a global scale. Both species display significant genetic structure between the Atlantic, Indo-Pacific and in Cuvier's, the Mediterranean Sea. Within major ocean basins, clear differentiation is found between genetic clusters on the east and west sides of the North Atlantic, and some distinct patterns of structure in the Indo-Pacific and Southern Hemisphere. We infer that macroevolutionary processes shaping patterns of genetic diversity include biogeographical barriers, highlighting the importance of such barriers even to highly mobile, deep-diving taxa. The barriers likely differ between the species due to their thermal tolerances and evolutionary histories. On a microevolutionary scale, it seems likely that the balance between resident populations displaying site fidelity, and transient individuals facilitating gene flow, shapes patterns of connectivity and genetic drift in beaked whales. Based on these results, we propose management units to facilitate improved conservation measures for these elusive species.",DdRAD sequencing; Mitogenome sequencing; Phylogenomics; Ziphius cavirostris; Mesoplodon densirostris; Ziphiidae,2022,40,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02308,NA,13,95,256,1933,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,"Observed and forecasted changes in land use by polar bears in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, 1985-2040","Monitoring changes in the distribution of large carnivores is important for managing human safety and supporting conservation. Throughout much of their range, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are increasingly using terrestrial habitats in response to Arctic sea ice decline. Their increased presence in coastal areas has implications for bear-human conflict, inter-species interactions, and polar bear health and survival. We examined observed trends in land use over three decades by polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea (SB) and Chukchi Sea (CS) where bears have traditionally spent most of the year on the sea ice. Using data from 408 adult females fitted with satellite radio-collars, we examined trends in the annual proportion of bears coming onshore (hereafter referred to as ``percent of bears{''}) during the summer for >= 21 days, arrival and departure dates, duration spent onshore and relationships with sea ice metrics. We then estimated future land use through 2040 by extrapolating trends and by combining observed relationships between land use and sea ice with projections of future sea ice from an ensemble of earth system models. The observed percent of bears summering onshore and their duration onshore was correlated with the percent of open water that occurred within their population's range between July and October. As sea ice declined, the percent of bears summering onshore increased from similar to 5-30\% in the SB and similar to 10-50\% in the CS and duration onshore increased by > 30 days to 60-70 days in both populations. Using a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios and adjustments for faster than forecasted sea ice loss we estimated that 50-62\% of SB and 79-88\% of CS bears will spend 90-108 and 110-126 days onshore during summer in the SB and CS, respectively, by 2040. Sea ice projections varied little between greenhouse gas emission scenarios prior to 2040 but diverged thereafter. Observed and forecasted increases in polar bear land occupancy puts more bears in proximity to human activities and settlements for longer durations while extending the lack of access to their primary prey. Because human conflict is one of the primary factors affecting the conservation of large carnivores worldwide, mitigation of bear-human interactions on land will be an increasingly important component of polar bear conservation.",Arctic; Global warming; Human-wildlife conflict; Sea ice; Ursus maritimus,2022,40,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02319,NA,17,102,369,2369,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,"Endozoochorous seed dispersal by Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus) in Taehwa Research Forest, South Korea","Endozoochorous seed dispersal by ungulates can facilitate the dispersal of seeds over long dis-tances. Endozoochorous seed dispersal can also result in the ecological filtering of plant species by dispersing plant seeds with distinctive traits. The Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyr-opus) is a potential long-distance seed dispersal vector in lowland areas of South Korea. In this study, to test the endozoochorous seed dispersal role of Korean water deer in forested areas, we collected 202 fresh fecal pellet group samples in Taehwa Research Forest, Gwangju City, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. Additionally, we conducted a vegetation survey to compare the traits of dispersed seeds from feces with the seed traits of flora in the study site. To test whether the composition of species traits dispersed by endozoochory is consistent with that of lowland areas, which consist of forested hills, arable land, and wetlands, we compared the results with a former study conducted in the lowlands. From the seedling emergence method applied to feces, we found a total of 22 species and 115 seedlings. Among 202 fecal pellet groups, 19.8\% had at least one germinable seed. Species of forbs, with small-sized seeds (<= 2 mm in length), from open habitat, and seeds without special morphology for dispersal are most frequently dispersed through Korean water deer endozoochory. These traits were consistent with the former endo-zoochory study conducted in a lowland area, irrespective of the different available flora. Therefore, we suggest that deer can potentially disperse seeds with the aforementioned traits to forest plant communities, acting as a consistent ecological filter through endozoochory.",Endozoochory; Forest habitat; Korean water deer; Plant -animal interactions; Taehwa Research Forest,2022,40,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02325,NA,16,120,258,1708,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Changes in vegetation types affect soil microbial communities in tropical islands of southern China,"Soil microbial communities are the key drivers of nutrient cycling in ecosystems. However, the functional response of soil microbial community composition to contrasting vegetation types in tropical coral islands is still unclear. Tropical coral islands provide a unique, extreme habitat characterized by higher soil pH and P, but lower N and soil water contents. To determine the responses of soil microbial communities to changes in vegetation types, soil microbial biomass and community composition were investigated by determination of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) under three vegetation types (including tree, shrub, and herb-vine) on Dong Island and Yongxing Island of southern China. Redundancy analysis (RDA) has been used to determine the driving factors (soil properties) for shaping soil microbial community composition. The results showed that the total biomass of PLFAs, as well as the specific microbial taxa {[}such as bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria (G(+)), Gram-negative bacteria (G(-)), fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and actinomycetes] increased in the soils from herb-vine via shrub to tree. Furthermore, along the above vegetation types gradient, the ratios of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria (G(+):G(-)), total saturated to total monounsaturated fatty acids (sat:mono), and fungi to bacteria (F: B) ratio decreased, indicating a shift in soil microbial community towards lower stress and copiotrophic dominance. Our findings indicate that soil microbial groups have a sensitive response to shifting plant communities in tropical coral islands, and soil water content, the ratios of soil organic matter and N content to P content, and soil pH might be the critical drivers of microbial community composition and structure in the study region.",Coral islands; Plant communities; Soil microbial groups; PLEA; Stress indicator,2022,37,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02162,NA,14,99,258,1788,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,"Restoration of urban waterbird diversity: A case study of the construction of a waterbird ecological corridor in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Southern China","Rapid urbanization has intensified habitat fragmentation and shrinkage of waterbirds, threat-ening the sustainable development of waterbird diversity. Urban waterbird restoration can be achieved by considering suburban waterbirds as the source of restoration of urban waterbird diversity and by overcoming the separation between urban and suburban populations. Optimal design of ecological corridors is the most effective approach to facilitate movement of waterbirds. However, three challenges to applying ecological corridors to urban waterbird diversity resto-ration remain: (1)identifying focal species for the ecological corridor network; (2)identifying nodes in the ecological corridor; (3) assigning priority for design of the different areas in the corridor. The aim of this study was to develop methods to resolve these challenges using the design of a waterbird ecological corridor in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in Southern China as a case study. Under the proposed methods, it is hoped that waterbird re-covery will occur in the city, characterized by a complex three-dimensional space, thereby pro-moting an increase in urban waterbird diversity.",Guangdong -Hong Kong -Macao Greater Bay; Area; Waterbirds; Restoration; Habitat suitability; Ecological corridor,2022,39,NA,10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02277,NA,25,175,164,1178,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
HEREDITY,Dissecting the loci underlying maturation timing in Atlantic salmon using haplotype and multi-SNP based association methods,"Characterizing the role of different mutational effect sizes in the evolution of fitness-related traits has been a major goal in evolutionary biology for a century. Such characterization in a diversity of systems, both model and non-model, will help to understand the genetic processes underlying fitness variation. However, well-characterized genetic architectures of such traits in wild populations remain uncommon. In this study, we used haplotype-based and multi-SNP Bayesian association methods with sequencing data for 313 individuals from wild populations to test the mutational composition of known candidate regions for sea age at maturation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We detected an association at five loci out of 116 candidates previously identified in an aquaculture strain with maturation timing in wild Atlantic salmon. We found that at four of these five loci, variation explained by the locus was predominantly driven by a single SNP suggesting the genetic architecture of this trait includes multiple loci with simple, non-clustered alleles and a locus with potentially more complex alleles. This highlights the diversity of genetic architectures that can exist for fitness-related traits. Furthermore, this study provides a useful multi-SNP framework for future work using sequencing data to characterize genetic variation underlying phenotypes in wild populations.",NA,2022,129,6,10.1038/s41437-022-00570-w,0018-067X,16,123,200,1391,NA,NA,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
HEREDITY,Genetics of randomly bred cats support the cradle of cat domestication being in the Near East,"Cat domestication likely initiated as a symbiotic relationship between wildcats (Felis silvestris subspecies) and the peoples of developing agrarian societies in the Fertile Crescent. As humans transitioned from hunter-gatherers to farmers similar to 12,000 years ago, bold wildcats likely capitalized on increased prey density (i.e., rodents). Humans benefited from the cats' predation on these vermin. To refine the site(s) of cat domestication, over 1000 random-bred cats of primarily Eurasian descent were genotyped for single-nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats. The overall cat population structure suggested a single worldwide population with significant isolation by the distance of peripheral subpopulations. The cat population heterozygosity decreased as genetic distance from the proposed cat progenitor's (F.s. lybica) natural habitat increased. Domestic cat origins are focused in the eastern Mediterranean Basin, spreading to nearby islands, and southernly via the Levantine coast into the Nile Valley.

HEREDITY,Immune-mediated competition benefits protective microbes over pathogens in a novel host species,"Microbes that protect against infection inhabit hosts across the tree of life. It is unclear whether and how the host immune system may affect the formation of new protective symbioses. We investigated the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans following novel interactions with a protective microbe (Enterococcus faecalis) able to defend against infection by pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. We have previously shown that E. faecalis can directly limit pathogen growth within hosts. In this study, we show that colonisation by protective E. faecalis caused the differential expression of 1,557 genes in pathogen infected hosts, including the upregulation of immune genes such as lysozymes and C-type lectins. The most significantly upregulated host lysozyme gene, lys-7, impacted the competitive abilities of E. faecalis and S. aureus when knocked out. E. faecalis has an increased ability to resist lysozyme activity compared to S. aureus, suggesting that the protective microbe could gain a competitive advantage from this host response. Our finding that protective microbes can benefit from immune-mediated competition after introduction opens up new possibilities for biocontrol design and our understanding of symbiosis evolution. Crosstalk between the host immune response and microbe-mediated protection should favour the continued investment in host immunity and avoid the potentially risky evolution of host dependence.",NA,2022,129,6,10.1038/s41437-022-00569-3,0018-067X,12,95,204,1441,NA,NA,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

We used microsatellite markers to access the genetic diversity and structure of 26 populations and 527 adult individuals of Euterpe edulis, a native palm which is an important food resource for fauna and is intensively exploited due to economic reasons. We found high genetic diversity and inbreeding in all populations analyzed. We report highest rates of inbreeding for this species, which could reflect the anthropic impacts of selective cutting, fragmentation, and change in foraging behavior from pollinators and less availability and mobility of large dispersers. We detected by STRUCTURE, two genetic groups, Northern and Southern, which divide the Brazilian Atlantic Forest geographically. These groups have low genetic admixtures, but we found a region of lineage hybridization in the contact zone with low recent gene flow. Distribution pattern of this species corroborates results from previous studies reporting the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) have shaped the structuring of the species through movements of forests' expansion and contraction.

In the form of laboratory strains, both inbred and outbred, they are also among the most widely used model organisms in biomedical research. Although the general outlines of house mouse dispersal and population structure are well known, details have been obscured by either limited sample size or small numbers of markers. Here we examine ancestry, population structure, and inbreeding using SNP microarray genotypes in a cohort of 814 wild mice spanning five continents and all major subspecies of Mus, with a focus on M. m. domesticus. We find that the major axis of genetic variation in M. m. domesticus is a south-to-north gradient within Europe and the Mediterranean. The dominant ancestry component in North America, Australia, New Zealand, and various small offshore islands are of northern European origin. Next we show that inbreeding is surprisingly pervasive and highly variable, even between nearby populations.

INSECT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,A molecular phylogeny of the long-horned bees in the genus Melissodes Latreille (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Eucerinae),"The genus Melissodes Latreille in the subfamily Eucerinae (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is a widespread and common group of bees. There are 129 described Melissodes species that range throughout the western hemisphere with the center of diversity in the warm deserts of southwestern North America. Despite its widespread nature and importance in agriculture, the evolutionary relationships among the species have never been investigated. Here, we present a molecular phylogeny using five loci for 89 species of Melissodes with representatives from all subgenera. We confirm all of the subgeneric delineations constructed by LaBerge, except for a paraphyletic M. (Tachymelissodes) and the placement of M. (Heliomelissodes), which renders M.

To explore the evolution of cocoon loss within Formicidae, we perform an ancestral state reconstruction of cocooned pupae across a genus-level phylog-eny and use a sister clade analysis to determine the impact of cocoon evolution on ant speciation. Then, we fit models of correlated evolution between cocoon status and several other organismal traits. We find that the re-emergence of cocoons is rare and that ``naked{''} lineages display an increased rate of speciation in 5 out of 9 sister group comparisons. Models of correlated evolution with cocoon status were favored for metapleural gland and worker polymorphism. Metapleural gland favored rates of evolution were incon-clusive, while worker polymorphism displayed a higher transition rate towards polymorphism coupled with cocoon loss.

INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,Intestinal Microbiome Richness of Coral Reef Damselfishes (Actinopterygii: Pomacentridae),"Fish gastro-intestinal system harbors diverse microbiomes that affect the host's digestion, nutrition, and immunity Despite the great taxonomic diversity of fish, little is understood about fish microbiome and the factors that determine its structure and composition. Damselfish are important coral reef species that play pivotal roles in determining algae and coral population structures of reefs. Broadly, damselfish belong to either of two trophic guilds based on whether they are planktivorous or algae-farming. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the intestinal microbiome of 5 planktivorous and 5 algae-farming damselfish species (Pomacentridae) from the Great Barrier Reef We detected Gammaproteobacteria ASVs belonging to the genus Actinobacillus in 80\% of sampled individuals across the 2 trophic guilds, thus, bacteria in this genus can be considered possible core members of pomacentrid microbiomes. Algae-farming damselfish had greater bacterial alpha-diversity, a more diverse core microbiome and shared 35 +/- 22 ASVs, whereas planktivorous species shared 7 +/- 3 ASVs. Our data also highlight differences in microbiomes associated with both trophic guilds. For instance, algae-farming damselfish were enriched in Pasteurellaceae, whilst planktivorous damselfish in Vibrionaceae. Finally, we show shifts in bacterial community composition along the intestines. ASVs associated with the classes Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and Mollicutes bacteria were predominant in the anterior intestinal regions while Gammaproteobacteria abundance was higher in the stomach.

INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,"Bone Density Variation in Rattails (Macrouridae, Gadiformes): Buoyancy, Depth, Body Size, and Feeding","Synopsis Extreme abiotic factors in deep-sea environments, such as near-freezing temperatures, low light, and high hydrostatic pressure, drive the evolution of adaptations that allow organisms to survive under these conditions. Pelagic and benthopelagic fishes that have invaded the deep sea face physiological challenges from increased compression of gasses at depth, which limits the use of gas cavities as a buoyancy aid. One adaptation observed in deep-sea fishes to increase buoyancy is a decrease of high-density tissues. In this study, we analyze mineralization of high-density skeletal tissue in rattails (family Macrouridae), a group of widespread benthopelagic fishes that occur from surface waters to greater than 7000 m depth. We test the hypothesis that rattail species decrease bone density with increasing habitat depth as an adaptation to maintaining buoyancy while living under high hydrostatic pressures. We performed micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans on 15 species and 20 specimens of rattails and included two standards of known hydroxyapatite concentration (phantoms) to approximate voxel brightness to bone density. Bone density was compared across four bones (eleventh vertebra, lower jaw, pelvic girdle, and first dorsal-fin pterygiophore). On average, the lower jaw was significantly denser than the other bones. We found no correlation between bone density and depth or between bone density and phylogenetic relationships. Instead, we observed that bone density increases with increasing specimen length within and between species. This study adds to the growing body of work that suggests bone density can increase with growth in fishes, and that bone density does not vary in a straightforward way with depth.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac044,NA,13,101,255,1746,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,Reconstructing Articular Cartilage in the Australopithecus afarensis Hip Joint and the Need for Modeling Six Degrees of Freedom,"Synopsis The postcranial skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis (AL 288-1) exhibits clear adaptations for bipedality, although there is some debate as to the efficiency and frequency of such upright movement. Some researchers argue that AL 288-1 walked with an erect limb like modern humans do, whilst others advocate for a ``bent-hip bent-knee{''} (BHBK) gait, although in recent years the general consensus favors erect bipedalism. To date, no quantitative method has addressed the articulation of the AL 288-1 hip joint, nor its range of motion (ROM) with consideration for joint spacing, used as a proxy for the thickness of the articular cartilage present within the joint spacing which can affect how a joint moves. Here, we employed ROM mapping methods to estimate the joint spacing of AL 288-1's hip joint in comparison to a modern human and chimpanzee. Nine simulations assessed different joint spacing and tested the range of joint congruency (i.e., ranging from a closely packed socket to loosely packed). We further evaluated the sphericity of the femoral head and whether three rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs) sufficiently captures the full ROM or if translational DOFs must be included. With both setups, we found that the AL 288-1 hip was unlikely to be highly congruent (as it is in modern humans) because this would severely restrict hip rotational movement and would severely limit the capability for both bipedality and even arboreal locomotion. Rather, the hip was more cartilaginous than it is in the modern humans, permitting the hip to rotate into positions necessitated by both terrestrial and arboreal movements. Rotational-only simulations found that AL 288-1 was unable to extend the hip like modern humans, forcing the specimen to employ a BHBK style of walking, thus contradicting 40+ years of previous research into the locomotory capabilities of AL 288-1. Therefore, we advocate that differences in the sphericity of the AL 288-1 femoral head with that of a modern human necessitates all six DOFs to be included in which AL 288-1 could osteologically extend the hip to facilitate a human-like gait.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac031,NA,18,127,338,2134,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,"The Evolution of Feeding Mechanics in the Danioninae, or Why Giant Danios Don't Suck Like Zebrafish","Synopsis By linking anatomical structure to mechanical performance we can improve our understanding of how selection shapes morphology. Here we examined the functional morphology of feeding in fishes of the subfamily Danioninae (order Cypriniformes) to determine aspects of cranial evolution connected with their trophic diversification. The Danioninae comprise three major lineages and each employs a different feeding strategy. We gathered data on skull form and function from species in each clade, then assessed their evolutionary dynamics using phylogenetic-comparative methods. Differences between clades are strongly associated with differences in jaw protrusion. The paedomorphic Danionella clade does not use jaw protrusion at all, members of the Danio clade use jaw protrusion for suction production and prey capture, and members of the sister clade to Danio (e.g., Devario and Microdevario) use jaw protrusion to retain prey after capture. The shape of the premaxillary bone is a major determinant of protrusion ability, and premaxilla morphology in each of these lineages is consistent with their protrusion strategies. Premaxilla shapes have evolved rapidly, which indicates that they have been subjected to strong selection. We compared premaxilla development in giant danio (Devario aequipinnatus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) and discuss a developmental mechanism that could shift danionine fishes between the feeding strategies employed by these species and their respective clades. We also identified a highly integrated evolutionary module that has been an important factor in the evolution of trophic mechanics within the Danioninae.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac049,NA,16,99,235,1652,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,The Human Neck is Part of the Musculoskeletal Core: Cervical Muscles Help Stabilize the Pelvis During Running and Jumping,"Synopsis During locomotion, cervical muscles must be active to stabilize the head as the body accelerates and decelerates. We hypothesized that cervical muscles are also part of the linked chain of axial muscles that provide core stabilization against torques applied to the hip joint by the extrinsic muscles of the legs. To test whether specific cervical muscles play a role in postural stabilization of the head and/or core stabilization of the pelvic girdle, we used surface electromyography to measure changes in muscle activity in response to force manipulations during constant speed running and maximum effort counter-movement jumps. We found that doubling the mass of the head during both running and maximum effort jumping had little or no effect on (1) acceleration of the body and (2) cervical muscle activity. Application of horizontal forward and rearward directed forces at the pelvis during running tripled mean fore and aft accelerations, thereby increasing both the pitching moments on the head and flexion and extension torques applied to the hip. These manipulations primarily resulted in increases in cervical muscle activity that is appropriate for core stabilization of the pelvis. Additionally, when subjects jumped maximally with an applied downward directed force that reduced acceleration and therefore need for cervical muscles to stabilize the head, cervical muscle activity did not decrease. These results suggest that during locomotion, rather than acting to stabilize the head against the effects of inertia, the superficial muscles of the neck monitored in this study help to stabilize the pelvis against torques imposed by the extrinsic muscles of the legs at the hip joint. We suggest that a division of labor may exist between deep cervical muscles that presumably provide postural stabilization of the head versus superficial cervical muscles that provide core stabilization against torques applied to the pelvic and pectoral girdles by the extrinsic appendicular muscles.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac021,NA,19,121,305,2009,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,The Effect of Thermally Robust Ballistic Mechanisms on Climatic Niche in Salamanders,"Synopsis Many organismal functions are temperature-dependent due to the contractile properties of muscle. Spring-based mechanisms offer a thermally robust alternative to temperature-sensitive muscular movements and may correspondingly expand a species' climatic niche by partially decoupling the relationship between temperature and performance. Using the ballistic tongues of salamanders as a case study, we explore whether the thermal robustness of elastic feeding mechanisms increases climatic niche breadth, expands geographic range size, and alters the dynamics of niche evolution. Combining phylogenetic comparative methods with global climate data, we find that the feeding mechanism imparts no discernable signal on either climatic niche properties or the evolutionary dynamics of most climatic niche parameters. Although biomechanical innovation in feeding influences many features of whole-organism performance, it does not appear to drive macro-climatic niche evolution in salamanders. We recommend that future work incorporate micro-scale environmental data to better capture the conditions that salamanders experience, and we discuss a few outstanding questions in this regard. Overall, this study lays the groundwork for an investigation into the evolutionary relationships between climatic niche and biomechanical traits in ectotherms.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac020,NA,12,84,178,1350,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,Long-Axis Rotation of Jaws of Bamboo Sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) During Suction Feeding,"Synopsis Long-axis rotation (LAR) of the jaws may be an important component of vertebrate feeding mechanisms, as it has been hypothesized to occur during prey capture or food processing across diverse vertebrate groups including mammals, ray-finned fishes, and sharks and rays. LAR can affect tooth orientation as well as muscle fiber direction and therefore muscle power during feeding. However, to date only a handful of studies have demonstrated this LAR in vivo. Here, we use XROMM to document LAR of the upper and lower jaws in white-spotted bamboo sharks, Chiloscyllium plagiosum, during suction feeding. As the lower jaw begins to depress for suction expansion, both the upper jaw (palatoquadrate) and lower jaw (Meckel's cartilage) evert, such that their toothed surfaces move laterally, and then they invert with jaw closing. Eversion has been shown to tense the dental ligament and erect the teeth in some sharks, but it is not clear how this tooth erection would contribute to suction feeding in bamboo sharks. Two recent XROMM studies have shown LAR of the lower jaws during mastication in mammals and stingrays and our study extends LAR to suction feeding and confirms its presence in shark species. Examples of LAR of the jaws are becoming increasingly widespread across vertebrates with unfused mandibular symphyses. Unfused lower jaws are the plesiomorphic condition for most vertebrate lineages and therefore LAR may be a common component of jaw mechanics unless the mandibular symphysis is fused.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac024,NA,12,92,238,1514,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,Serial Homology and Segment Identity in the Arthropod Head,"Synopsis The anterior-most unit of the crown-group arthropod body plan includes three segments, the pre-gnathal segments, that contain three neuromeres that together comprise the brain. Recent work on the development of this anterior region has shown that its three units exhibit many developmental differences to the more posterior segments, to the extent that they should not be considered serial homologs. Building on this revised understanding of the development of the pre-gnathal segments, we suggest a novel scenario for arthropod head evolution. We posit an expansion of an ancestral single-segmented head at the transition from Radiodonta to Deuteropoda in the arthropod stem group. The expanded head subdivided into three segmental units, each maintaining some of the structures of the ancestral head. This scenario is consistent with what we know of head evolution from the fossil record and helps reconcile some of the debates about early arthropod evolution.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac015,NA,9,58,146,971,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,Elevated Salinity Rapidly Confers Cross-Tolerance to High Temperature in a Splash-Pool Copepod,"Synopsis Accurate forecasting of organismal responses to climate change requires a deep mechanistic understanding of how physiology responds to present-day variation in the physical environment. However, the road to physiological enlightenment is fraught with complications: predictable environmental fluctuations of any single factor are often accompanied by substantial stochastic variation and rare extreme events, and several factors may interact to affect physiology. Lacking sufficient knowledge of temporal patterns of co-variation in multiple environmental stressors, biologists struggle to design and implement realistic and relevant laboratory experiments. In this study, we directly address these issues, using measurements of the thermal tolerance of freshly collected animals and long-term field records of environmental conditions to explore how the splash-pool copepod Tigriopus californicus adjusts its physiology as its environment changes. Salinity and daily maximum temperature-two dominant environmental stressors experienced by T. californicus-are extraordinarily variable and unpredictable more than 2-3 days in advance. However, they substantially co-vary such that when temperature is high salinity is also likely to be high. Copepods appear to take advantage of this correlation: median lethal temperature of field-collected copepods increases by 7.5 degrees C over a roughly 120 parts-per-thousand range of ambient salinity. Complementary laboratory experiments show that exposure to a single sublethal thermal event or to an abrupt shift in salinity also elicits rapid augmentation of heat tolerance via physiological plasticity, although the effect of salinity dwarfs that of temperature. These results suggest that T. californicus's physiology keeps pace with the rapid, unpredictable fluctuations of its hypervariable physical environment by responding to the cues provided by recent sublethal stress and, more importantly, by leveraging the mechanistic cross-talk between responses to salinity and heat stress.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac037,NA,12,94,273,2041,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,"A Tunable, Simplified Model for Biological Latch Mediated Spring Actuated Systems","Synopsis We develop a model of latch-mediated spring actuated (LaMSA) systems relevant to comparative biomechanics and bioinspired design. The model contains five components: two motors (muscles), a spring, a latch, and a load mass. One motor loads the spring to store elastic energy and the second motor subsequently removes the latch, which releases the spring and causes movement of the load mass. We develop freely available software to accompany the model, which provides an extensible framework for simulating LaMSA systems. Output from the simulation includes information from the loading and release phases of motion, which can be used to calculate kinematic performance metrics that are important for biomechanical function. In parallel, we simulate a comparable, directly actuated system that uses the same motor and mass combinations as the LaMSA simulations. By rapidly iterating through biologically relevant input parameters to the model, simulated kinematic performance differences between LaMSA and directly actuated systems can be used to explore the evolutionary dynamics of biological LaMSA systems and uncover design principles for bioinspired LaMSA systems. As proof of principle of this concept, we compare a LaMSA simulation to a directly actuated simulation that includes either a Hill-type force-velocity trade-off or muscle activation dynamics, or both. For the biologically-relevant range of parameters explored, we find that the muscle force-velocity trade-off and muscle activation have similar effects on directly actuated performance. Including both of these dynamic muscle properties increases the accelerated mass range where a LaMSA system outperforms a directly actuated one.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac032,NA,11,81,246,1710,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,Masculinized Sexual Ornaments in Female Lizards Correlate with Ornament-Enhancing Thermoregulatory Behavior,"Synopsis The adaptive significance of colorful or exaggerated traits (i.e., ornaments) expressed in females is often unclear. Competing hypotheses suggest that expression of female ornaments arises from maladaptive (or neutral) genetic inheritance from males along with incomplete epigenetic regulation, or from positive selection for ornaments in females under social competition. Whether costly or advantageous, the visibility of such traits can sometimes be behaviorally modulated in order to maximize fitness. Female eastern fence lizards express blue badges that are variable in size and color saturation. These are rudimentary compared to those seen in males and carry important costs such as reduced mating opportunities. Body temperature is a well-established enhancer of badge color, and thus thermoregulation may be one way these animals modulate badge visibility. We quantified realized body temperatures of female lizards paired in laboratory trials and observed that females with larger badges attained higher body temperatures when freely allowed to thermoregulate, sometimes beyond physiological optima. In this association between phenotype and behavior, females with larger badges exhibited thermoregulatory patterns that increase their badges' visibility. This signal-enhancing behavior is difficult to reconcile with the widely held view that female ornaments are maladaptive, suggesting they may carry context-dependent social benefits.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac029,NA,11,107,198,1456,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,Corn Snakes Show Consistent Sarcomere Length Ranges Across Muscle Groups and Ontogeny,"The force-generating capacity of muscle depends upon many factors including the actin-myosin filament overlap due to the relative length of the sarcomere. Consequently, the force output of a muscle may vary throughout its range of motion, and the body posture allowing maximum force generation may differ even in otherwise similar species. We hypothesized that corn snakes would show an ontogenetic shift in sarcomere length range from being centered on the plateau of the length-tension curve in small individuals to being on the descending limb in adults. Sarcomere lengths across the plateau would be advantageous for locomotion, while the descending limb would be advantageous for constriction due to the increase in force as the coil tightens around the prey. To test this hypothesis, we collected sarcomere lengths from freshly euthanized corn snakes, preserving segments in straight and maximally curved postures, and quantifying sarcomere length via light microscopy. We dissected 7 muscles (spinalis, semispinalis, multifidus, longissimus dorsi, iliocostalis (dorsal and ventral), and levator costae) in an ontogenetic series of corn snakes (mass = 80-335 g) at multiple regions along the body (anterior, middle, and posterior). Our data shows all of the muscles analyzed are on the descending limb of the length-tension curve at rest across all masses, regions, and muscles analyzed, with muscles shortening onto or past the plateau when flexed. While these results are consistent with being advantageous for constriction at all sizes, there could also be unknown benefits of this sarcomere arrangement for locomotion or striking.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac040,NA,12,85,246,1640,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,Extraoral Taste Buds on the Paired Fins of Damselfishes,"Some fish species have taste buds on the surface of their bodies and fins, as well as in the oral cavity. The extraoral taste system of fish has traditionally been studied in species that inhabit environments and/or employ feeding strategies where vision is limited. Here we examined taste sensation in a new ecological context by investigating the paired fins of damselfish (Pomacentridae), a group of diurnal midwater fishes that inhabit the light-rich waters of coral reefs. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of taste buds on the paired fins of Chromis viridis, including on the distal tips of elongate leading-edge pelvic fin rays, where they are particularly densely packed, suggesting specialization for chemosensation. Similar anatomical results were also recorded from two other species, Pomacentrus amboinensis and Pomacentrus coelestis. We found that afferent pectoral fin nerves of C. viridis responded to a food-derived stimulus. By investigating the extraoral taste system in a new phylogenetic and ecological context, these results show that taste buds on fins are more widespread amongst fish than previously known and are present even in highly visual environments.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac035,NA,9,55,178,1194,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,Phylogenetics of Archerfishes (Toxotidae) and Evolution of the Toxotid Shooting Apparatus,"Archerfishes (Toxotidae) are variously found in the fresh- and brackish-water environments of Asia Pacific and are well known for their ability to shoot water at terrestrial prey. These shots of water are intended to strike their prey and cause it to fall into the water for capture and consumption. While this behavior is well known, there are competing hypotheses (blowpipe vs. pressure tank hypothesis) of how archerfishes shoot and which oral structures are involved. Current understanding of archerfish shooting structures is largely based on two species, Toxotes chatareus and T. jaculatrix. We do not know if all archerfishes possess the same oral structures to shoot water, if anatomical variation is present within these oral structures, or how these features have evolved. Additionally, there is little information on the evolution of the Toxotidae as a whole, with all previous systematic works focusing on the interrelationships of the family. We first investigate the limits of archerfish species using new and previously published genetic data. Our analyses highlight that the current taxonomy of archerfishes does not conform to the relationships we recover. Toxotes mekongensis and T. siamensis are placed in the synonymy of T. chatareus, Toxotes carpentariensis is recognized as a species and removed from the synonymy of T. chatareus, and the genus Protoxotes is recognized for T. lorentzi based on the results of our analyses. We then take an integrative approach, using a combined analysis of discrete hard- and soft-tissue morphological characters with genetic data, to construct a phylogeny of the Toxotidae. Using the resulting phylogenetic hypothesis, we then characterize the evolutionary history and anatomical variation within the archerfishes. We discuss variation in the oral structures and the evolution of the mechanism with respect to the interrelationships of archerfishes, and find that the oral structures of archerfishes support the blowpipe hypothesis but soft-tissue oral structures may also play a role in shooting. Finally, by comparing the morphology of archerfishes to their sister group, we find that the Leptobramidae has relevant shooting features in the oral cavity, suggesting that some components of the archerfish shooting mechanism are examples of co-opted or exapted traits.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac013,NA,11,89,350,2325,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,Proteomic and Transcriptomic Analyses in the Slipper Snail Crepidulafornicata Uncover Shell Matrix Genes Expressed During Adult and Larval Biomineralization,"Synopsis The gastropod shell is a composite composed of minerals and shell matrix proteins (SMPs). SMPs have been identified by proteomics in many molluscs, but few have been studied in detail. Open questions include (1) what gene regulatory networks regulate SMP expression, (2) what roles individual SMPs play in biomineralization, and (3) how the complement of SMPs changes over development. These questions are best addressed in a species in which gene perturbation studies are available; one such species is the slipper snail, Crepidula fornicata. Here, SEM and pXRD analysis demonstrated that the adult shell of C. fornicata exhibits crossed lamellar microstructure and is composed of aragonite. Using high-throughput proteomics we identified 185 SMPs occluded within the adult shell. Over half of the proteins in the shell proteome have known biomineralization domains, while at least 10\% have no homologs in public databases. Differential gene expression analysis identified 20 SMP genes that are up-regulated in the shell-producing mantle tissue. Over half of these 20 SMPs are expressed during development with two, CfSMP1 and CfSMP2, expressed exclusively in the shell gland. Together, the description of the shell microstructure and a list of SMPs now sets the stage for studying the consequences of SMP gene knockdowns in molluscs.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac023,NA,19,156,204,1345,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,"Scaling Relationships of Maximal Gape in Two Species of Large Invasive Snakes, Brown Treesnakes and Burmese Pythons, and Implications for Maximal Prey Size","Synopsis Snakes are a phylogenetically diverse (> 3500 species) clade of gape-limited predators that consume diverse prey and have considerable ontogenetic and interspecific variation in size, but empirical data on maximal gape are very limited. To test how overall size predicts gape, we quantified the scaling relationships between maximal gape, overall size, and several cranial dimensions for a wide range of sizes (mass 8-64,100 g) for two large, invasive snake species: Burmese pythons (Python molorus bivittatus) and brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis). Although skull size scaled with negative allometry relative to overall size, isometry and positive allometry commonly occurred for other measurements. For similar snout-vent lengths (SVL), the maximal gape areas of Burmese pythons were approximately 4-6 times greater than those of brown treesnakes, mainly as a result of having a significantly larger relative contribution to gape by the intermandibular soft tissues (43\% vs. 17\%). In both snake species and for all types of prey, the scaling relationships predicted that relative prey mass (RPM) at maximal gape decreased precipitously with increased overall snake size. For a given SVL or mass, the predicted maximal values of RPM of the Burmese pythons exceeded those of brown treesnakes for all prey types, and predicted values of RPM were usually least for chickens, greatest for limbed reptiles and intermediate for mammals. The pythons we studied are noteworthy for having large overall size and gape that is large even after correcting for overall size, both of which could facilitate some large individuals (SVL = 5 m) exploiting very large vertebrate prey (e.g., deer > 50 kg). Although brown treesnakes had longer quadrate bones, Burmese pythons had larger absolute and larger relative gape as a combined result of larger overall size, larger relative head size, and most importantly, greater stretch of the soft tissues.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac033,NA,23,155,297,1947,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,"Size at Birth, Postnatal Growth, and Reproductive Timing in an Australian Microbat","Synopsis Reproductive phenology, size at birth, and postnatal growth are important life history traits that reflect parental investment. The ability to document detailed changes in these traits can be a valuable tool in the identification and management of at-risk wildlife populations. We examined reproductive traits in a common, widespread Australian microbat, Chalinolobus gouldii, at two sites over two years and derived growth curves and age estimation equations which will be useful in the study of how intrinsic and extrinsic factors alter parental investment strategies. We found that male and female offspring did not differ significantly in their size at birth or their postnatal growth rates. Bats born in 2018 were smaller at birth but grew at a faster rate than those born in 2017. When date of birth was compared across sites and years, we found bats born in 2018 had a later median birthdate (by 18 days) and births were more widespread than those born in 2017. Cooler and wetter weather during late gestation (Nov) in 2018 may have prolonged gestation and delayed births. With many bats facing threatening processes it is important to study reproductive plasticity in common and widespread ``model{''} species, which may assist in the conservation and management of threatened microbats with similar reproductive traits.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac030,NA,12,82,209,1337,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,Species-Specific Expression of Growth-Regulatory Genes in 2 Anoles with Divergent Patterns of Sexual Size Dimorphism,"Synopsis Sexual size dimorphism is widespread in nature and often develops through sexual divergence in growth trajectories. In vertebrates, the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) network is an important regulator of growth, and components of this network are often regulated in sex-specific fashion during the development of sexual size dimorphism. However, expression of the GH/IGF network is not well characterized outside of mammalian model systems, and the extent to which species differences in sexual size dimorphism are related to differences in GH/IGF network expression is unclear. To begin bridging this gap, we compared GH/IGF network expression in liver and muscle from 2 lizard congeners, one with extreme male-biased sexual size dimorphism (brown anole, Anolis sagrei), and one that is sexually monomorphic in size (slender anole, A. apletophallus). Specifically, we tested whether GH/IGF network expression in adult slender anoles resembles the highly sex-biased expression observed in adult brown anoles or the relatively unbiased expression observed in juvenile brown anoles. We found that adults of the 2 species differed significantly in the strength of sex-biased expression for several key upstream genes in the GH/IGF network, including insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2. However, species differences in sex-biased expression were minor when comparing adult slender anoles to juvenile brown anoles. Moreover, the multivariate expression of the entire GH/IGF network (as represented by the first two principal components describing network expression) was sex-biased for the liver and muscle of adult brown anoles, but not for either tissue in juvenile brown anoles or adult slender anoles. Our work suggests that species differences in sex-biased expression of genes in the GH/IGF network (particularly in the liver) may contribute to the evolution of species differences in sexual size dimorphism.",NA,2022,4,1,10.1093/iob/obac025,NA,15,116,282,1939,NA,14,400,NA,No,425,375,no,yes,yes

In the present paper, the juveniles of Bolbosoma nipponicum Yamaguti, 1939 collected from the northern fur seal Callorhinus ursinus (Linnaeus) (Mammalia: Carnivora) in Alaska, USA were precisely identified based on morphological characters and genetic data. Their detailed morphology was studied using light and, for the first time, scanning electron microscopy. The molecular characterization of the nuclear genes {[}small ribosomal subunit (18S) and large ribosomal subunit (28S)] and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) sequence data of B. nipponicum are provided for the first time. Moreover, in order to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Bolbosoma and the other genera in the family Polymorphidae, phylogenetic analyses were performed integrating different nuclear (18S + ITS+28S) and mitochondrial (cox1) sequence data using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). The phylogenetic results showed that Bolbosoma has a sister relationship with Corynosoma, and also revealed that Southwellina is sister to Ibirhynchus + Hexaglandula. Our molecular phylogeny also indicated a possible host-switch pattern during the evolution of the polymorphid acanthocephalans.

Among several causes, an increased prevalence and intensity of the nematode Contracaecum osculatum has been discussed. This increase has been attributed to a population increase of the parasites final host, the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). Other studies have looked at the role of Contracaecum osculatum on cod growth and condition on recently caught cod, or done short term experimental studies in lab. This study instead investigated the importance of Contracaecum osculatum for cod growth in a sea pen based experiment, where cod were kept and fed in order to monitor growth. The results show that a higher density (number of nematodes per gram liver) decreases cod growth potential. If the number of nematodes exceeded 8 per gram liver cod did not grow in length, even when given generous amounts of food.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE,Study of the helminth fauna in eagle owl (Bubo bubo) in the south of Spain,"In this study we show the results of the eagle owls' (Bubo bubo) helminthfauna found in Andalusia. A total number of 50 specimens have been analysed in a period of 10 years (from 2011 to 2020). Prevalence (P-\%), mean intensity (I-M) and mean abundance (A(M)) of parasitation have been obtained. The percentage of parasitation in the total sample was 80\% (40 out of 50 eagle owls): 78\% nematodes, 8\% trematodes, 6\% cestodes and 4\% acantocephalans. 7 species of helminths were identified: 6 nematodes, and 1 trematode. In the case of cestodes and acantocephalans it was not possible to determine species and only the genus was identified. The intestinal nematode Capillaria tenuissima (P-\% = 58\% (44-71.2); I-M = 11,52 (5.83-28.9)) was the core species whereas Synhimantus laticeps (P\% = 16 (7.5-28.8); I-M = 4 (1.75-7.25)) and Hartertia hispanica (P\% = 16 (7.5-28.8); I-M = 1,5 (1-2)) were the secondary species. The remainder species were considered satellite species, with low prevalence and average abundance. Likewise, descriptive parameters of the helminth community were determined: species richness, 1.56 (1.29-1.94), total abundance, 12 (7.24-26.40), Brillouin's diversity index, 0.18 (0.10-0.29) and Berger-Parker dominance index, 0.88 (0.81-0.93). The data from this study show a non-diverse helminthic community, without species dominance with C. tenuissima as the central species, followed by S. laticeps and H. hispanica as secondary species.

In this island lives a brown hare population which, according to the literature, belongs to the ancestral taxon Lepus europaeus meridei that offers a unique opportunity to observe how the parasite biocoenosis shapes in condition of isolation, limited space availability and high population density. The aim of this work is to describe the helminth component community of a non-managed, isolated, and dense hare population, evaluating host-parasite relationship and parasite community structure. All 26 analyzed hares (13 males and 13 females) were in good physical conditions, and all of them harboured exclusively the nematode Protostrongylus oryctolagi only. This is the first report of this lungworm species in Italy. The estimated overall abundance was 48.15 worms per examined hare (range 3-258, median 50) and the parasites were unevenly distributed across host population, with few hosts having most parasites (aggregated or overdispersed distribution). No significant relationship was detected between the number of isolated parasites and hare sex and weigh. The effect of the isolation of Pianosa's hare population seems to have acted reducing parasite richness, while the high host density is probably the cause of the high prevalence and abundance of the single helminth species collected.

Besides the direct impact through land use change, intensive agriculture can also have an indirect impact, for example by changing wildlife epidemiology. We review here the potential effects of mass-flowering crops (MFCs), which are rapidly expanding in global cropping area, on the epidemiology of known pathogens in bee pollinators. We bring together the fifty MFCs with largest global area harvested and give an overview of their pollination dependency as well as their impact on bee pollinators. When in bloom these crops provide an abundance of flowers, which can provide nutrition for bees and increase bee reproduction. After their short bloom peak, however, the fields turn into green deserts. These big changes in floral availability strongly affect the plant-pollinator network, which in turn affects the pathogen transmission network, mediated by shared flowers. We address this dual role of flowers provided by MFCs, serving as nutritional resources as well as pathogen transmission spots, and bring together the current knowledge to assess how MFCs could affect pathogen prevalence in bee pollinator communities.",Mass-flowering crops; Pathogen transmission; Host-pathogen interaction; Intensive agriculture,2022,18,NA,10.1016/j.ijppaw.2022.05.001,2213-2244,9,59,188,1259,4,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE,"The complete mitochondrial genome of Platygaster robiniae (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae): A novel tRNA secondary structure, gene rearrangements and phylogenetic implications","Platygaster robiniae is economically important as a highly specific parasitoid of the invasive pest Obolodiplosis robiniae which was introduced into the Euro-Asia region in the last decade. Despite being a critical and specific parasitoid of the invasive pest O. robiniae and its use as an effective biocontrol agent, the absence of sequence information from P. robiniae have limited its genetic applications for pest management in forests. Mitochondrial (mt) genomes generally contain abundant nucleotide information and thus are helpful for understanding species history. Here, we sequenced the complete mt genome of P. robiniae using next generation sequencing, and an-notated 13 protein-coding, 22 tRNA, and 2 rRNA genes and a 702 bp noncoding region. Comparative analysis indicated that this mt genome has a normal A + T content and codons use, however possessed both the expected and unique rearrangements. Ten tRNAs at four gene blocks COII-ATP8, COIII-ND3, ND3-ND5 and the A +T-rich region-ND2 were rearranged, including gene shuffles, transpositions and inversions. Notably, two genes tRNA(Ser)((UCN)) and tRNA(Leu(CUN)) had undergone long-range inversions, which is the first record of this rearrangement type in the superfamily Platygastroidea. The D-loops of both tRNA(Ile) and tRNA(Leu(CUN)) were absent from the tRNA secondary structure, which has not been reported from hymenopteran previously. Phylogenetic analysis based with the maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods showed that P. robiniae grouped with other species of Platygastridae, and that the superfamily Platygastridea is sister to the other Proctotrupomorpha superfamilies. Our tree strongly supports the monophyly of the five superfamilies of Proctotrupomorpha. This study discovered some unique characters of P. robiniae, and contributes to our understanding of genome rearrangements in the order Hymenoptera.",Platygaster robiniae; Mitochondrial genome; Gene rearrangement,2022,18,NA,10.1016/j.ijppaw.2022.06.007,2213-2244,19,172,269,1890,3,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

This is the case of species of the enigmatic genus Ithyoclinostomum Witenberg, 1926, until recently monotypic and restricted to South America, but with its occurrence expanded to North America after the description of I. yamagutii Rosser et al., 2020. Nevertheless, molecular data for the type species of the genus, Ithyoclinostomum dimorphum (Diesing, 1850), is lacking so far. In the present study, large clinos-tomid metacercariae morphologically indistinguishable from I. dimorphum were obtained from two erythrinid fishes from the Rio Doce River, Southeast Brazil. Samples of the parasites were subjected to a multigene (28S rDNA, ITS and cox1) molecular characterization followed by phylogenetic reconstructions. Phylogenies based on single-gene and concatenated datasets revealed unequivocally that I. dimorphum falls in a well-supported clade together with species of the genus Clinostomum. Moreover, the molecular divergences observed in relation to Clinostomum spp. {[}ranges of 2.4-6\%, 2.4-3.8\% and 14.7-19.3\% for the ITS, 28S and cox1 genes, respectively] are compatible with a congeneric status with these species. Therefore, the genus Ithyoclinostomum is here synony-mized with Clinostomum Leidy, 1856 and C. dimorphum (Diesing, 1850) Braun, 1899 re-established. In the phylogenetic analysis, the recently described `Ithyoclinostomum' yamagutii, presented as an isolated, independent lineage, showing significant molecular divergences to C. dimorphum (12.6\%, 7.6\%, 18,6\% for the ITS, 28S and cox1 genes, respectively). However, given the complex scenario raised in the morphology-based taxonomy of Clinostomidae, we took a conservative approach by not proposing a new genus to `I.' yamagutii until molecular data of other clinostomid genus from birds, Clinostomatopsis, become available. Data here presented reveals that body size is not a useful criterion for higher-level classification in Clinostomidae.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE,Plasmodium relictum MSP-1 capture antigen-based ELISA for detection of avian malaria antibodies in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus),"Avian malaria, caused by Plasmodium spp. and transmitted by mosquitos, is a leading cause of mortality of captive penguins. Antimalarial drugs are currently used to control infections in penguins. However, the effec-tiveness of treatment reduces significantly by the time the clinical signs appear, while early and unnecessary treatment interferes with development of protective immunity. Therefore, for suppressing parasitemia without affecting the development of immunity in captive penguins, antimalaria drugs need to be administered at the right time, which requires reliable diagnostic tools that can determine the levels of circulating antimalaria an-tibodies. In the present study, we have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) diagnostic assay based on the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) of P. relictum isolate SGS1 to specifically detect and relatively quantify antimalaria antibodies in penguins. We expressed and purified a truncated P. relictum isolate SGS1 MSP-1 and optimized its biotinylation and subsequent conjugation to streptavidin alkaline phosphatase for signal generation in ELISA. We tested the assay by analyzing sera obtained from penguins at the Baltimore Zoo, from Spring through Fall, and found that levels of detectable antibodies against MSP-1 varied seasonally for individual penguins, consistent with the expected seasonal variations in avian malaria prevalence. Corrobo-ratively, we analyzed the sensitivity of the assay by titrating positive sera and found that the signal intensity generated was serum concentration-dependent, thus validating the ability of the assay to detect and relatively quantify the levels of antimalaria antibodies in penguin sera.",Plasmodium relictum; ELISA; Anti -malaria antibodies; Captive African penguins,2022,19,NA,10.1016/j.ijppaw.2022.08.009,2213-2244,17,137,239,1712,4,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

The present work characterizes and compares the histological aspects of the liver, gallbladder, and intestine of non-parasitized and parasitized Myotis nigricans by digeneans. Ten specimens of Myotis nigricans collected in an urban area of Western Amazonia were analyzed for parasites. The digeneans were removed from the hosts and identified. Tissue samples of the liver, gallbladder, and intestines of parasitized and non-parasitized hosts were collected for histological studies. The gallbladder was observed in repletion and presents mucosa formed by simple epithelium that varies from cubic to cylindrical. The hepatic lobes do not have a classic polyhedral-hexagonal aspect. Variations in basophilia, acidophile, and cytoplasmatic granulations were observed in hepatocytes. The parasitism of the intestinal digeneans was restricted to space delimited by the extensions of villi in high association with the intestinal epithelium, not invading the region of the intestinal glands at the base of the villi. Trematodes maintained attached to the villus by the oral sucker and acetabulum, connected by a ``pleat{'' composed of epithelium and lamina propria layers.

In this study, the complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes of D. japonicus and D. mehari were sequenced, then compared with other related trematodes in the superfamily Paramphistomoidea. The complete circular mt sequence of D. japonicus and D. mehari were 14,210 bp and 14,179 bp in length, respectively. Both mt genomes comprised 36 functional subunits, consisting of 12 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and one non-coding region. The mt genes of D. japonicus and D. mehari were transcribed in the same direction, and the gene arrangements were identical to those of Paramphistomoidea trematodes. In the 12 PCGs, GTG was the most common initiation codon, whereas TAG was the most common termination codon. All tRNAs had a typical cloverleaf structure except tRNA Ser1. A comparison with related Paramphistomoidea trematode mt genomes suggested that the cox1 gene of D. mehari was the longest in these trematodes.

Evidence using quantile ARDL measures,"India is a major developing world economy that has predominantly been highly energy-intensive and fossil fuel dependent. Consequently, this South Asian nation has not been able to safeguard its environment from persistent degradation through the discharge of greenhouse gases. Accordingly, this study tries to reveal the relationships between Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions, renewable energy consumption, international trade, and economic growth in India in order to recommend policies that can help the nation attain carbon neutrality. Both the conventional Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and the newly developed Quantile ARDL (QARDL) models are used in this study. The ARDL results unveil that 1\% increase in renewable energy consumption contributes to 0.8\% reduction in CO2 emissions, while economic growth boosts CO2 emissions in the long run. Besides, international trade deteriorates the environment by amplifying emissions only in the short run. The QARDL results reveal that economic growth positively and renewable energy consumption negatively affect CO2 emissions across all quantiles of CO2 emissions. In contrast, international trade is not found to exert any statistically significant effect on CO2 emissions. Lastly, the quantile-based causality analysis somewhat supports the regression findings by verifying causal associations between the variables of concern in India's context.

Family farms' socio-economic organizations can explain the adoption conditions of agroecology in these regions, and its success or failure. From data collected in the Niayes region in Senegal, we develop a typology of farms with different levels of agroecology, from none to advanced adoption, based on a Factor Analysis on Mixed Data (FAMD). It allows for characterizing how these levels relate to farm income, labor types, and off-farm activities, among others. Our results confirm the existence of an association between agroecology/family farming and conventional/employer forms of agriculture, as suggested by our hypothesis. However, they bring to light contrasted models that nuance the common archetypes linking family farming with agroecology.

This study employed the most recent Global Reporting Initiative and religious sustainability indicators to establish the measurement framework for evaluating sustainability reporting in relation to the SDGs. Centering on the Malaysian Islamic banks, this study found that overall performance on corporate sustainability reporting is quite low, though it has increased over time from 2011-2020. The bank-wise analysis implies that the SDGs reporting differs for Islamic banks, where most of the banks outperform on SDGs disclosure scores. Further, the SDG-wise analysis indicates that SDG-9, SDG-17, SDG-11, and SDG-1 appear to have the highest disclosure scores. Nevertheless, SDG-16 revealed the least SDG disclosure score, indicating that the sampled Islamic banks do not provide complete information about addressing sustainability-related issues.

Unlike previous studies that only capture one dimension of off-farm work, in this study, we consider multiple dimensions, including off-farm work participation status of household heads, location choices (local or migrated off-farm work), and off-farm work intensity. We employ the stochastic frontier production model to estimate the TE of wheat production and a two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) approach to address the endogeneity of the off-farm work variables. We find that: (1) household heads' off-farm work participation significantly increases TE of wheat production; (2) local (rather than migrated) off-farm work participation significantly increases TE; (3) off-farm work intensity significantly increases TE when household heads work off the farm for more than 9 months. Additional analysis reveals that off-farm work participation of household heads, rather than other members, plays a significant role in improving the TE of wheat production.",Off-farm work; technical efficiency; two-stage residual inclusion; wheat production; China,2023,30,3,10.1080/13504509.2022.2142316,1350-4509,17,123,162,1121,5,NA,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

This study examines the role of shadow economy and financial development in addition to economic growth, trade openness, and urbanization on the environmental sustainability of a panel of 30 African countries from 1991 to 2017. Specifically, the study investigates the effect of these variables on African countries' ecological footprint and bio-capacity. Findings based on the augmented mean group estimator reveal that shadow economy, financial development, economic growth, and urbanization intensify ecological footprint, while trade openness reduces it. Further investigations reveal that shadow economy, economic growth, and urbanization reduce bio-capacity while trade openness increases it. The interactive term of the shadow economy and financial development shows that a strong financial system significantly moderates the adverse impact of shadow economy on environmental degradation. These results persist when common correlated effect mean group is used to re-estimate the models. Furthermore, Dumitrescu and Hurlin's non-causality tests show two-way causality between ecological footprint and shadow economy, bio-capacity and shadow economy, and financial development.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY,The key factors contributing to the persistence of homelessness,"Homelessness is a long-standing social problem in many countries. People who work and volunteer in homeless shelters struggle with the question of how to help homeless people lead an independent life. We sought to answer this question using insights obtained from Google Scholar literature searches and personal experiences with homeless people. In this brief research, we explored the main causes of homelessness in the United States for children, youth, adults, elderly, women, and veterans, over the past decade. The results showed that the three leading causes of homelessness were substance abuse, domestic violence, and mental illness. These problems lead to the initial homelessness, and in turn, homelessness further exacerbates these problems. Preventing and reducing homelessness requires effective policies and community interventions, such as rehabilitation facilities for people with substance abuse, job placement assistance and accommodation for homeless people, and homeless camps in designated areas to serve as bases to help homeless people rebuild their lives.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY,The role of renewable energy consumption and financial development in environmental sustainability: implications for the Nordic Countries,"The Nordic nations have yet to significantly contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 7 and 13. This predicament might be attributed to fundamental financialization concerns in these nations and renewable energy generation implementation issues. The Nordic nations are fighting to reduce CO2 emissions as a result of these two situations. Dealing with this problem may necessitate a policy shift, which represents the focus of this research. Utilizing data from 1980 to 2020, we analyze the heterogeneous impacts of financial development and renewable energy on CO2 emissions using advanced panel and time-series methodologies. The advantage of the wavelet tools (wavelet coherence, partial wavelet and multiple wavelet techniques) is that they help to capture policy initiatives at different frequencies, i.e., short, medium and long-term. Our empirical outcomes from the CS-ARDL show that both financial development and renewable energy decrease CO2 emissions in the short and long term. Furthermore, the outcomes of the wavelet coherence show negative co-movement between CO2 and renewable energy in each Nordic nation except for Iceland with renewable energy driving CO2 in all frequencies. Additionally, financial development enhances the `CO2 emissions-renewable energy consumption' association, but in the short term, it has no stimulating effect. These findings lead to the recommendation of an SDG-oriented policy framework. While this policy agenda is designed to achieve SDGs 7 and 13, it may also be applied to other nations. The study recommends that the Nordic countries implement measures to boost renewable energy supply through enhanced renewable energy technologies.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY,"The role of technology innovation, R\&D, and quality governance in pollution mitigation for EU economies: fresh evidence from method of moment quantile regression","Human progress has become detrimental to the environment. Moreover, the failure to mitigate pollution would eventually impact negatively on the economy. This study investigates the influence of technological innovation, research and development, and quality of governance on carbon emissions for the European Union countries while controlling for industrialization, renewable energy, trade openness and foreign direct investment from 1996 to 2018 by employing the method of moment quantile regression technique. The result revealed that renewable energy, trade openness, and quality governance boost environmental quality, while technological innovation and industrialization increase carbon emissions. Also, the interaction between technological innovation and quality governance, research and development and quality governance as well as industrialization and quality governance decreases carbon emission while that of foreign direct investment and quality governance increases carbon emission. From the causality analysis, there is a bidirectional relationship between research and development and carbon emission, technology innovation and carbon emission, renewable energy and carbon emission, trade openness and carbon emission as well as industrialization and carbon emission. Moreover, a unidirectional connection was obtained between foreign direct investment and carbon emission, as well as quality governance and carbon emission.

ISME JOURNAL,Intracellular common gardens reveal niche differentiation in transposable element community during bacterial adaptive evolution,"The distribution and abundance of transposable elements across the tree of life have significantly shaped the evolution of cellular organisms, but the underlying mechanisms shaping these ecological patterns remain elusive. Here we establish a ``common garden{''} approach to study causal ecological interactions between a xenogeneic conditional lethal sacB gene and the community of transposable insertion sequences (ISs) in a multipartite prokaryote genome. Xenogeneic sacB of low, medium, or high GC content was individually inserted into three replicons of a model bacterium Sinorhizobium fredii, and exhibited replicon- and GC-dependent variation in genetic stability. This variation was largely attributable to multidimensional niche differentiation for IS community members. The transposition efficiency of major active ISs depended on the nucleoid-associated xenogeneic silencer MucR. Experimentally eliminating insertion activity of specific ISs by deleting MucR strongly demonstrated a dominant role of niche differentiation among ISs. This intracellular common garden approach in the experimental evolution context allows not only for evaluating genetic stability of natural and synthetic xenogeneic genes of different sequence signatures in host cells but also for tracking and testing causal relationships in unifying ecological principles in genome ecology.",NA,2023,17,2,10.1038/s41396-022-01344-2,1751-7362,14,127,184,1370,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ISME JOURNAL,"Future climate conditions accelerate wheat straw decomposition alongside altered microbial community composition, assembly patterns, and interaction networks","Although microbial decomposition of plant litter plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil fertility, we know less about likely links of specific microbial traits and decomposition, especially in relation to climate change. We study here wheat straw decomposition under ambient and manipulated conditions simulating a future climate scenario (next 80 years) in agroecosystems, including decay rates, macronutrient dynamics, enzyme activity, and microbial communities. We show that future climate will accelerate straw decay rates only during the early phase of the decomposition process. Additionally, the projected climate change will increase the relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi in decomposing wheat straw. Moreover, the impact of future climate on microbial community assembly and molecular ecological networks of both bacteria and fungi will strongly depend on the decomposition phase. During the early phase of straw decomposition, stochastic processes dominated microbial assembly under ambient climate conditions, whereas deterministic processes highly dominated bacterial and fungal communities under simulated future climate conditions. In the later decomposition phase, similar assembly processes shaped the microbial communities under both climate scenarios. Furthermore, over the early phases of decomposition, simulated future climate enhanced the complexity of microbial interaction networks. We concluded that the impact of future climate on straw decay rate and associated microbial traits like assembly processes and inter-community interactions is restricted to the early phase of decomposition.",NA,2023,17,2,10.1038/s41396-022-01336-2,1751-7362,17,157,220,1630,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ISME JOURNAL,Gastric acid and escape to systemic circulation represent major bottlenecks to host infection by Citrobacter rodentium,"The gastrointestinal (GI) environment plays a critical role in shaping enteric infections. Host environmental factors create bottlenecks, restrictive events that reduce the genetic diversity of invading bacterial populations. However, the identity and impact of bottleneck events on bacterial infection are largely unknown. We used Citrobacter rodentium infection of mice, a model of human pathogenic Escherichia coli infections, to examine bacterial population dynamics and quantify bottlenecks to host colonization. Using Sequence Tag-based Analysis of Microbial Populations (STAMP) we characterized the founding population size (Nb') and relatedness of C. rodentium populations at relevant tissue sites during early- and peak-infection. We demonstrate that the GI environment severely restricts the colonizing population, with an average Nb' of only 12-43 lineages (of 2,000+ inoculated) identified regardless of time or biogeographic location. Passage through gastric acid and escape to the systemic circulation were identified as major bottlenecks during C. rodentium colonization. Manipulating such events by increasing gastric pH dramatically increased intestinal Nb'. Importantly, removal of the stomach acid barrier had downstream consequences on host systemic colonization, morbidity, and mortality. These findings highlight the capability of the host GI environment to limit early pathogen colonization, controlling the population of initial founders with consequences for downstream infection outcomes.",NA,2023,17,1,10.1038/s41396-022-01321-9,1751-7362,16,118,200,1514,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ISME JOURNAL,Single-cell view of deep-sea microbial activity and intracommunity heterogeneity,"Microbial activity in the deep sea is cumulatively important for global elemental cycling yet is difficult to quantify and characterize due to low cell density and slow growth. Here, we investigated microbial activity off the California coast, 50-4000 m water depth, using sensitive single-cell measurements of stable-isotope uptake and nucleic acid sequencing. We observed the highest yet reported proportion of active cells in the bathypelagic (up to 78\%) and calculated that deep-sea cells (200-4000 m) are responsible for up to 34\% of total microbial biomass synthesis in the water column. More cells assimilated nitrogen derived from amino acids than ammonium, and at higher rates. Nitrogen was assimilated preferentially to carbon from amino acids in surface waters, while the reverse was true at depth. We introduce and apply the Gini coefficient, an established equality metric in economics, to quantify intracommunity heterogeneity in microbial anabolic activity. We found that heterogeneity increased with water depth, suggesting a minority of cells contribute disproportionately to total activity in the deep sea. This observation was supported by higher RNA/DNA ratios for low abundance taxa at depth. Intracommunity activity heterogeneity is a fundamental and rarely measured ecosystem parameter and may have implications for community function and resilience.",NA,2023,17,1,10.1038/s41396-022-01324-6,1751-7362,9,80,200,1375,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Here, in situ electrochemical cultivation was conducted using the naturally occurring electromotive forces at a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. The voltage and current generation originating from the resulting microbial activity was observed for 12 days of deployment, with fluctuation in response to tidal cycles. A novel bacterium belonging to the genus Thiomicrorhabdus dominated the microbial community specifically enriched on the cathode. Metagenomic analysis provided the draft genome of the bacterium and the gene repertoire indicated that the bacterium has the potential for thio-autotrophic growth, which is a typical physiological feature of the members of the genus, while the bacterium had a unique gene cluster encoding multi-heme cytochrome c proteins responsible for extracellular electron transfer. Herein, we propose this bacterium as a new species, specifically enriched during electricity generation, as `Candidatus Thiomicrorhabdus electrophagus'.

Known cyanopodoviruses all contain the DNA polymerase gene (DNA pol) that is important for phage DNA replication and widely used in field quantification and diversity studies. However, we isolated 18 cyanopodoviruses without identifiable DNA pol. They form a new MPP-C clade that was separated from the existing MPP-A, MPP-B, and P-RSP2 clades. The MPP-C phages have the smallest genomes (37.3-37.9 kb) among sequenced cyanophages, and show longer latent periods than the MPP-B phages. Metagenomic reads of both clades are highly abundant in surface waters, but the MPP-C phages show higher relative abundance in surface waters than in deeper waters, while MPP-B phages have higher relative abundance in deeper waters.

ISME JOURNAL,Plant-associated Bacillus mobilizes its secondary metabolites upon perception of the siderophore pyochelin produced by a Pseudomonas competitor,"Bacillus velezensis is considered as model species for plant-associated bacilli providing benefits to its host such as protection against phytopathogens. This is mainly due to the potential to secrete a wide range of secondary metabolites with specific and complementary bioactivities. This metabolite arsenal has been quite well defined genetically and chemically but much remains to be explored regarding how it is expressed under natural conditions and notably how it can be modulated upon interspecies interactions in the competitive rhizosphere niche. Here, we show that B. velezensis can mobilize a substantial part of its metabolome upon the perception of Pseudomonas, as a soil-dwelling competitor. This metabolite response reflects a multimodal defensive strategy as it includes polyketides and the bacteriocin amylocyclicin, with broad antibiotic activity, as well as surfactin lipopeptides, contributing to biofilm formation and enhanced motility. Furthermore, we identified the secondary Pseudomonas siderophore pyochelin as an info-chemical, which triggers this response via a mechanism independent of iron stress. We hypothesize that B. velezensis relies on such chelator sensing to accurately identify competitors, illustrating a new facet of siderophore-mediated interactions beyond the concept of competition for iron and siderophore piracy. This phenomenon may thus represent a new component of the microbial conversations driving the behavior of members of the rhizosphere community.",NA,2023,17,2,10.1038/s41396-022-01337-1,1751-7362,17,143,209,1502,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ISME JOURNAL,Dominance of phage particles carrying antibiotic resistance genes in the viromes of retail food sources,"The growth of antibiotic resistance has stimulated interest in understanding the mechanisms by which antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) are mobilized. Among them, studies analyzing the presence of ARGs in the viral fraction of environmental, food and human samples, and reporting bacteriophages as vehicles of ARG transmission, have been the focus of increasing research. However, it has been argued that in these studies the abundance of phages carrying ARGs has been overestimated due to experimental contamination with non-packaged bacterial DNA or other elements such as outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). This study aims to shed light on the extent to which phages, OMVs or contaminating non-packaged DNA contribute as carriers of ARGs in the viromes. The viral fractions of three types of food (chicken, fish, and mussels) were selected as sources of ARG-carrying phage particles, whose ability to infect and propagate in an Escherichia coli host was confirmed after isolation. The ARG-containing fraction was further purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation and, after removal of DNA outside the capsids, ARGs inside the particles were confirmed. The purified fraction was stained with SYBR Gold, which allowed the visualization of phage capsids attached to and infecting E. coli cells. Phages with Myoviridae and Siphoviridae morphology were observed by electron microscopy. The proteins in the purified fraction belonged predominantly to phages (71.8\% in fish, 52.9\% in mussels, 78.7\% in chicken sample 1, and 64.1\% in chicken sample 2), mainly corresponding to tail, capsid, and other structural proteins, whereas membrane proteins, expected to be abundant if OMVs were present, accounted for only 3.8-21.4\% of the protein content. The predominance of phage particles in the viromes supports the reliability of the protocols used in this study and in recent findings on the abundance of ARG-carrying phage particles.",NA,2023,17,2,10.1038/s41396-022-01338-0,1751-7362,15,103,290,1935,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ISME JOURNAL,Unique H-2-utilizing lithotrophy in serpentinite-hosted systems,"Serpentinization of ultramafic rocks provides molecular hydrogen (H-2) that can support lithotrophic metabolism of microorganisms, but also poses extremely challenging conditions, including hyperalkalinity and limited electron acceptor availability. Investigation of two serpentinization-active systems reveals that conventional H-2-/CO2-dependent homoacetogenesis is thermodynamically unfavorable in situ due to picomolar CO2 levels. Through metagenomics and thermodynamics, we discover unique taxa capable of metabolism adapted to the habitat. This included a novel deep-branching phylum, ``Ca. Lithacetigenota{''}, that exclusively inhabits serpentinite-hosted systems and harbors genes encoding alternative modes of H-2-utilizing lithotrophy. Rather than CO2, these putative metabolisms utilize reduced carbon compounds detected in situ presumably serpentinization-derived: formate and glycine. The former employs a partial homoacetogenesis pathway and the latter a distinct pathway mediated by a rare selenoprotein-the glycine reductase. A survey of microbiomes shows that glycine reductases are diverse and nearly ubiquitous in serpentinite-hosted environments. ``Ca. Lithacetigenota{''} glycine reductases represent a basal lineage, suggesting that catabolic glycine reduction is an ancient bacterial innovation by Terrabacteria for gaining energy from geogenic H-2 even under hyperalkaline, CO2-poor conditions. Unique non-CO2-reducing metabolisms presented here shed light on potential strategies that extremophiles may employ for overcoming a crucial obstacle in serpentinization-associated environments, features potentially relevant to primordial lithotrophy in early Earth.",NA,2023,17,1,10.1038/s41396-022-01197-9,1751-7362,6,63,201,1686,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ISME JOURNAL,Light-independent anaerobic microbial oxidation of manganese driven by an electrosyntrophic coculture,"Anaerobic microbial manganese oxidation (AMMO) has been considered an ancient biological metabolism for Mn element cycling on Archaean Earth before the presence of oxygen. A light-dependent AMMO was recently observed under strictly anoxic conditions, providing a new proxy for the interpretation of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. However, the feasibility of biotic Mn(II) oxidation in dark geological habitats that must have been abundant remains unknown. Therefore, we discovered that it would be possible to achieve AMMO in a light-independent electrosyntrophic coculture between Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Geobacter metallireducens. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed insoluble particle formation in the coculture with Mn(II) addition. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis verified that these particles were a mixture of MnO2 and Mn3O4. The absence of Mn oxides in either of the monocultures indicated that the Mn(II)-oxidizing activity was induced via electrosyntrophic interactions. Radical quenching and isotopic experiments demonstrated that hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) produced from H2O dissociation by R. palustris in the coculture contributed to Mn(II) oxidation. All these findings suggest a new, symbiosis-dependent and light-independent AMMO route, with potential importance to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the biogeochemical cycling of manganese on Archaean and modern Earth.",NA,2023,17,1,10.1038/s41396-022-01335-3,1751-7362,11,101,196,1469,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ISME JOURNAL,Chemolithoautotroph distributions across the subsurface of a convergent margin,"Subducting oceanic crusts release fluids rich in biologically relevant compounds into the overriding plate, fueling subsurface chemolithoautotrophic ecosystems. To understand the impact of subsurface geochemistry on microbial communities, we collected fluid and sediments from 14 natural springs across a similar to 200 km transect across the Costa Rican convergent margin and performed shotgun metagenomics. The resulting 404 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) duster into geologically distinct regions based on MAG abundance patterns: outer forearc-only (25\% of total relative abundance), forearc/arc-only (38\% of total relative abundance), and delocalized (37\% of total relative abundance) clusters. In the outer forearc, The rmodesulfovibrionia, Candidatus Bipolaricaulia, and Firmicutes have hydrogenotrophic sulfate reduction and Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) carbon fixation pathways. In the forearc/arc, Anaerolineae, Ca. Bipolaricaulia, and Thermodesulfovibrionia have sulfur oxidation, nitrogen cycling, microaerophilic respiration, and WL, while Aquificae have aerobic sulfur oxidation and reverse tricarboxylic acid carbon fixation pathway. Transformation-based canonical correspondence analysis shows that MAG distribution corresponds to concentrations of aluminum, iron, nickel, dissolved inorganic carbon, and phosphate. While delocalized MAGs appear surface-derived, the subsurface chemolithoautotrophic, metabolic, and taxonomic landscape varies by the availability of minerals/metals and volcanically derived inorganic carbon. However, the WL pathway persists across all samples, suggesting that this versatile, energy-efficient carbon fixation pathway helps shape convergent margin subsurface ecosystems.",NA,2023,17,1,10.1038/s41396-022-01331-7,1751-7362,9,78,206,1717,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ISME JOURNAL,Distribution of fitness effects of cross-species transformation reveals potential for fast adaptive evolution,"Bacterial transformation, a common mechanism of horizontal gene transfer, can speed up adaptive evolution. How its costs and benefits depend on the growth environment is poorly understood. Here, we characterize the distributions of fitness effects (DFE) of transformation in different conditions and test whether they predict in which condition transformation is beneficial. To determine the DFEs, we generate hybrid libraries between the recipient Bacillus subtilis and different donor species and measure the selection coefficient of each hybrid strain. In complex medium, the donor Bacillus vallismortis confers larger fitness effects than the more closely related donor Bacillus spizizenii. For both donors, the DFEs show strong effect beneficial transfers, indicating potential for fast adaptive evolution. While some transfers of B. vallismortis DNA show pleiotropic effects, various transfers are beneficial only under a single growth condition, indicating that the recipient can benefit from a variety of donor genes to adapt to varying growth conditions. We scrutinize the predictive value of the DFEs by laboratory evolution under different growth conditions and show that the DFEs correctly predict the condition at which transformation confers a benefit. We conclude that transformation has a strong potential for speeding up adaptation to varying environments by profiting from a gene pool shared between closely related species.",NA,2023,17,1,10.1038/s41396-022-01325-5,1751-7362,13,109,207,1442,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ISME JOURNAL,Mortality by ribosomal sequencing (MoRS) provides a window into taxon-specific cell lysis,"Microbes are by far the dominant biomass in the world's oceans and drive biogeochemical cycles that are critical to life on Earth. The composition of marine microbial communities is highly dynamic, spatially and temporally, with consequent effects on their functional roles. In part, these changes in composition result from viral lysis, which is taxon-specific and estimated to account for about half of marine microbial mortality. Here, we show that extracellular ribosomal RNA (rRNA(ext)) is produced by viral lysis, and that specific lysed populations can be identified by sequencing rRNA(ext) recovered from seawater samples. In ten seawater samples collected at five depths between the surface and 265 m during and following a phytoplankton bloom, lysis was detected in about 15\% of 16,946 prokaryotic taxa, identified from amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), with lysis occurring in up to 34\% of taxa within a water sample. The ratio of rRNA(ext) to cellular rRNA (rRNA(cell)) was used as an index of taxon-specific lysis, and revealed that higher relative lysis was most commonly associated with copiotrophic bacteria that were in relatively low abundance, such as those in the genera Escherichia and Shigella spp., as well as members of the Bacteriodetes; whereas, relatively low lysis was more common in taxa that are often relatively abundant, such as members of the Pelagibacterales (i.e., SAR11 clade), cyanobacteria in the genus Synechococcus, and members of the phylum Thaumarchaeota (synonym, Nitrososphaerota) that comprised about 13-15\% of the 16 S rRNA gene sequences below 30 m. These results provide an explanation for the long-standing conundrum of why highly productive bacteria that are readily isolated from seawater are often in very low abundance. The ability to estimate taxon-specific cell lysis will help explore the distribution and abundance of microbial populations in nature.",NA,2023,17,1,10.1038/s41396-022-01327-3,1751-7362,12,89,289,1911,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ISME JOURNAL,"Dissecting microbial communities and resistomes for interconnected humans, soil, and livestock","A debate is currently ongoing as to whether intensive livestock farms may constitute reservoirs of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance (AMR), thus posing a threat to surrounding communities. Here, combining shotgun metagenome sequencing, machine learning (ML), and culture-based methods, we focused on a poultry farm and connected slaughterhouse in China, investigating the gut microbiome of livestock, workers and their households, and microbial communities in carcasses and soil. For both the microbiome and resistomes in this study, differences are observed across environments and hosts. However, at a finer scale, several similar clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and similar associated mobile genetic elements were found in both human and broiler chicken samples. Next, we focused on Escherichia coli, an important indicator for the surveillance of AMR on the farm. Strains of E. coli were found intermixed between humans and chickens. We observed that several ARGs present in the chicken faecal resistome showed correlation to resistance/susceptibility profiles of E. coli isolates cultured from the same samples. Finally, by using environmental sensing these ARGs were found to be correlated to variations in environmental temperature and humidity. Our results show the importance of adopting a multi-domain and multi-scale approach when studying microbial communities and AMR in complex, interconnected environments.",NA,2023,17,1,10.1038/s41396-022-01315-7,1751-7362,11,94,204,1458,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ISME JOURNAL,Basin-scale biogeography of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 ecotype replication,"Establishing links between microbial diversity and environmental processes requires resolving the high degree of functional variation among closely related lineages or ecotypes. Here, we implement and validate an improved metagenomic approach that estimates the spatial biogeography and environmental regulation of ecotype-specific replication patterns (R-Obs) across ocean regions. A total of 719 metagenomes were analyzed from meridional Bio-GO-SHIP sections in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean. Accounting for sequencing bias and anchoring replication estimates in genome structure were critical for identifying physiologically relevant biological signals. For example, ecotypes within the dominant marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus exhibited distinct diel cycles in R-Obs that peaked between 19:00-22:00. Additionally, both Prochlorococcus ecotypes and ecotypes within the highly abundant heterotroph Pelagibacter (SAR11) demonstrated systematic biogeographies in R-Obs that differed from spatial patterns in relative abundance. Finally, R-Obs was significantly regulated by nutrient stress and temperature, and explained by differences in the genomic potential for nutrient transport, energy production, cell wall structure, and replication. Our results suggest that our new approach to estimating replication is reflective of gross population growth. Moreover, this work reveals that the interaction between adaptation and environmental change drives systematic variability in replication patterns across ocean basins that is ecotype-specific, adding an activity-based dimension to our understanding of microbial niche space.",NA,2023,17,2,10.1038/s41396-022-01332-6,1751-7362,8,73,207,1631,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ISME JOURNAL,Marine bacteroidetes use a conserved enzymatic cascade to digest diatom beta-mannan,"The polysaccharide beta-mannan, which is common in terrestrial plants but unknown in microalgae, was recently detected during diatom blooms. We identified a beta-mannan polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) in the genome of the marine flavobacterium Muricauda sp. MAR\_2010\_75. Proteomics showed beta-mannan induced translation of 22 proteins encoded within the PUL. Biochemical and structural analyses deduced the enzymatic cascade for beta-mannan utilization. A conserved GH26 beta-mannanase with endo-activity depolymerized the beta-mannan. Consistent with the biochemistry, X-ray crystallography showed the typical TIM-barrel fold of related enzymes found in terrestrial beta-mannan degraders. Structural and biochemical analyses of a second GH26 allowed the prediction of an exo-activity on shorter manno-gluco oligosaccharides. Further analysis demonstrated exo-alpha-1,6-galactosidase- and endo-beta-1,4-glucanase activity of the PUL-encoded GH27 and GH5\_26, respectively, indicating the target substrate is a galactoglucomannan. Epitope deletion assays with mannanases as analytic tools indicate the presence of beta-mannan in the diatoms Coscinodiscus wailesii and Chaetoceros affinis. Mannanases from the PUL were active on diatom beta-mannan and polysaccharide extracts sampled during a microalgal bloom at the North Sea. Together these results demonstrate that marine microorganisms use a conserved enzymatic cascade to degrade beta-mannans of marine and terrestrial origin and that this metabolic pathway plays a role in marine carbon cycling.",NA,2023,17,2,10.1038/s41396-022-01342-4,1751-7362,11,83,201,1559,NA,20,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Our work integrated: effects of temperature on the activation energy (Ea), and evaluation of the rate of decrease or increase through the temperature coefficient (Q10) in the different biological processes of the life table of E. dilatata, including, morphometric values and hatching egg percentages. The best conditions to reach the highest instantaneous growth rate (r) in E. dilatata were 25 degrees C fed with N. oculata (1 x 106 cells/mL) while the lowest r value was registered with C. vulgaris with both temperatures.

Point counts along the shoreline of the lake were employed to identify and record birds. Potential threats to the lake were identified through field observation and via key informant interviews. A total number of 56 bird species belonging to 23 families, and 11 orders were observed. One species, the Blue winged Goose (Cyanochen cyanoptera) was endemic, three species were near-endemic, and five species were vulnerable in their conservation status. A significantly higher number of species (i.e., 47) was recorded in the dry season than in the wet season (i.e., 24). The relative abundance of birds was also significantly higher during the dry season (t = 2.23, P > 0.05). The study also showed that Lake Arekit is under severe threats including urbanization with unwise waste disposals, siltation, and intensive agricultural expansion. Therefore, urgent stakeholder actions are required to save this lake and thereby the vast array of its biodiversity particularly the birds.",bird diversity; conservation challenge; Lake Arekit; species,2022,68,1-Apr,10.1163/22244662-bja10032,1565-9801,10,80,174,1121,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

This aggregate, characterized by dark-colored flowers, is represented by six species in Israel and adjacent Jordan. There is, however, no knowledge of the genetic relationship of these species making verification of their taxonomic status impossible. We investigated genetic variation in this group using analysis of whole chloroplast genomes and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). We also used species distribution modeling (SDM) to predict species ranges under current climatic conditions. We found some population groups within the currently recognized species of section Oncocyclus to represent dramatically different genetic entities which devaluates a general trend of merging many previously recognized species of section Oncocyclus based on their flower morphology. Despite the importance of homoploid hybridization in this group's evolution and some apparently sporadically happening inter-specific gene flow, the main evolutionary forces in Oncocyclus appear to be vicariance and spatial isolation. Our findings suggest that some of the currently recognized species in section Oncocyclus need revision. A revision must be based on genetic analyses allowing the reconstruction of ancestry and recognition of the importance of vicariance and spatial isolation in the evolution of this group.

Ants of this species dig their nests in loess or sandy soils. In Israel, this ants' species is distributed in the Negev Desert and in sandy soils along the Mediterranean Coastal Plain. In this work, 12 sites of natural habitats in the Northern Coastal Plain of Israel were surveyed for surface activity of M. arenarius ants. These ants were found in 3 out of these 12 natural habitats. Two of these sites where M. arenarius ants were found were subjected to disturbance, caused by development works during the period of this survey.

This study was carried out to determine the effect of root pruning on root growth potential and growth of kamagong seedlings. Three-month-old seedlings were obtained from the Learning Laboratory for Forestry and Agroforestry, College of Forestry and Natural Resources, University of the Philippines - Los Banos, where treatments non-root pruned and root pruned were applied to seedlings repotted in larger polybags. After 80 days, root pruning did not significantly affect height and root collar diameter growth. Shoot dry mass, root collar diameter, root length, total tree dry mass, sturdiness quotient, seedling mortality were consistent in between treatments. Non-root pruned seedlings yielded significantly higher root volume and root dry mass while root pruned seedlings have significantly higher shoot height, root: shoot ratio, and seedling quality index. Attainment of moderate Root Growth Potential (RGP) based on root length and root volume was influenced by root pruning.

In this research it was checked, if the selectivity of ants of the species Messor arenarius (Fabricius) to larger food items increases as a function of the distance from their nest entrance to the food site. In food choice experiments, whole wheat seeds and halves of wheat seeds cut longitudinally were offered to M. arenarius ants at the same points. These ants preferred halves of wheat seeds cut longitudinally over whole wheat seeds, in all the distances from nest entrance that were checked in this research - 1m, 5m or 10m from nest entrance. According to these findings, M. arenarius ants did not show increased selectivity to different wheat particles within a distance range of 1m- 10m from their nest entrance. It is possible that since the nutritional value of wheat is relatively high, these ants could not evaluate the nutritional value of wheat particles that were offered to them.",ants; food choice; food preference; Formicidae; increased selectivity; Messor,2021,67,1-Feb,10.1163/22244662-bja10019,1565-9801,16,113,177,1089,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Green product awareness has the potential to promote green consumer behaviour: Evidence from Kuala-Lumpur,"Awareness can influence consumer judgment while making a decision, and thus can help to restore a positive image in the marketplace. The present study was based on 262 green consumer samples, considering awareness as a direct antecedent for green consumer behaviour, and treating the role of attitude as an intermediary construct. Notably, empirical findings for this link are inconsistent. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLSv3.0 was applied to analyze the data, while examining nine hypotheses. Despite discrepancies reported in past studies and although awareness was constantly essential but not sufficient for green behaviour, both green product awareness and green consumer behaviour were empirically significant. The study also confirmed the Attitude-Behaviour-Context (ABC) theory developed to interpret green behaviour on contextual variables, which were all empirically significant. Green attitude mediated the relationship between awareness and green behaviour. But it showed no path to the relationship between green value, green trust and green behaviour when examining indirect effects. This study provides new insights into the potential strategy that could be used to improve positive green behaviour.

A population consists of individuals which have a genotype and a phenotype. The genotype is inherited by descendants and it can mutate. The phenotype is dependent on the genotype. Moreover, the phenotype causes changes in the fitness of the individuals (natural selection which four kinds are defined and analysed). Evolution of the population appears spontaneously. This model is used to analyse how population size influence the rate of evolution. Evolution is manifested by two processes: the increase of the phenotype size (morphological evolution) and number of mutations accumulated on genes (molecular evolution). The rate of evolution increases if population size increases. An adaptive natural selection causes nonlinear changes in the phenotype size and number of mutations accumulated on genes. A competitive natural selection causes linear evolution.

ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Lichens as indicators of atmospheric pollution in urban ecosystems,"Modern methods of lichen indication allow assessing the impact of climate change and air pollution on ecosystem health. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general state of atmospheric air in urban ecosystems of cities and towns using lichen indication methods. The objectives of the study included identifying lichen indicator species, as well as assessing the response of these species to various pollutants (e.g., lead, iron, manganese). The study was conducted in 2017 in the Bryansk region of the Russian Federation (9 settlements in total) and the Oryol region (1 settlement - the city of Oryol). Four hundred samples belonging to epiphytic lichens were collected. Additional 300 and 137 samples of epiphytic lichens were used for chemical and toxicological analyses, respectively. The following two generally accepted lichen indicator indices were calculated: poleotolerance index (PI) and atmospheric purity index (API). When calculating the latter, the lichen species Xanthoria parietina was used as the baseline. Epiphytic lichens in small settlements were represented by 50 species (28 genera, 8 families). In large cities, 55 (Bryansk) and 53 (Oryol) species of epiphytic lichens were detected. The number of species in small settlements was 1.5 times lower than that of large cities. There were 8-15 and 25-32 species of epiphytic lichens in the central region and in the periphery of Bryansk, respectively. The number of epiphytic lichen species detected in the parks was 41. Within the territory of large cities, 17 species of lichens were identified as potential indicators, since they were found in every second or fourth sample. Maximum concentrations of lead were recorded in industrial areas of cities, as well as near major roads with traffic intersection and bridges and in some dormitory suburbs. This is a distinctive feature of large cities - the predominance of lead in lichen thalli, which is primarily associated with vehicles. In small cities in which there are no specific industrial enterprises (metallurgical plants, etc.), other heavy metals - manganese and iron - prevail in the thalli of lichens. In this work, new methods are adopted - mapping pollution with the use of nitrophilous epiphytic lichens that reflect the ongoing macro processes of nitrification in urban areas. The authors have proposed and tested the following lichen indicator methods: the use of indicator species (epiphytes-nitrophytes) of various sensitivities and the study of their distribution within the territory. The mapping method has been substantiated, which takes into account the API and zoning of territories according to the level of general pollution.

ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Little spatial and temporal segregation between coexisting lionfishes (Pterois miles and Pterois radiata) in the Red Sea,"Spatial and temporal niche partitioning are common strategies to reduce competition between closely related species. While spatial partitioning is widely studied, temporal partitioning, especially in marine environments, is much less documented. The lionfish Pterois miles is common in the Red Sea and have recently established populations within the Mediterranean Sea. However, to date, the sympatric and closely related Pterois radiata has yet to become established outside its native range. In this study, we focus on describing spatio-temporal patterns of activity in P miles and P radiata within their native range. This may help understand their coexistence mechanisms and whether the presence of one species can influence the probability of the other species to become established. We used visual surveys across day and night to assess activity patterns and the tendency of the species to co-occur. We found that while P miles is a flexible crepuscular, P. radiata is strictly nocturnal. However, we detected only slight spatio-temporal segregation between the species. Hence, the coexistence of these two species may not be related to habitat or temporal partitioning. However, we do find a more generalist behavior of P miles in terms of activity duration, which adds to its known broad diet and habitat use patterns, and may jointly explain its introduction success.",lionfish; Red Sea; temporal partitioning; spatial partitioning; visual survey,2021,67,1-Feb,10.1163/22244662-bja10005,1565-9801,17,120,210,1376,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

We then quantified the resulting blood cortisol levels and feeding behavior in gerbils. Thirty gerbils were injected with 21-day slow-release cortisol pellets drawn from 5 different dosages. We quantified the physiological response to pellet implantation in gerbils by measuring cortisol level in blood serum using ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay). We fed gerbils daily by mixing millet seeds into the sand inside rodent cages and measured the remaining seeds the following day to quantify feeding efforts. Some evidence supports that subcutaneous supplementation of glucocorticoids (GCs) in the gerbils led to higher blood serum levels. Cortisol levels varied according to time period of measurement.

ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Response of specialized birds to reed-bed aging in a Mediterranean wetland: Significant changes in bird biomass after two decades,"Traditional fish farming carried out in wetland is declining in many countries of Mediterranean Europe. This decline can lead to a lack of management of the reeds that tend to age progressively. In this work we compared, through a wide temporal range (2001-2019), the densities of four habitat-specialized birds (warblers), strictly linked to Phragmites australis reed-beds in a coastal wetland on the Tyrrhenian central Italy. In this wetland, following the abandonment of fish farming, the average density of reeds significantly decreased, and both the average reed diameter and habitat heterogeneity showed a significant increase. Comparing 2001 to 2019, we observed an increase in the total density of breeding warblers. The two species of Acrocephalus (scirpaceus and arundinaceus), and Cettia cetti showed a marked increase in density, while Cisticola juncidis showed a clear decrease. More particularly, a significant increase in Cettia cetti (p < 0.001) and a decrease in Cisticola juncidis (p < 0.05) emerged when comparing bird biomasses. Species diversity and evenness were more high in 2019 than in 2001.

This study tested the hypotheses that slope aspect and organic matter content would influence microbial diversity patterns and distribution. Sets of five soil samples were collected from different slope aspects (north slope, south slopes, and valley bottom) and bacterial and fungal communities were examined using the 16S rRNA gene and ITS1 region sequencing, respectively, on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Organic matter and soil moisture varied significantly across all sites but did not influence microbial diversity patterns. Community structure (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) indicated that each site had a distinct microbial community, and soil moisture along with organic matter modulated the community structure. Relative abundance of key bacterial taxa (Actinobaderia and Baderiodetes) and fungal taxa (Asconlycola was significantly influenced by slope aspect. Our results show, for the first time, that the often reported slope aspect dynamics of the soil microbiomes do in fact influence bacterial and fungal community composition and structure.

In this article, we propose a multicomponent approach involving behaviour, ecology, and physiology to accelerate the study of cultural propensities in the wild. We propose as the first component the use of field experiments that simulate natural contexts, such as foraging behaviours and tool use opportunities, to explore social learning and cultural tendencies in a variety of species. To further accelerate this component, we discuss and advocate for the use of modern machine learning video analysis tools. In conjunction, we examine non-invasive methods to measure ecological influences on foraging such as phenology, fruit availability, dietary intake; and physiological influences such as stress, protein balance, energetics, and metabolism. We feature non-invasive urine sampling to investigate urea, creatinine, ketone bodies, the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3), cortisol and connecting peptides of insulin.

JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,A trait-based framework for dung beetle functional ecology,"Traits are key for understanding the environmental responses and ecological roles of organisms. Trait approaches to functional ecology are well established for plants, whereas consistent frameworks for animal groups are less developed. Here we suggest a framework for the study of the functional ecology of animals from a trait-based response-effect approach, using dung beetles as model system. Dung beetles are a key group of decomposers that are important for many ecosystem processes. The lack of a trait-based framework tailored to this group has limited the use of traits in dung beetle functional ecology. We review which dung beetle traits respond to the environment and affect ecosystem processes, covering the wide range of spatial, temporal and biological scales at which they are involved. Dung beetles show trait-based responses to variation in temperature, water, soil properties, trophic resources, light, vegetation structure, competition, predation and parasitism. Dung beetles' influence on ecosystem processes includes trait-mediated effects on nutrient cycling, bioturbation, plant growth, seed dispersal, other dung-based organisms and parasite transmission, as well as some cases of pollination and predation. We identify 66 dung beetle traits that are either response or effect traits, or both, pertaining to six main categories: morphology, feeding, reproduction, physiology, activity and movement. Several traits pertain to more than one category, in particular dung relocation behaviour during nesting or feeding. We also identify 136 trait-response and 77 trait-effect relationships in dung beetles. No response to environmental stressors nor effect over ecological processes were related with traits of a single category. This highlights the interrelationship between the traits shaping body-plans, the multi-functionality of traits, and their role linking responses to the environment and effects on the ecosystem. Despite current developments in dung beetle functional ecology, many knowledge gaps remain, and there are biases towards certain traits, functions, taxonomic groups and regions. Our framework provides the foundations for the thorough development of trait-based dung beetle ecology. It also serves as an example framework for other taxa.",ecosystem engineers; ecosystem processes; effect traits; multifunctionality; response traits; Scarabaeoidea; trait-function relationships,2023,92,1,10.1111/1365-2656.13829,0021-8790,8,58,323,2280,7,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Animal tracing with sulfur isotopes: Spatial segregation and climate variability in Africa likely contribute to population trends of a migratory songbird,"Climatic conditions affect animals but range-wide impacts at the population level remain largely unknown, especially in migratory species. However, studying climate-population relationships is still challenging in small migrants due to a lack of efficient and cost-effective geographic tracking method. Spatial distribution patterns of environmental stable isotopes (so called `isoscapes') generally overcome these limitations but none of the currently available isoscapes provide a substantial longitudinal gradient in species-rich sub-Saharan Africa. In this region, sulphur (delta S-34) has not been sufficiently explored on a larger scale. We developed a delta S-34 isoscape to trace animal origins in sub-Saharan Africa by coupling known-origin samples from tracked migratory birds with continental remotely sensed environmental data building on environment-delta S-34 relationships using a flexible machine learning technique. Furthermore, we link population-specific nonbreeding grounds with interannual climatic variation that might translate to breeding population trends. The predicted delta S-34 isotopic map featured east-west and coast-to-inland isotopic gradients and was applied to predict nonbreeding grounds of three breeding populations of Eurasian Reed Warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus with two distinct migratory phenotypes. Breeding populations as well as migratory phenotypes exhibited large-scale segregation within the African nonbreeding range. These regions also differed substantially in the interannual climatic variation, with higher interannual variability in the eastern part of the range during 2001-2012. Over the same period, the eastern European breeding population seemed to have experienced a more steep decline in population size. The link between migratory patterns and large-scale climatic variability appears important to better understand population trajectories in many declining migratory animals. We believe animal tracing using sulphur isotopes will facilitate these efforts and offers manifold ecological and forensic applications in the biodiversity hotspot of sub-Saharan Africa.",climate variability; isoscape; migration; migratory divide; remote sensing; sulphur; tracing; tracking,2023,92,7,10.1111/1365-2656.13848,0021-8790,21,153,277,2128,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"Declines in freshwater mussel density, size and productivity in the River Thames over the past half century","A pioneering, quantitative study published in Journal of Animal Ecology in 1966 on freshwater mussel populations in the River Thames, UK, continues to be cited extensively as evidence of the major contribution that mussels make to benthic biomass and ecosystem functioning in global river ecosystems. Ecological alteration, as well as declines in freshwater mussel populations elsewhere, suggest that changes to mussel populations in the River Thames are likely to have occurred over the half century since this study. We resurveyed the site reported in Negus (1966) and quantified the changes in mussel population density, species composition, growth patterns and productivity. We found large declines in population density for all unionid species. The duck mussel Anodonta anatina decreased to 1.1\% of 1964 density. The painter's mussel Unio pictorum fell to 3.2\% of 1964 density. The swollen river mussel Unio tumidus showed statistically nonsignificant declines. In contrast to 1964, in 2020 we found no living specimens of the depressed river mussel Pseudanodonta complanata (classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List) but found new records of the invasive, nonnative zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and Asian clam Corbicula fluminea. Additionally, we found strong decreases in size-at-age for all species, which now grow to 65-90\% of maximum lengths in 1964. As a result of reduced density and size, estimated annual biomass production fell to 7.5\% of 1964 levels. Since mussels can be important to ecosystem functioning, providing key regulating and provisioning services, the declines we found imply substantial degradation of freshwater ecosystem services in the River Thames, one of the UK's largest rivers. Our study also highlights the importance to conservationists and ecologists of updating and validating assumptions and data about wild populations, which in the present era of anthropogenic ecosystem alteration are undergoing significant and rapid changes. Regular population surveys of key species are essential to maintain an accurate picture of ecosystem health and to guide management.",biodiversity loss; biomass; freshwater mussels; growth rate; invasive species; population dynamics; unionids; zebra mussels,2023,92,1,10.1111/1365-2656.13835,0021-8790,17,107,314,2117,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Factors at multiple scales drive parasite community structure,"1.Understanding how ecological communities are assembled remains a key goal of ecosystem ecology. Because communities are hierarchical, factors acting at multiple scales can contribute to patterns of community structure. Parasites provide a natural system to explore this idea, as they exist as discrete communities within host individuals, which are themselves part of a community and metacommunity. 2.We aimed to understand the relative contribution of multi-scale drivers in parasite community assembly and assess how patterns at one level may mask those occurring at another. Specifically, we wanted to disentangle patterns caused by passive sampling from those determined by ecological drivers, and how these vary with scale. 3.We applied a Markov Random Fields model and assessed measures of beta-diversity and nestedness for 420 replicate parasite infracommunities (parasite assemblages in host individuals) across two freshwater mussel host species, three sites and two time periods, comparing our results to simulations from four different ecologically relevant null models. 4.We showed that beta-diversity between sites (explaining 25\% of variation in parasite distribution) and host species (41\%) is greater than expected, and beta-diversity between individual hosts is smaller than expected, even after accounting for parasite prevalence and characteristics of host individuals. Furthermore, parasite communities were significantly less nested than expected once parasite prevalence and host characteristics were both accounted for, but more nested than expected otherwise, suggesting a degree of modularity at the within-host level that is masked if underlying host and parasite characteristics are not taken into account. The Markov Random Fields model provided evidence for possible competitive within-host parasite interactions, providing a mechanism for the observed infracommunity modularity. 5.An integrative approach that examines factors at multiple scales is necessary to understand the composition of ecological communities. Furthermore, patterns at one level can alter the interpretation of ecologically important drivers at another if variation at higher scales is not accounted for.",community assembly; competition; freshwater mussel; infection; Markov Random Fields model; nestedness; null model; turnover; beta-diversity,2023,92,2,10.1111/1365-2656.13853,0021-8790,8,61,305,2210,9,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"Habitat detection, habitat choice copying or mating benefits: What drives conspecific attraction in a nomadic songbird?","Conspecific attraction during habitat selection is common among animals, but the ultimate (i.e. fitness-related) reasons for this behaviour often remain enigmatic. We aimed to evaluate the following three hypotheses for conspecific attraction during the breeding season in male Wood Warblers (Phylloscopus sibilatrix): the habitat detection hypothesis, the habitat choice copying hypothesis and the female preference hypothesis. These hypotheses make different predictions with respect to the relative importance of social and nonsocial information during habitat assessment, and whether benefits accrue as a consequence of aggregation. We tested the above hypotheses using a combination of a 2-year playback experiment, spatial statistics and mate choice models. The habitat detection hypothesis was the most likely explanation for conspecific attraction and aggregation in male Wood Warblers, based on the following results: (1) males were attracted to conspecific song playbacks, but fine-scale habitat heterogeneity was the better predictor of spatial patterns in the density of settling males; (2) male pairing success did not increase, but instead slightly decreased, as connectivity with other males (i.e. the number and proximity of neighbouring males) increased. Our study highlights how consideration of the process by which animals detect and assess habitat, together with the potential fitness consequences of resulting aggregations, are important for understanding conspecific attraction and spatially clustered distributions.",conspecific attraction; decisions; habitat selection; hidden lek; settlement; social information; songbirds; territory clustering,2023,92,1,10.1111/1365-2656.13844,0021-8790,16,119,210,1539,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Inferential power in identifying frequency-dependent social learning strengthened by increasing behavioural options,"Two-option choice experimental designs are the most commonly employed framework for identifying evidence of social learning or social learning strategies in captive and wild populations. In nature, however, animals often choose from more than two behaviours, and multiple innovations may arise simultaneously. Studies of animal social learning are often constrained by small sample sizes, which limit researchers' ability to convincingly identify the proposed social learning strategy responsible for behavioural choice. In this study, I examine whether expanding behavioural options from k = 2 to k > 2 and increasing sample size affects inferential power in identifying social learning strategies. I focus on three frequency-dependent learning strategies: conformist transmission, unbiased transmission and anti-conformist transmission. I simulate 100 datasets for 72 parameter combinations, yielding 7200 simulations. I evaluate number of options (k = 2, 3, 4, 5), population size (n = 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250) and the logarithmic strength of frequency dependence (log(f) = log(1/3), log(1), log(3)). I then fit a Bayesian social learning model to simulated data to evaluate the percent of the posterior consistent with type of frequency dependence, posterior standard deviations, highest posterior density intervals and posterior medians relative to the true simulated value of log(f). I show that increasing the number of options an animal can choose from increases the accuracy and certainty of identifying the type and magnitude of frequency-dependent social learning. These effects are particularly pronounced at small to intermediate sample sizes, which are common in empirical studies of animal social learning. These findings suggest that knowing what an animal did not choose is equally important as knowing what an animal did choose when identifying social learning strategies. By strategically increasing the number of behaviours from which an animal can choose, researchers can increase inferential power in identifying social learning strategies without increasing sample size, that is, adding additional animals or collecting more data.",conformist transmission; conformity; cultural evolution; frequency dependence; multinomial; social learning,2023,92,8,10.1111/1365-2656.13826,0021-8790,12,115,310,2153,6,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,LiDAR reveals a preference for intermediate visibility by a forest-dwelling ungulate species,"1.Visibility (viewshed) plays a significant and diverse role in animals' behaviour and fitness. Understanding how visibility influences animal behaviour requires the measurement of habitat visibility at spatial scales commensurate to individual animal choices. However, measuring habitat visibility at a fine spatial scale over a landscape is a challenge, particularly in highly heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. forests). As a result, our ability to model the influence of fine-scale visibility on animal behaviour has been impeded or limited. 2.In this study, we demonstrate the application of the concept of three-dimensional (3D) cumulative viewshed in the study of animal spatial behaviour at a landscape level. Specifically, we employed a newly described approach that combines terrestrial and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to measure fine-scale habitat visibility (3D cumulative viewshed) on a continuous scale in forested landscapes. We applied the LiDAR-derived visibility to investigate how visibility in forests affects the summer habitat selection and the movement of 20 GPS-collared female red deer Cervus elaphus in a temperate forest in Germany. We used integrated step selection analysis to determine whether red deer show any preference for fine-scale habitat visibility and whether visibility is related to the rate of movement of red deer. 3.We found that red deer selected intermediate habitat visibility. Their preferred level of visibility during the day was substantially lower than that of night and twilight, whereas the preference was not significantly different between night and twilight. In addition, red deer moved faster in high-visibility areas, possibly mainly to avoid predation and anthropogenic risk. Furthermore, red deer moved most rapidly between locations in the twilight. 4.For the first time, the preference for intermediate habitat visibility and the adaption of movement rate to fine-scale visibility by a forest-dwelling ungulate species at a landscape scale was revealed. The LiDAR technique used in this study offers fine-scale habitat visibility at the landscape level in forest ecosystems, which would be of broader interest in the fields of animal ecology and behaviour.",fine-scale visibility; habitat selection; integrated step selection analysis; movement rate; red deer; viewshed,2023,92,7,10.1111/1365-2656.13847,0021-8790,12,92,324,2232,6,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Resistance of termite mounds to variation in long-term fire regimes across semi-arid African savannas,"Fire regimes are expected to change with climate change, resulting in a crucial need to understand the specific ways in which variable fire regimes impact important contributors to ecosystem functioning, such as mound-building termites. Termite mounds and fire are both important agents of savanna ecosystem heterogeneity and functioning, but there is little understanding of how they interact across savanna types. We used very high-resolution LiDAR remote sensing to measure the size and distribution of termite mounds across approximately 1300 ha of experimental burn plots in four South African savanna landscapes representing a wide range of fire treatments differing in seasonality and frequency of burning. In nutrient-poor granitic savannas, fire had no impact on termite mound size, densities and spatial distributions. In nutrient-rich basaltic savannas with high mammalian herbivore abundance and intermediate rainfall, very frequent fires caused a decrease in termite mound size, whereas in arid nutrient-rich basaltic savannas, fires that occurred at intermediate frequencies and in transitional seasons (i.e. late dry season and late wet season) decreased the degree of spatial overdispersal exhibited by mounds. Overall, our results suggest that termite mounds are resistant to variation in fire seasonality and frequency, likely indicating that ecosystem services provided by mound-building termites will be unaffected by changing fire regimes. However, consideration of changes to termite mound size and distribution could be necessary for land managers in specific savanna types, such as nutrient-rich soils with high mammalian herbivore abundance.",drone remote sensing; fire ecology; Kruger National Park; LiDAR; Macrotermes; mound-building termites,2023,92,7,10.1111/1365-2656.13830,0021-8790,14,101,236,1666,6,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Spatial consistency in drivers of population dynamics of a declining migratory bird,"Many migratory species are in decline across their geographical ranges. Single-population studies can provide important insights into drivers at a local scale, but effective conservation requires multi-population perspectives. This is challenging because relevant data are often hard to consolidate, and state-of-the-art analytical tools are typically tailored to specific datasets. We capitalized on a recent data harmonization initiative (SPI-Birds) and linked it to a generalized modelling framework to identify the demographic and environmental drivers of large-scale population decline in migratory pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) breeding across Britain. We implemented a generalized integrated population model (IPM) to estimate age-specific vital rates, including their dependency on environmental conditions, and total and breeding population size of pied flycatchers using long-term (34-64 years) monitoring data from seven locations representative of the British breeding range. We then quantified the relative contributions of different vital rates and population structure to changes in short- and long-term population growth rate using transient life table response experiments (LTREs). Substantial covariation in population sizes across breeding locations suggested that change was the result of large-scale drivers. This was supported by LTRE analyses, which attributed past changes in short-term population growth rates and long-term population trends primarily to variation in annual survival and dispersal dynamics, which largely act during migration and/or nonbreeding season. Contributions of variation in local reproductive parameters were small in comparison, despite sensitivity to local temperature and rainfall within the breeding period. We show that both short- and long-term population changes of British breeding pied flycatchers are likely linked to factors acting during migration and in nonbreeding areas, where future research should be prioritized. We illustrate the potential of multi-population analyses for informing management at (inter)national scales and highlight the importance of data standardization, generalized and accessible analytical tools, and reproducible workflows to achieve them.",annual survival; comparative analysis; environmental effects; full annual cycle; integrated population model; LTRE; multi-population; pied flycatcher,2023,92,1,10.1111/1365-2656.13834,0021-8790,12,83,296,2240,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Temporal analysis of GBIF data reveals the restructuring of communities following climate change,"Multiple studies revealed an effect of climate change on biodiversity by investigating long-term changes in species distributions and community composition. However, many taxa do not benefit from systematic long-term monitoring programmes, leaving gaps in our current knowledge of climate-induced community turnover. We used data extracted from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to characterize community reorganization under climate change for nine animal taxonomic groups (ants, bats, bees, birds, butterflies, earthworms, frogs, rodents and salamanders), which, for most of them, had never been studied before in this regard. Using a presence-only community temperature index (CTI), reflecting the relative proportion of warm- and cold-adapted species, we tested whether and how species' assemblages were affected by climate change over the last 30 years. Across Europe and North America, we observed an average increase in CTI, consistent with a gradual species turnover driven by climate change. At the local scale, we could observe that the composition of most species assemblages changed according to temperature variations. However, this change in composition always occurred with a lag compared to climate change, suggesting that communities are experiencing a climatic debt. Results suggest that anthropization may play a role in the decoupling between the change in CTI and the change in local temperature. The results of our study highlight an overall thermophilization of assemblages as a response of temperature warming. We demonstrated that this response may exist for a large range of understudied terrestrial animals, and we introduced a framework that can be used in a broader context, opening new opportunities for global change research.",animal; citizen science; climate change; climatic debt; community ecology; GBIF,2023,92,2,10.1111/1365-2656.13854,0021-8790,13,96,256,1768,6,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Ungulate spatiotemporal responses to contrasting predation risk from wolves and snow leopards,"Spatial responses to risk from multiple predators can precipitate emergent consequences for prey (i.e. multiple-predator effects, MPEs) and mediate indirect interactions between predators. How prey navigate risk from multiple predators may therefore have important ramifications for understanding the propagation of predation-risk effects (PREs) through ecosystems. The interaction of predator and prey traits has emerged as a potentially key driver of antipredator behaviour but remains underexplored in large vertebrate systems, particularly where sympatric prey share multiple predators. We sought to better generalize our understanding of how predators influence their ecosystems by considering how multiple sources of contingency drive prey distribution in a multi-predator-multi-prey system. Specifically, we explored how two sympatric ungulates with different escape tactics-vertically agile, scrambling ibex Capra sibirica and sprinting argali Ovis ammon-responded to predation risk from shared predators with contrasting hunting modes-cursorial wolves Canis lupus and vertical-ambushing, stalking snow leopards Panthera uncia. Contrasting risk posed by the two predators presented prey with clear trade-offs. Ibex selected for greater exposure to chronic long-term risk from snow leopards, and argali for wolves, in a nearly symmetrical manner that was predictable based on the compatibility of their respective traits. Yet, acute short-term risk from the same predator upended these long-term strategies, increasing each ungulates' exposure to risk from the alternate predator in a manner consistent with a scenario in which conflicting antipredator behaviours precipitate risk-enhancing MPEs and mediate predator facilitation. By contrast, reactive responses to wolves led ibex to reduce their exposure to risk from both predators-a risk-reducing MPE. Evidence of a similar reactive risk-reducing effect for argali vis-a-vis snow leopards was lacking. Our results suggest that prey spatial responses and any resulting MPEs and prey-mediated interactions between predators are contingent on the interplay of hunting mode and escape tactics. Further investigation of interactions among various drivers of contingency in PREs will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding and improved forecasting of the ecological effects of predators.",landscape of fear; multiple-predator effects; non-consumptive effects; predation-risk effects; predator facilitation; risk allocation; snow leopard; wolf,2023,92,1,10.1111/1365-2656.13850,0021-8790,12,93,316,2352,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Amphibian loss alters periphyton structure and invertebrate growth in montane streams,"Amphibians are declining worldwide due to a combination of stressors such as climate change, invasive species, habitat loss, pollution and emergent diseases. Although their losses are likely to have important ecological consequences on the structure and functioning of freshwater ecosystems, this issue has been scarcely explored. We conducted an experiment in three montane streams-where primary production is the main source of energy and carbon-to assess the effects of amphibian disappearance (i.e. presence or absence of the common midwife toad Alytes obstetricans, a common species found in pools of these streams) on several aspects of ecosystem functioning and structure: periphyton biomass and chlorophyll a concentration, algal assemblage structure, and growth of macroinvertebrate grazers. We compared four types of experimental enclosures: (i) without macroinvertebrates or amphibians; (ii) with larvae of the caddisfly Allogamus laureatus; (iii) with A. obstetricans tadpoles; and (iv) with both A. laureatus larvae and A. obstetricans tadpoles. The absence of tadpoles increased periphyton biomass, but did not cause differences on inorganic sediment accrual. The algal assemblage had a higher diversity in the absence of tadpoles, and their characteristic taxa differed from the assemblages in presence of tadpoles. A. laureatus presented higher mass in presence of tadpoles; however, tadpole length was not affected by presence of macroinvertebrates. Our results suggest that presence of tadpoles is a driver of periphyton accrual and assemblage structure, acting as top-down control and with key potential consequences on the functioning of montane stream ecosystems.",algae; Allogamus laureatus; Alytes obstetricans; chlorophyll; tadpoles,2022,91,11,10.1111/1365-2656.13818,0021-8790,11,85,239,1684,5,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Camouflage in lichen moths: Field predation experiments and avian vision modelling demonstrate the importance of wing pattern elements and background for survival,"Background matching is perhaps the most ubiquitous form of defensive camouflage in the animal kingdom, an adaptive strategy that relies on the visual resemblance between a prey organism and its background to promote concealment from predators. The importance of background matching has been acknowledged for over a century, yet despite its renown and apparent pervasiveness, few studies exist that have objectively quantified its occurrence and tested the functional significance of background matching in a specific animal study system. The North Island lichen moth Declana atronivea presents a fascinating system to investigate such anti-predator coloration. This species possesses high contrast black and white forewings that appear to resemble lichen. Here we assessed the contribution of background matching to the antipredator defence of D. atronivea using field predation experiments with realistic models. We found that D. atronivea coloration confers a significant survival advantage against native avian predators when on lichen backgrounds compared to bark backgrounds, with an intermediate level of predation occurring when models were near, but not on lichen. This suggests that D. atronivea wing patterns are an adaptation for background matching. We subsequently used calibrated digital photography, avian vision modelling and image analysis techniques to objectively quantify the degree of background matching exhibited by D. atronivea and assessed the contribution of different visual elements (colour, luminance and pattern) to camouflage in this species. Only the pattern elements of D. atronivea presented a close match to that of the lichen backgrounds, with both chromatic and achromatic cues found to be poor predictors of background matching in this species. This study is one of the first to integrate vision modelling, quantitative image analysis and field predation experiments using realistic models to objectively quantify the level and functional significance of background matching in a real species, and presents an ideal system for further investigating the interrelation between multiple mechanisms of camouflage.",artificial models; background matching; camouflage; colour analysis; crypsis; lichen resemblance; moth,2022,91,12,10.1111/1365-2656.13817,0021-8790,22,162,308,2147,7,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,Connectivity among thermal habitats buffers the effects of warm climate on life-history traits and population dynamics,"Contemporary climate change affects population dynamics, but its influence varies with landscape structure. It is still unclear whether landscape fragmentation buffers or amplifies the effects of climate on population size and the age and body size of individuals composing these populations. This study aims to investigate the impacts of warm climates on lizard life-history traits and population dynamics in habitats that vary in their connectivity. We monitored common lizard Zootoca vivipara populations for 3 years in an experimental system in which both climatic conditions and connectivity among habitats were simultaneously manipulated. We considered two climatic treatments (i.e. present-day climate and warm climate {[}+1.4 degrees C than present-day climate]) and two connectivity treatments (i.e. a connected treatment in which individuals could move from one climate to the other and an isolated treatment in which movement between climates was not possible). We monitored survival, reproduction, growth, dispersal, age and body size of each individual in the system as well as population density through time. We found that the influence of warm climates on life-history traits and population dynamics depended on connectivity among thermal habitats. Populations in warm climates were (i) composed of younger individuals only when isolated; (ii) larger in population size only in connected habitats and (iii) composed of larger age-specific individuals independently of the landscape configuration. The connectivity among habitats altered population responses to climate warming likely through asymmetries in the flow and phenotype of dispersers between thermal habitats. Our results demonstrate that landscape fragmentation can drastically change the dynamics and persistence of populations facing climate change.",climate change; dispersal; experiments; habitat fragmentation; lizard,2022,91,11,10.1111/1365-2656.13814,0021-8790,16,118,257,1828,5,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Accounting for environmental stress in restoration of intertidal foundation species,"1. Restoration of foundation species in historical habitat may be difficult if adult facilitation is obligatory for survival of early life stages. 2. On intertidal Mediterranean coasts, large-scale loss of the dominant forest-forming macroalga Ericaria amentacea have prompted restoration efforts using recruits. Yet, early life stages may be more susceptible to the abiotic stress that characterizes their habitat. 3. We tested strategies to enhance resilience of lab-cultured juveniles of E. amentacea to environmental stress in historical habitat lacking conspecifics. Juveniles were exposed in culture to fluctuations of the dominant physical stressors, irradiance and temperature, and then outplanted in upper and lower zones of their native intertidal range. 4. Without adult canopy, juvenile outplant survival was limited to the lower tidal range, with nearly complete mortality in the upper zone. Survival was also strongly determined by spatial clumping of recruits within the outplant substrate. Longer-term growth in the lower zone was enhanced by fluctuating mild stress in culture, with variable irradiance and concurrent heat pulses increasing post-outplant cover by 40\%-60\% after 4 months. Clumping also promoted growth across experimental treatments. 5. Synthesis and applications. Reliance on self-facilitation feedbacks is a common barrier to foundation species restoration in high-stress habitats. Our results suggest that without adult habitat amelioration, environmental stress limits recruit survival in intertidal algal forest. Yet, exposure to transient, low environmental stress in culture and outplanting of clumped individuals may confer resilience and allow successful establishment of early life stages in zones of reduced abiotic stress, providing a source for gradual colonization of more high-stress areas.",environmental stress; foundation species; intertidal; macroalgae; marine forest; resilience; restoration; self-facilitation,2023,60,2,10.1111/1365-2664.14334,0021-8901,10,83,256,1840,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Artificial light at night affects plant-herbivore interactions,"Artificial light at night (ALAN) affects species' physiology and behaviour, and the interactions between species. Despite the importance of plants as primary producers, it remains poorly understood whether and how effects of ALAN on plants cascade through the food web. We assess the extent to which ALAN of different spectra result in plant-mediated insect herbivory damage. In a 6-month field experiment, we exposed plants of differing palatability to three colours of ALAN and a dark control, and assessed plant traits (growth rate, leaf size, foliar density and thickness) and insect herbivory (represented by insect damage as loss of foliage to leaf-chewing insects, and gall abundance by phloem-feeding herbivory). We found evidence for plant trait-mediated ALAN effects on herbivory for oak, but not for blueberry. In oak, ALAN of different colours changed the direction of relationships of insect damage with relative growth rate and with leaf thickness. Moreover, we found that the effects of ALAN on herbivory damage differed markedly between forest types within the same locale, particularly in the red light treatment. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide evidence that continuous night-time light, as provided by street lighting around the world, affects food web interactions. The nature of these effects differed by species and appeared to depend on forest type and the light spectrum employed, thus underlining the context dependency of ALAN in different ecosystems and environmental settings. These findings highlight the complexity of using spectral manipulation as a mitigation measure, and the need for further consideration of ALAN in environmental management and planning, to limit the exposure and impact of cascading effects of artificial light at night on food webs and communities.",artificial light at night; cascading effects; context dependency; food web; herbivory,2023,60,3,10.1111/1365-2664.14336,0021-8901,7,62,273,1818,5,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Barriers to seedling establishment in grasslands: Implications for Nothofagus forest restoration and migration,"Tree seedling establishment outside forest boundaries is controlled by many interacting factors. Understanding the relative importance of different pressures is essential for improving techniques for forest restoration and for understanding the potential of forest boundaries to shift and adapt to changing climate conditions. We investigated constraints on the spread of a key southern hemisphere forest type into grasslands by undertaking a multifactorial experiment sowing Nothofagus cliffortioides (Nothofagaceae) in a historically deforested retired pasture. We manipulated factors to determine the relative effects of sheltered microsites, competition with pasture species, availability of ectomycorrhizal fungi, soil nutrients and rabbit herbivory, on seedling emergence and survival. Overall survival was low (11.7\% after 6 months and 1.5\% after 10 months), but there were strong treatment effects on both seedling establishment and survival. The availability of shelter and competition with pasture species had strongest effects, with the presence of pasture species initially aiding seedling emergence due to a sheltering effect, but negatively affecting survival at later stages. Most remaining seedlings at the conclusion of the experiment had formed ectomycorrhizae regardless of whether inoculum was supplied, and seedling survival and health was positively related to ectomycorrhizal colonization. Fertilizing had less of an effect than other factors, and results regarding rabbit herbivory were inconclusive. Synthesis and applications. This study provides new insights into how factors interact to limit tree seedling establishment in grasslands and forest expansion into neighbouring ecosystems. This improves understanding of the ability of an ectomycorrhizal keystone forest species to migrate and adapt to climate change. This study also assists restoration practitioners in selecting techniques that will enhance seedling establishment, and highlights that direct seeding approaches in open grasslands are unlikely to result in high rates of Nothofagus establishment.",ectomycorrhizal fungi; forest migration; Fuscospora; grass competition; reforestation; restoration; southern beech,2023,60,2,10.1111/1365-2664.14331,0021-8901,13,110,283,2091,7,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Compensatory recruitment unlikely in high-elevation amphibian populations challenged with disease,"Understanding the causes of population variation in host response to disease, and the mechanisms of persistence, can serve as vital information for species conservation. One such mechanism of population persistence that has gained support is the demographic process of compensatory recruitment. Host populations may persist by increasing recruitment to compensate for reduced survival due to infection, thus limiting the negative effects of the disease on population trajectories. However, high-elevation populations are inherently vulnerable to stochastic processes and may be limited in their ability to exhibit compensatory recruitment relative to lower elevation populations. We use long-term mark-recapture data from five populations of boreal toads Anaxyrus boreas boreas, across an elevational gradient in Colorado, before and after pathogen arrival to assess whether populations can persist with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) via compensatory recruitment. Prior to pathogen arrival, we found a life-history trade-off between survival and recruitment across elevations, where high-elevation toads have high survival but lower recruitment and vice versa at lower elevations. Pathogen arrival had a strong negative effect on apparent annual survival and recruitment leading to negative population growth rates and dramatically reduced host abundances. The data did not support the occurrence of compensatory recruitment. Synthesis and applications. Our unique dataset indicates that demographic responses to pathogens may be environmentally (i.e. elevationally) context dependent and highlights the value of long-term monitoring. We recommend that practitioners verify that potential persistence mechanisms occur across multiple populations and relevant environmental gradients to counter any assumptions of the mechanism existing species-wide. Quantifying variation in population responses to disease will aid in understanding the bounds of such persistence mechanisms and identify particularly vulnerable populations where mechanisms are nonexistent.",amphibian declines; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; boreal toad; compensatory recruitment; disease; elevational gradient; persistence; populations,2023,60,1,10.1111/1365-2664.14310,0021-8901,10,97,272,2063,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Contrasting soil- and canopy-nurse effects in metalliferous systems may be explained by dominant plant functional strategies,"Plant-plant interaction studies in metalliferous systems have focused either on the role of facilitation or on negative effects of elemental allelopathy. However, no studies have investigated both of these effects in the same system, and their relationships with the functional strategy of the nurse species, although this is crucial for the ecological restoration of polluted sites. We assessed the effects of two dominant nurse species, with apparent contrasting strategies, on two target species on a slag heap in the Pyrenees (France). We quantified both long-term soil-engineering and short-term canopy effects on the growth of two target species. We also measured morphological traits and leaf metal concentration of the two nurse species and their effects on air moisture, temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Nurse functional strategies, as inferred from morphological traits and leaf metal concentration seem to drive their long-term soil engineering effects on target species: Gypsophila repens, the relative larger and more exploitative species with high leaf metal concentration, had negative long-term effects likely due to elemental allelopathy, whereas Minuartia verna, the relative smaller and more conservative species with lower amount of metals in leaves, had neutral long-term effects. Although Gypsophila repens had a slightly stronger positive effect on microclimate than Minuartia verna, this did not turn into higher short-term effects for the target species. Synthesis and applications: Our study highlights the diverse long and short-term nurse effects on companion species in metalliferous systems. Different nurse species can improve the performance of companion species by mitigation of climatic stress, and ultimately help speed-up the restoration of polluted environments. However, species status regarding leaf metal accumulation has to be verified. For species having a higher metal concentration in their leaves, positive microclimatic effects may be offset by local increase of soil contamination on the long-term.",elemental alellopathy; functional strategies; leaf economic spectrum; metal hyperaccumulation; micro-climate amelioration; soil engineering; stress gradient hypothesis; ecological restoration,2023,60,2,10.1111/1365-2664.14329,0021-8901,16,124,294,2053,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Different ways to success: Plant community trajectories over time and a soil moisture gradient in restored wetlands,"Ecological restoration is one of the most promising strategies to combat historical wetland losses caused by land use changes. Restored areas are ideal sites to study plant succession and changes in ecosystem functions over time. However, little is known about the influence of restoration on plant succession along environmental stress gradients. Knowing the processes and mechanisms driving the succession over time in contrasting abiotic conditions might provide new insight into the ultimate success of an ecological restoration. Relying on long-term vegetation monitoring, we studied the community succession of 4 plant communities along a restored waterlogging gradient in North-East Italy (from high to low soil saturation level): (i) Cladium fens, (ii) low alkaline fens, (iii) Molina wet meadows and (iv) dry meadows. We monitored 23 permanent plots distributed along the gradient, spanning from 1 to 21 years since restoration, and 4 plots as target vegetation (natural habitats). We analysed the changes in plant communities in terms of functional traits, diversity and species composition. We found that exotic and annual species decreased in mature stages of restoration while leaf dry matter content increased over time. Nutrient indicator value and leaf area showed opposite trends at the extreme points of the gradient. Across the successional stages, species richness decreased in Cladium fens and increased in alkaline fens and meadows. Species composition moved toward target vegetation showing contrasting dynamics between different restored habitats. Synthesis and applications. During succession waterlogging stress acts as main abiotic filter, triggering contrasting trajectories of plant communities. This filter seems to be stronger at the extreme points of the gradient generating opposite but faster dynamics than at intermediate conditions. Time and waterlogging promoted a continuous selection of species consistent to target vegetation in terms of richness, functional traits and composition. The evidenced trajectories suggest the need to develop habitat-specific protocols concerning the selection of restoration site and subsequent management decisions, with particular regard to plant communities at intermediate ecological conditions.",alien species; chronosequence; ecological restoration; fens; flooding; functional traits; plant diversity; plant succession,2023,60,1,10.1111/1365-2664.14308,0021-8901,17,115,320,2269,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Direct and indirect effects of management and landscape on biological pest control and crop pest infestation in apple orchards,"Biological pest control, relying on naturally occurring predator-prey dynamics, is considered a key element to achieve more sustainable farming systems. However, the combined effects of local management and landscape factors on communities of natural enemies as well as the cascading effects on pest infestations are rarely addressed, especially in perennial crops. Here, we used Piecewise Structural Equation Modelling (PSEM) to test direct and indirect effects of landscape composition, landscape configuration and local management practices on natural enemy communities, the pest control services they provide and ultimately on pest infestation and pest-related yield damage in apple crops. To this end, we surveyed 12 organic and 12 Integrated Pest Management (IPM) orchards during three consecutive years, and we also established a semi-natural benchmark to quantify the extent to which predator communities in the orchards were degraded. Natural enemies had a different community composition and were more abundant in organic orchards compared with IPM orchards. This had a small and positive effect on sentinel egg predation rates in organic orchards, but overall had very little impact on actual apple pest infestation. On the contrary, apple pest infestation levels were directly and positively affected by organic management practices and by increasing semi-natural habitat cover and landscape edge density. Compared with a semi-natural benchmark, both agricultural management systems showed degraded predator communities, which translated into an impaired delivery of biological control services. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that organic management and habitat conservation can enhance natural enemies and stimulate pest control, but also show that these factors can enhance pest infestations and can even lead to an overall increase in pest-related crop damage. Our study thus highlights the complex interplay of ecosystem services and disservices provided by biodiversity, which should be taken into account when advising farmers, policy makers and land managers on effective and sustainable strategies to control pest species and safeguard crop production.",apple cultivation; biological control; integrated pest management; landscape context; organic management; semi-natural benchmark; structural equation modelling,2023,60,1,10.1111/1365-2664.14319,0021-8901,19,126,311,2191,7,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Disease management during bloom affects the floral microbiome but not pollination in a mass-flowering crop,"1. Flowering crops are heavily managed during bloom to both promote pollination and prevent disease. Disease management practices can alter the floral microbiome, including pathogens and nontarget microbes. However, whether agrochemical presence or altered microbiome composition affect pollinator foraging and pollination services is unclear. 2. We assessed effects of orchard management tactics and landscape context on the flower microbiome in almond, Prunus dulcis. Fourteen orchards (five conventional, four organic and five conventional with habitat augmentation) were sampled at early and peak bloom to characterize bacterial and fungal communities associated with floral tissues. The surveys were complemented by an artificial flower experiment to assess effects of fungicides and microbes on honey bee foraging. Finally, a field trial was conducted to test effects of fungicides and microbes on pollination. 3. As bloom progressed, bacterial and fungal abundance and diversity increased across all floral tissue types and management strategies. The magnitude by which microbial abundance and diversity were affected varied, with proximity to apiaries and orchard management having notable effects on bacteria and fungi respectively. 4. Experiments revealed that fungicides reduced nectar removal by honey bees; however, neither fungicide nor microbe treatments affected pollination, as measured through pollen tube initiation and growth. 5.Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that microbiota associated with flowers of a pollinator-dependent crop are temporally dynamic and sensitive to management practices. However, pollination services in almond may be resilient to both agrochemical disturbance and microbial augmentation of flowers, the latter of which may become more prominent as microbial solutions to disease management are embraced in agroecosystems.",agricultural landscapes; ecosystem services; flower microbiome; fungicide; pollination; Prunus dulcis; sustainable agriculture,2023,60,1,10.1111/1365-2664.14320,0021-8901,15,106,257,1880,7,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Farmstead modernization adversely affects farmland birds,"Farmland biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate and various conservation measures have been implemented to reverse this negative trend. Farmsteads within agricultural landscapes were recently identified as farmland bird hotspots, so we ask whether the modernization of farmsteads has substantially reduced their conservation potential for farmland birds. We assessed the effect of farmstead modernization on 29 farmland bird species in rural landscapes on 97 dairy farms across the Czech Republic, investigating differences in farmland bird abundance and species richness, as well as nest abundance of declining farmland species breeding in buildings, by comparing new/modernized with old and mixed farmsteads. Additionally, we investigated how farmstead size and environmental variables influenced avian assemblages on farmsteads. Farmland bird abundance was almost 3-fold lower in new/modernized farmsteads compared to mixed and old farmsteads (this difference was mostly driven by building-nesters and noncrop-nesters). Similarly, species richness was higher in old and mixed farmsteads compared to new farmsteads. Old cow sheds hosted more nests (both old and new nests; by a factor of 1.6-21) of house sparrows Passer domesticus, barn swallows Hirundo rustica and house martins Delichon urbicum compared to new cow sheds. Importantly, effects of environmental variables were negligible or smaller compared to the farmstead type, suggesting that bird abundance and species richness on farmsteads was primarily driven by farmstead modernization rather than the structure of surrounding farmland. Synthesis and applications. Farmstead modernization may have strong adverse effects on farmland bird populations due to reducing the availability of critical high-quality nesting and foraging opportunities. Modernization is largely financed from existing EU funds, which directly conflicts with EU biodiversity strategies aiming at halting biodiversity loss. We therefore recommend (i) including compensatory measures to increase nesting and foraging opportunities for birds during farmstead construction/modernization, (ii) increasing awareness of these problems among critical stakeholders and (iii) increasing support to small-sized traditional farms to retain and improve habitat conditions for declining farmland species.",biodiversity conservation; farmland bird hotspots; farms; housing renovation; non-farmland habitats; rural areas; sustainable development,2023,60,1,10.1111/1365-2664.14314,0021-8901,6,56,315,2332,7,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Increasing crop richness and reducing field sizes provide higher yields to pollinator-dependent crops,"Agricultural landscapes cover >60\% of terrestrial landscapes. While biodiversity conservation and crop productivity have been seen as mutually exclusive options for a long time, recent research suggests that agricultural landscapes represent significant opportunities for biodiversity conservation outside of traditional protected areas. Here, we use a unique dataset that includes annual monitoring of 12,300 permanent 25-ha plots over two decades across Spain to assess how agricultural landscapes are changing over time. We focus particularly on landscape composition and configuration variables such as the diversity of crops grown within a landscape, average plot size or the cover of natural habitats and assess how changes to these variables affect the ability of agricultural landscapes to ensure high yields. We find potential synergistic strategies that are good for biodiversity conservation and can also lead to increasing crop yields. Specifically, we find that management practices that favour increasing biodiversity values such as maintaining small field sizes and high crop richness values at the landscape scale actually led to the greatest average yield values across 54 crops, 41\% of which depend on pollinator activity for reproduction. Policy implications: While our analysis does not factor in economic costs and benefits, we show that synergy scenarios that are good for biodiversity conservation and crop productivity are possible, yet not as widespread as they could be.",agricultural intensification; agricultural landscape; crop yield; pollination service; yield gaps,2023,60,1,10.1111/1365-2664.14305,0021-8901,13,101,217,1498,5,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Managing risk of non-indigenous species establishment associated with ballast water discharges from ships with bypassed or inoperable ballast water management systems,"Ballast water is recognized as a leading pathway for the introduction of aquatic non-indigenous species which have caused substantial ecological damage globally. Following international regulations, most international ships will install a ballast water management system (BWMS) by 2024 to limit the concentration of aquatic organisms in ballast water discharges; however, these new technologies may not operate as expected at global ports having variable water quality or may periodically malfunction. Using simulations informed by empirical data, we investigated the risk of non-indigenous species establishment associated with BWMS inoperability and evaluated potential mitigation strategies. Scenarios considered included bypassed or inoperable BWMS achieving no reduction in organisms, and partially functioning BWMS with discharged organism concentrations exceeding permissible limits. These scenarios were contrasted to outcomes with fully functioning BWMS and to voyages where ballast water exchange (BWE) was used to mitigate risk. Partially functioning BWMSs were nonetheless beneficial, reducing organism concentrations in ballast and thus establishment risk. When a BWMS is bypassed or partially functioning, BWE is a useful emergency mitigation measure, reducing establishment risks more than partial BMWS. However, the greatest risk reduction was achieved when partial BWMS and BWE were combined. Voyage-specific characteristics such as concentration of organisms at uptake and destination port salinity can affect the optimal management strategy for voyages when the BWMS does not achieve compliant discharges. Synthesis and applications. The risk of aquatic invasions and their associated ecological damages can be substantially reduced by using a ballast water management system (BWMS) and/or ballast water exchange (BWE). When a BWMS is inoperable, appropriate mitigation measures should be decided on a trip-by-trip basis considering voyage route and reason for BWMS inoperability (when known). BWE is a useful strategy for reducing invasion risk, except when uptake concentrations are very low. Combining BWE and partial BWMS always reduced risk compared with BWE alone, but did not greatly reduce risk when uptake concentrations were high.",ballast water; D-2 standard; establishment risk; invasive; non-native; plankton; propagule pressure; shipping,2023,60,1,10.1111/1365-2664.14321,0021-8901,21,166,312,2259,8,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,Pinpointing stage-specific causes of recruitment bottlenecks to optimize seed-based wetland restoration,"Attaining the goals of `The UN-Decade on Ecosystem Restoration' requires efficient methods for large-scale restoration of degraded ecosystems. Seed-based approaches may offer opportunities for massive recovery of native vegetation but are prone to failure when applied to highly valued coastal wetlands such as salt marshes. Pinpointing the impact of early life stage transitions on recruitment variation across species and contexts is a critical first step toward amplifying seed-based restoration efficiency. Large-scale field experiments were conducted in 100 microhabitats across eight salt marshes to investigate root causes of variation in seed retention and seedling emergence, using four globally occurring salt marsh species as models. The resulting insights and dataset were then translated into predictors using machine learning, for targeted application in disentangling recruitment bottlenecks. Seed retention, regardless of species, was identified as the principal bottleneck in recruitment with hydrodynamic intensity, bed-level dynamics, and burial depth as critical governing factors. Seedling emergence was discerned as the critical bottleneck driving cross-species recruitment variability and was pivotally influenced by soil salinity and burial depth. Predictions using machine learning under different restoration scenarios indicated that simple management, such as seed burial or species selection, can create opportunities to bypass potential recruitment bottlenecks. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the failure of seed-based coastal wetland restoration should be attributed to multiple recruitment bottlenecks that arise from different life stage transitions and are context/species dependent. In planning future seed-based restoration practices, managers should assess the variability of life stage-specific dominant factors at target sites to identify site-specific recruitment bottleneck(s). Our work underscores the need for strategic management that buffers against recruitment bottlenecks to improve restoration efficiency and advances the application of data-driven techniques to make seed-based restoration predictive.",machine learning; recruitment bottleneck; salt marshes; seed retention; seed-based restoration; seedling emergence; wetlands,2023,60,2,10.1111/1365-2664.14325,0021-8901,11,103,282,2171,7,NA,350,8,Other structure requirements,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,Genetic patterns of Magnolia in the Lesser Antilles: Stepwise colonisation leading to highly inbred island `populations',"Aim Islands are `nature's laboratories of evolution'.

Here, we challenge island biogeographical patterns using a slowly evolving recent colonist present on five islands in a nonlinear chronosequence island chain. Location The Lesser Antilles (Caribbean). Taxon Magnolia dodecapetala (Magnoliaceae). Methods Genetic diversity was characterised using Sanger sequencing of 21 individuals amplified for 11 DNA markers, plus microsatellite data of 195 individuals genotyped with 19 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Sanger sequencing data were used to construct a Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis, while SSR markers were used to run approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) demographic analyses and calculate population statistics. Results Both types of molecular data support stepwise colonisation, decoupled from known island ages. The ABC analyses support a north to south migration while the Sanger sequencing data indicate a mixture of island progression rule and stepping stone dispersal. The SSR data show strong genetic structuring per island and significant inbreeding in all populations except in Saint Lucia. The lowest genetic diversity is found in the population from Saint Vincent. A high amount of genetic linkage occurs in a subpopulation from Dominica. Main Conclusions Biogeographical patterns in the complex geological setting of the Lesser Antilles are uncovered using a slowly evolving study species.

JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,Global biogeography of ant social parasites: Exploring patterns and mechanisms of an inverse latitudinal diversity gradient,"AimOne of the most consistent global biogeographic patterns is the latitudinal diversity gradient where species richness peaks within the equatorial tropics and decreases towards the poles. Here, we explore the global biogeography of socially parasitic ant species, which comprises the most diverse group of social parasites in the Hymenoptera. We test the biogeographic hypothesis that ant social parasites are distributed along an inverse latitudinal diversity gradient (iLDG) by peaking in diversity outside of the equatorial tropics, which would contrast with the biogeographic pattern observed in free-living, non-parasitic ant species. LocationGlobal. TaxonAnts (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). MethodsWe assembled a comprehensive biogeographic dataset consisting of 6001 geographic distribution records for all 371 taxonomically described socially parasitic ant species. We used phylogenetic and taxonomic studies to estimate the number of independent evolutionary origins of ant social parasitism to directly compare species richness with the number of species representing independent evolutionary origins of social parasitism across a latitudinal gradient. In addition, we compared ant social parasite diversity across biogeographic regions using rarefaction to account for different sampling efforts. Finally, we tested for a correlation between latitude and the proportion of ant social parasite species within regional ant faunae. ResultsThe geographic distribution records and the inferred 91 independent evolutionary origins of socially parasitic life histories in ants show that both species richness and the number of species representing independent evolutionary origins of social parasitism peak in the northern hemisphere outside of the equatorial tropics. Based on rarefaction curves, northern latitude regions harbour the most ant social parasite species, but the diversity of independent evolutionary origins is not significantly different between northern and southern hemispheres. The proportion of ant social parasite species within regional faunae is tightly correlated with latitude only in the northern hemisphere. Main conclusionsThe iLDG of ant social parasites contrasts with the biogeographic pattern observed in free-living, non-parasitic ant species and appears to be driven by large species radiations as well as by the presence of specialized life histories exclusive to the northern hemisphere.",biodiversity; dulosis; Formicidae; inquilinism; social parasitism,2023,50,2,10.1111/jbi.14528,0305-0270,16,123,329,2426,5,15,300,10,Yes,325,275,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,Global patterns and drivers of herbivorous eriophyoid mite species diversity,"AimEnvironmental drivers and host richness play key roles in affecting herbivore diversity. However, the relative effects of these factors and their effects on lineages characterized by high host specificity are not well known. In this study, we explored the extent to which contemporary climate, Quaternary climate change, habitat heterogeneity and host plants determine the species richness and endemism patterns of herbivorous eriophyoid mites. LocationGlobal. TaxonEriophyoid mites (Acari: Eriophyoidea). MethodsWe compiled a dataset comprising 4278 eriophyoid mite species from 22,973 occurrence sites based on a comprehensive search of the published literature and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as a basis for predicting their global distribution patterns. We measured the association of environmental variables and host plant richness with species richness and endemism of eriophyoid mites through multiple regression analyses using a simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model, an ordinary least squares (OLS) model and a random forest model. We examined the direct and indirect effects of these environmental variables and the host plant richness on eriophyoid mite diversity using structural equation models (SEMs). ResultsThe species richness and endemism patterns of eriophyoid mites are concentrated in temperate regions. Contemporary climate, Quaternary climate change, habitat heterogeneity and host plants all significantly affected eriophyoid mite richness, while Quaternary climate change, habitat heterogeneity and host plants contributed to the eriophyoid mite endemism. Abiotic factors indirectly influenced the species richness and endemism of eriophyoid mites, via biotic factors-host plants.

JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,Higher growth synchrony and climate change-sensitivity in European beech and silver linden than in temperate oaks,"AimClimatic changes affect the growth dynamics of temperate trees, but these effects might differ between co-occurring ring- and diffuse-porous species as well as between mesic and xeric rear-edge populations. We explore whether recent climate warming has increased the climate sensitivity and within-stand synchrony of growth in these groups differently. LocationThe natural beech-oak ecotone in Western Romania at the dry margin of beech occurrence. TaxaThree ring-porous oak species (Quercus petraea, Q. frainetto and Q. cerris), and diffuse-porous European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and silver linden (Tilia tomentosa). MethodsWe correlated tree-ring records with monthly and seasonal climate data (period 1940-2017). Regional growth synchrony was assessed through the analysis of inter-series correlation of growth within populations and among populations using mixed models. ResultsIn all five species including two south-east European oak taxa and silver linden, water availability in summer was the most important climatic determinant of radial growth. This factor has gained in importance since the onset of rapid warming after 1980, while the impact of other climate factors in spring and summer has decreased. Within-population growth synchrony as a measure of overall climatic stress has increased, or remained stable, since 1980 in beech and silver linden, but has decreased in the oak species, matching declining growth trends in beech and linden and increasing (or stable) trends in the oaks. Main ConclusionsThe patterns of growth synchrony provide valuable information on tree species' drought susceptibility in efforts to select suitable tree species for climate change-adapted forestry.

JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,Host phylogeny and elevation predict infection by avian haemosporidians in a diverse New Guinean bird community,"Aim: The biotic interactions hypothesis predicts that interactions between species are stronger at lower elevations compared to higher elevations. We tested whether this prediction is met by examining elevational patterns in avian haemosporidian infections in New Guinean birds. Location: YUS Conservation Area, Papua New Guinea. Taxon: Birds and haemosporidia. Methods: We collected blood samples from 2268 individuals of 66 bird species along a reef-to-ridgetop tropical elevational gradient covering similar to 3000 m of elevation. We used molecular methods to screen samples for haemosporidian parasites, and sequenced 70\% of positive infections to determine the identity of parasite genera. We fit a phylogenetic generalized mixed-effects model to test whether infection prevalence was higher at low elevations, as predicted by the biotic interactions hypothesis. Finally, we tested for phylogenetic signal in parasite prevalence and in host elevational distribution using Pagel's lambda. Results: Overall parasite prevalence was 45\%. Infection prevalence decreased with elevation, though prevalence remained above similar to 30\% even for high-elevation communities between 2000 and 3000 m. We found strong phylogenetic signal in infection prevalence, but no phylogenetic signal in host elevational distribution. Nearly all sequenced infections (97\%) were of Haemoproteus. Main Conclusions: Our results are consistent with predictions arising from the biotic interactions hypothesis. However, phylogenetic relationships among hosts are a much better predictor of infection prevalence than is elevational position: closely related bird species tend to have similar infection prevalence regardless of the elevations where they live.",altitudinal gradient; avian malaria; biotic interactions; blood parasite; elevational gradient; parasites; phylogenetic signal; tropical mountain,2023,50,1,10.1111/jbi.14524,0305-0270,16,111,237,1739,8,15,300,10,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,The `island syndrome' is an alternative state,"Aim In the half-century since publication of the Theory of Island Biology, ecologists have come to recognize the importance of predation as a decisive determinant of alternate states in many ecosystems. Island species are notorious for their vulnerability to introduced predators, yet the strength of island predator regimes has not been fully incorporated into our understanding of the forces that structure island consumer communities. Location The Greater and Lesser Antilles. Taxon Birds and Anolis lizards. Methods Field surveys of sclerophyll and rainforest sites on islands ranging in size from 3.5 km(2) Terre-de-Haut to 76,000 km(2) Hispaniola. Results Evidence gathered in the 1970s and 1980s shows that Antillean anoles live at higher densities on fewer resources, grow more slowly, reproduce later and live longer than mainland counterparts in conformity with the `island syndrome'. Data from this period show that Antillean bird communities display density overcompensation, community saturation, size-structured foraging guilds, low species diversity and low species packing, all traits consistent with the island syndrome and a regime of low predation and intense competition. Mainland species and communities display none of these features. Main conclusions I propose that the island syndrome is an alternative state that distinguishes low-predation island communities from high-predation mainland counterparts. It follows that strong mainland predation regimes tend to prevent island species from colonizing. Conversely, invasion-resistant, size-structured island communities, despite low species diversity, prevent mainland species from colonizing islands.

Teide, namely the species shown in A. von Humboldt's (1817) Tableau Physique des Iles Canaries (TPIC), which is based on his own 1799 visit and an 1815 visit by L. von Buch and C. Smith. The analysis is of interest in the context of climate change and biotic changes, such as the eradication of non-native goats from the Teide National Park. Between 1944 and 2010, the summit region of Mt. Teide has warmed at a rate of 0.14 degrees C/decade. Location Mt. Teide on Tenerife, Canary Islands. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods We updated the taxonomy of the 197 species shown in the TPIC, data-mined publications and letters, searched relevant herbaria for surviving collections, and compared historic and modern species presence, absence and elevational ranges. Results Both Humboldt and Buch had to use formulas to convert barometer readings into elevations above sea level, and none of Humboldt's collections and few of Buch's are linked to precise elevations. The upper range limits of all 23 species for which we found data have shifted upward, with the average shift being 36.4 m per decade (1799/1815-2021). Four species that today are abundant were not recorded in 1815, suggesting population expansion, probably due to goat eradication.

JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,"Polyhydroxy Acids as Fabaceous Plant Components Induce Oviposition of the Common Grass Yellow Butterfly, Eurema Mandarina","The common grass yellow butterfly, Eurema mandarina is a Fabaceae-feeding species, the females of which readily oviposit on Albizia julibrissin and Lespedeza cuneata in mainland Japan. We previously demonstrated that the methanolic leaf extracts of these plants, and their highly polar aqueous fractions strongly elicit female oviposition. Furthermore, the three subfractions obtained by ion-exchange chromatographic separation of the aqueous fraction have been found to be less effective alone, but synergistically stimulate female oviposition when combined. This indicates that female butterflies respond to multiple compounds with different acidity. We have previously identified d-pinitol from the neutral/amphoteric subfractions and glycine betaine from the basic subfractions as oviposition stimulants of E. mandarina. The present study aimed to identify active compounds in the remaining acidic subfractions of A. julibrissin and L. cuneata leaf extracts. GC-MS analyses of trimethylsilyl-derivatized samples revealed the presence of six compounds in the acidic subfractions. In bioassays using these authentic chemicals, erythronic acid (EA) and threonic acid (TA) were moderately active in eliciting oviposition responses in E. mandarina, with their d-isomers showing slightly higher activity than their l-isomers. Female responsiveness differed between d-EA and l-TA, the major isomers of these compounds in plants, with the response to d-EA reaching a plateau at concentrations above 0.005\% and that to l-TA peaking at a concentration of 0.01\%. The natural concentrations of d-EA and l-TA in fresh A. julibrissin and L. cuneata leaves were sufficient to stimulate oviposition. Furthermore, mixing 0.001\% d-EA or 0.001\% l-TA, to which females are mostly unresponsive, with 0.1\% d-pinitol resulted in a synergistic enhancement of the oviposition response. These findings demonstrate that E. mandarina females utilize both polyhydroxy acids, EA and TA, as chemical cues for oviposition.",Butterfly; Eurema mandarina; Oviposition; Polyhydroxy acids; Aldonic acids,2023,49,1-Feb,10.1007/s10886-022-01397-9,0098-0331,16,121,279,1999,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,"A Synthetic Blend of Fruit and Live Yeast Odours Shows Promise for Trapping Mated Female Queensland Fruit Fly, Bactrocera tryoni, in the Field","Tephritid fruit flies are major horticultural pests of fruit and vegetable crops. Developing an odour lure that can attract mated female flies under field conditions has presented a major challenge to chemical ecologists around the globe. We have designed a new lure to attract female Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni, based on the knowledge that this pest tephritid is attracted not only to odours from ripening fruits, but also to odours of symbiotic (gut-associated) yeasts on which the larvae feed. Initial field trials screened four volatile mixtures, each containing a base mix of three, short-chain ``fruit ripening{'' esters and differing in the addition of long-chain ``fruity{''} esters and / or alcohols produced by live yeasts. Results demonstrated that the lure formulated from short-chain esters and live yeast alcohols attracted the most female flies, with significantly higher catches than an odourless control trap, and a protein-baited trap. As electrophysiological studies exploring peripheral responses in tephritids to alcohols associated with fermentation have not been extensively investigated, we conducted this work on both the antennae and maxillary palps, and discovered that three yeast alcohols were detected by both sensory organs. Performance trials conducted in pome fruit and stone fruit orchards evaluated the six-component blend of short-chain ester and live yeast alcohol lure against a commercially available synthetic fruit-odour lure and a protein-based lure. In the apple orchard, the new lure caught significantly more female flies, and in particular mated females, compared to the commercially available lures. In the stone fruit orchard, while the new lure again caught the most mated female flies compared to the other lures, differences were not significant. The visual stimulus (trap design) used had a significant effect on capture, with a Ladd trap (red sphere on a yellow panel) being considerably more effective than the other traps.

JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,Cinnamomeoventrolide - Double Bond Regioisomerism in Frog Semiochemicals,"Frogs of the families Mantellinae and Hyperoliidae possess male specific femoral or gular glands that are used during courtship. These glands release volatile compounds, e. g. the macrocyclic lactone gephyromantolide A (2,6,10-trimethyl-6-undecen-11-olide) in the case of Gephyromantis boulengeri (Mantellinae). During the analysis of the volatiles of Hyperolius cinnamomeoventris (Hyperoliidae) we detected an unknown compound A, which we called cinnamomeoventrolide, whose mass spectrum showed high similarity with the spectrum of gephyromantolide A. Nevertheless, slight spectral differences led to the proposal of a regioisomer of gephyromantolide A as a structure for A, 2,6,10-trimethyl-5-undecen-11-olide. A versatile synthesis of this compound was developed to allow access to all four stereoisomers from a single chiral starting material, the so-called (S)-Roche ester, using ring-closing metathesis as a key step. With these stereoisomers, the absolute configuration of the natural product was established to have the (2R,10S)-configuration by GC on a chiral phase. The configuration of natural gephyromantolide A is the opposite. Both frogs seem to use a similar biosynthetic pathway to access the target compounds, differing in the stereochemistry of the reduction steps, and requiring an additional isomerization in case of G. boulengeri. This unique regioisomeric differentiation of double bonds in semiochemicals has so far only been observed in insects. The compounds are likely to play a role in species-recognition of the frogs.",Anurans; Enantioselective synthesis; Frog semiochemicals; Macrocyclic lactones; Mass spectra; Pheromones,2022,48,"5-6, SI",10.1007/s10886-022-01370-6,0098-0331,8,72,216,1546,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,Combined Elevation of Temperature and CO2 Impacts the Production and Sugar Composition of Aphid Honeydew,"Honeydew is the keystone of many interactions between aphids and their predators, parasitoids, and mutualistic partners. Despite the crucial importance of honeydew in aphid-ant mutualism, very few studies have investigated the potential impacts of climate change on its production and composition. Here, we quantified changes in sugar compounds and the amount of honeydew droplets released by Aphis fabae reared on Vicia faba plants under elevated temperature and/or CO2 conditions. Following the combined elevation of these two abiotic factors, we found a significant increase in the fructose content of A. fabae honeydew, accompanied by nonsignificant trends of increase in total honeydew production and melezitose content. The environmental conditions tested in this study did not significantly impact the other honeydew sugar contents. The observed changes may be related to changes in phloem composition under elevated CO2 conditions as well as to increases in aphid metabolism and sap ingestion under elevated temperatures. Although limited, such changes in aphid honeydew may concurrently reinforce ant attendance and mutualism under elevated temperature and CO2 conditions. Finally, we discuss the enhancing and counteracting effects of climate change on other biological agents (gut microorganisms, predators, and parasitoids) that interact with aphids in a complex multitrophic system.",Climate change; Sugars; Honeydew; Aphids; Mutualism,2022,48,9-Oct,10.1007/s10886-022-01385-z,0098-0331,15,104,198,1395,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,"Components of the Female Sex Pheromone of the Newly-Described Canola Flower Midge, Contarinia brassicola","The canola flower midge, Contarinia brassicola Sinclair (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), is a newly-described species that induces galls on canola, Brassica napus Linnaeus and Brassica rapa Linnaeus (Brassicaceae). Identification of the sex pheromone of C. brassicola is essential to developing monitoring tools to elucidate the geographic range and hosts of this new pest, and the extent to which it threatens the \$30 billion Canadian canola industry. The aim of this study was to identify and synthesize the female-produced sex pheromone of C. brassicola and demonstrate its effectiveness in attracting males to traps in the field. Two peaks were identified through GC-EAG analysis of female-produced volatiles which elicited electrophysiological responses in male antennae. These peaks were initially characterized through GC-MS and synthesis as 2,7-diacetoxynonane (major component) and 2-acetoxynonane (minor component), and the racemic compounds elicited EAG responses in male antennae. All four stereoisomers of 2,7-diacetoxynonane were synthesized and the naturally-produced compound was shown to be primarily the (2R,7S)-isomer by analysis on an enantioselective GC column, with a small amount of (2R,7R)-2,7-diacetoxynonane also present. The configuration of the minor component could not be determined because of the small amount present, but this was assumed to be (2R)-2-acetoxynonane by comparison with the configuration of the other two components. In field trials, none of the four stereoisomers of 2,7-diacetoxynonane, presented individually or as a racemic mixture, was attractive to male C. brassicola. However, dispensers loaded with a 10 mu g:1 mu g blend of (2R,7S)- and (2R,7R)-2,7-diacetoxynonane caught large numbers of male C. brassicola and significantly more than other blends tested. The addition of 0.5 mu g of (2R)-2-acetoxynonane to this blend further increased the number of males caught. In future work, we will seek to identify the optimum trapping protocol for the application of the pheromone in monitoring and surveillance.","Canola flower midge; Cecidomyiidae; Oilseed rape; Brassica; 2-Acetoxynonane; 2, 7-Diacetoxynonane; Stereochemistry",2022,48,"5-6, SI",10.1007/s10886-022-01369-z,0098-0331,14,104,295,2055,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes

To establish the correlation between the stereochemistry of the pheromone and its bioactivity, it first was necessary to determine its absolute configuration. For this purpose, a series of syntheses were designed to: (a) furnish a mixture of all possible stereoisomers; (b) a narrowed down group of diastereomers, and (c) one specific enantiomer. A crucial step in the syntheses involved a coupling reaction between two key intermediates: a phosphonium salt and an aldehyde, through a Wittig olefination. Nuclear magnetic resonance data of a mixture of the synthetic pheromone diastereomers and further comparison of GC retention times with that of the natural product by gas chromatography suggested that the methyl branches at C2 and C4 were in a syn relationship, reducing the possibilities to only four of the eight possible stereoisomers. Employing GC analysis, chiral derivatization reagents and synthetic (8R)-2,4-syn-1 it was possible to confirm the configuration of the methyl branch at C8 as R, reducing the number of possible stereoisomers to two. After enantioselective synthesis of (2R,4R,8R)-1, the absolute configurations of all methyl branches of the natural compound were confirmed as R, fully identifying the male-produced sex pheromone of P. stictica as (2R,4R,8R)-2,4,8,13-tetramethyltetradecan-1-ol.",Semiochemicals; Chemical Ecology; Pentatomidae; Gas chromatography; Chiral derivatization reagents,2022,48,"5-6, SI",10.1007/s10886-022-01371-5,0098-0331,24,226,219,1521,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

However, sex pheromones for Agriotes click beetle species native to North America have yet to be identified. Here we report the identification and field testing of the sex pheromone of Agriotes ferrugineipennis. Headspace volatiles from female beetles were collected on Porapak Q, and aliquots of Porapak extract were analyzed by gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and GC-mass spectrometry. 7-Methyloctyl 7-methyloctanoate (7Me7Me) emitted by females was more abundant and elicited much stronger responses from male antennae than the aldehydes octanal and nonanal and the ketone 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone. In a field experiment, captures of A. ferrugineipennis males in traps baited with candidate pheromone components exceeded those of unbaited control traps, on average by nearly 1,200 times. Neither the ketone nor the aldehydes as lure constituents appeared to alter captures of males in 7Me7Me-baited traps.

The larvae are minor defoliators of agricultural pasture. We investigated the sex pheromone of this species. Analysis of extract of the female sex pheromone gland identified six compounds: two monounsaturated compounds, (Z)-11-hexadecenal (Z11-16:Ald) and (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate (Z11-16:Ac), three saturated compounds, hexadecanal (16:Ald), hexadecyl acetate (16:Ac) and octadecan-1-ol (18:OH), and a triene hydrocarbon, (3Z,6Z,9Z)-tricosatriene (Z3Z6Z9-23:Hy). Several field-trapping experiments testing combinations of the six compounds were conducted. Results suggested that males of two different populations of T. atristriga responded differently to different blends of the compounds. Males of one population responded equally to a two-component blend as to other blends, including the one with all six compounds. By contrast, males of the second population responded only to the six-component blend or a ternary blend of Z11-16:Ald, Z11-16:Ac and Z3Z6Z9-23:Hy. In experiments testing different doses of Z11-16:Ald and Z11-16:Ac in a binary or a six-component blend, a 1 mg dose of the binary blend gave the greatest male catch for both populations.

Si enhances plant resistance against phytophagous insects through physical and biochemical mechanisms. In particular, Si modifies jasmonic acid levels and the emissions of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Here, we investigated whether Si accumulation in the tissues of maize leaves modifies the emissions of constitutive and herbivore-induced plant volatiles, with cascade deterrent effects on oviposition site selection by Spodoptera exigua Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Maize plants were cultivated in a hydroponic system under three Si concentrations, resulting in three groups of plants expressing different Si concentrations in their tissues (0.31 +/- 0.04, 4.69 +/- 0.49, and 9.56 +/- 0.30 g Si. Kg(- 1) DW). We collected volatiles from undamaged and caterpillar-infested plants, and found that Si concentration in plant tissues had no significant impact. Jasmonic acid content was high in insect-infested plants, but was similar across all Si treatments. Oviposition site selection bioassays using fertilized S. exigua females showed that Si concentration in plant tissues did not affect the number of eggs laid on Si-treated plants.

Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) have been shown to often have higher heat resistance than natives, but studies investigating how forthcoming global warming might affect them in marine urban environments remain scarce, especially in Situ studies. Here we used an in Situ warming experiment in a NW Mediterranean (warm temperate) and a NE Atlantic (cold temperate) marina to see how global warming might affect recruited communities in the near future. In both marinas, warming resulted in significantly different community structure, lower biomass, and more empty space compared to control. However, while in the warm temperate marina, NIS showed an increased surface cover, it was reduced in the cold temperate one. Metabolomic analyses on Bugula neritina in the Atlantic marina revealed potential heat stress experienced by this introduced bryozoan and a potential link between heat stress and the expression of a halogenated alkaloid, Caelestine A.

JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,Links Between Feeding Preferences and Electroantennogram Response Profiles in Dung Beetles: The Importance of Dung Odor Bouquets,"The detection of dung odors is a crucial step in the food-searching behavior of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea). Yet, whether certain compounds characteristic of a given dung type contribute to a `choosy generalism' behavior proposed for this taxonomic group is unknown. To address this, we analyzed the chemical composition of three types of dung (cow, horse, and rabbit) and conducted behavioral and electroantennogram (EAG) bioassays on 15 species of dung beetles using 19 volatile organic compounds representing the three dung samples. Chemical analyses revealed substantial qualitative and quantitative differences among dung types. When offered these food options in an olfactometer, 14 species exhibited a feeding preference. Surprisingly, all 19 compounds used in the EAG assays elicited antennal responses, with species displaying different olfactory profiles. The relationship between behavioral preferences and electrophysiological profiles highlighted that species with different food preferences had differences in antennal responses. Moreover, a specific set of EAG-active compounds (nonanal, sabinene, acetophenone, rho-cresol, 2-heptanone, 1H-indole, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one) were the strongest drivers in the distinct sensory profiles of the trophic preference groups.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the variability of the primary metabolites of phloem saps from 10 different species of pine by NMR spectroscopy, as well as the aroma compounds using SPME-GC-MS. Each technique provided a different set of metabolites that we can correlate to monkey predilection. The PCA showed monosaccharide (detected by NMR) and alpha-pinene (pine-like and resinous flavor descriptors) as attractive compounds for monkeys. On the other hand, the low content of monosaccharide and the high content of beta-phellandrene (citrus odor descriptor) was observed in less attacked pine species (P. patula). The data fusion on primary metabolites and aroma compounds corroborated the individual analyses, complementing the comprehension of the monkey predilection. Thus, P. elliottii was an avoided tree even with high content of sugars possibly due to its high content of beta-phellandrene (citrus odor). The results are useful for further behavioral studies to determine the role that each highlighted metabolite plays in chemically mediated animal-plant interactions.",Capuchin monkey; Phloem sap; NMR; SPME-GC-MS; Data fusion,2022,NA,NA,10.1007/s10886-022-01365-3,0098-0331,14,98,189,1281,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Biogenic amines, including octopamine, are neuromodulators that have been shown to modulate insect reproduction in various ways, e.g., promote or inhibit insect mating or oviposition. In this study, we examined the role of octopamine in regulating the reproduction behaviors of a devastating underground insect pest, the dark black chafer (Holotrichia parallela). We first measured the abundance of octopamine in different neural tissues of the adult chafer pre- and post-mating, demonstrating that octopamine decreased in the abdominal ganglia of females but increased in males post-mating. We then fed the adult H. parallela with a concentration gradient of octopamine to test the effects on insect reproductive behaviors. Compared with its antagonist mianserin, octopamine at the concentration of 2 mu g/mL resulted in the highest increase in males' preference for sex pheromone and females' oviposition, whereas the mianserin-treatment increased the survival rate and prolonged the lifespan of H. parallela. In addition, we did not observe significant differences in egg hatchability between octopamine and mianserin-treated H. parallela. Our results demonstrated that octopamine promotes H. parallela mating and oviposition with a clear low dosage effect, illustrated how neural substrates modulate insect behaviors, and provided insights for applying octopamine in pest management.",Holotrichia parallela; Octopamine; Reproduction; Mating; Oviposition; Egg hatchability; Survival rate,2022,NA,NA,10.1007/s10886-022-01366-2,0098-0331,6,50,206,1468,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

In Y-tube olfactometer tests, we found H. armigera females and males both showed significant behavioral responses to odors from walnut branches. Furthermore, nine electrophysiologically active volatiles (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, myrcene, limonene, eucalyptol, ocimene, beta-caryophyllene, (E)-beta-farnesene, and germacrene D) were identified from walnuts with gas chromatography coupled with electroantennography (GC-EAD) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Among these volatiles, beta-pinene and eucalyptol were released in relatively higher amounts. In electroantennogram (EAG) dose-dependent trials, all compounds evoked responses in H. armigera adults when tested at high concentrations, with germacrene D evoking the greatest response. In wind tunnel tests, H. armigera females preferred eight of the electrophysiologically active volatile dilutions compared with clean air, while males showed preference for only five compounds.

We studied the effects of nitrate fertilization (low versus high) on various plant responses towards a pathogenic fungus, Alternaria brassicae, and a herbivorous insect species, Mamestra brassicae, in a population of Bunias orientalis, which is invasive in parts of central Europe. Aboveground biomass and leaf trichome density were enhanced in plants under high fertilization. In contrast, the short-term fungal infection and herbivory had no effect on aboveground biomass. Leaf water, nitrogen content and glucosinolate concentrations were neither affected by fertilization nor in response to antagonist attack. The total soluble sugar content, especially fructose, as well as leaf peroxidase activity increased significantly in leaves upon fungal infection, but independent of fertilization. Larval biomass gain and herbivore survival were likewise unaffected by fertilization. Our findings highlight that under conditions of high fertilization, B. orientalis plants allocate more resources into growth and morphological defenses than chemical defenses.

JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,Sex Pheromone of the Azalea Mealybug With a Non-Terpene Structure,"Mealybug females release sex pheromones to attract conspecific males for mating. It is critical for mealybug males, which are fragile and short-lived, to respond to the pheromone of their species without time- and energy-consuming cross-attractions to other species. Thus, mealybug pheromone systems are considered to have evolved to be species-specific with unique structures in each species and offer an opportunity to study the diversity of pheromone chemistry that mediates intersexual courtship signals. More than 20 mealybug pheromones are reported to be monoterpenes in general, with only one exception, a hemiterpene alcohol esterified with a medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA), found in the Matsumoto mealybug, Crisicoccus matsumotoi. However, it is unknown whether this is truly exceptional, or if similar compounds are used in other related mealybugs. In this study, we isolated and characterized the pheromone of an allied species, the azalea mealybug C. azaleae. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and bioassays with synthetics, the pheromone was shown to be composed of isopropyl (E)-7-methyl-4-nonenoate, isopropyl (E)-7-methyl-4-octenoate, and ethyl (E)-7-methyl-4-nonenoate. Surprisingly, the structures of these compounds do not include hemiterpene nor monoterpene motifs but have methyl-branched MCFA parts that are similar to an acid moiety of the C. matsumotoi pheromone.

JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Climate and forest attributes influence above-ground biomass of deciduous broadleaf forests in China,"Forests provide a huge carbon pool, a substantial portion of which is stored in above-ground biomass (AGB). Deciduous broadleaf forests in China are an essential component of global deciduous broadleaf forests, yet the impacts of climate and forest attributes on their AGB are not well understood. Using a comprehensive forest inventory database from 772 plots distributed across temperate and subtropical deciduous broadleaf forests in China (23.51 degrees-42.53 degrees N and 104.24 degrees-128.27 degrees E), we applied variance partitioning analysis, model selection analysis and structural equation models to explore how climate and forest attributes (species diversity, community-level functional traits and stand structures) affect AGB in different climatic forests (semi-arid forests, semi-humid forests and humid forests). Community-level functional traits and stand structures together explained a great portion of the variance in AGB. The effect of community-level functional traits was greater than that of stand structures in semi-arid forests and semi-humid forests, but smaller in humid forests. Further analyses showed that community-level maximum tree height, stem density and tree size inequality were important explanatory variables. Although climate and species diversity had minor effects, the direct positive effect of mean annual precipitation (MAP) was still important, especially in semi-arid forests. Synthesis. Community-level functional traits but not species diversity were key drivers of AGB, indicating that tree species diversity loss may not impair AGB substantially in deciduous broadleaf forests in China.

JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Community biomass is driven by dominants and their characteristics - The insight from a field biodiversity experiment with realistic species loss scenario,"Revealing the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning (BEF) has been a major focus of ecological research over recent decades. In general, results from artificially assembled communities point to the important role of biodiversity showing that loss of species has a negative effect on various ecosystem functions (mostly assessed by above-ground peak biomass). However, the evidence from manipulations of natural communities is scarce, and results are often contradictory between these two approaches. In particular, the importance of species dominance for ecosystem functioning remains poorly understood. We created a gradient of plant species richness in a meadow community following a realistic species loss scenario (removal of less abundant species) to test the effect of diversity on community biomass and assess the importance of subordinate species compared with dominants in a 5-year experiment. Contrasting with results of BEF experiments with artificial assembly, we did not find any relationship between plant species diversity and above-ground biomass across the timeframe of the experiment. We provide evidence that dominant species' identity and traits are the main drivers of community biomass because dominant species were able to maintain biomass production after substantial species loss. Furthermore, dominants prevented community biomass from declining and biomass was indirectly influenced not by species richness but through differences in functional diversity. Our results support the mass ratio hypothesis, showing much bigger effect of dominant species on community biomass production and hints to the rather minor importance of the complementarity effect between species. We emphasize that BEF research should more focus on the role of dominant species in maintaining various ecosystem functions. Synthesis. Species diversity is a poor predictor of community above-ground biomass production and dominant species can effectively compensate the total production after substantial loss of other species in a grassland community.",biodiversity; biodiversity experiment; dominant species; ecosystem functioning; functional diversity; productivity; removal experiment; species loss,2023,111,1,10.1111/1365-2745.14029,0022-0477,22,154,291,2058,8,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Dispersal and coastal geomorphology limit potential for mangrove range expansion under climate change,"Latitudinal range limits for mangroves on high-energy, wave-dominated coasts are controlled by geomorphological features and estuarine dynamics. Mangroves reach a southern global range limit along the South African coastline, but the distribution is patchy, with stands occurring in only 16\% of the estuaries in the region. Yet, the persistence of forests planted >50 years ago beyond the natural distribution limit suggests that additional estuaries could support mangroves. Understanding regional drivers is necessary to inform global-scale estimates for how this important ecosystem is predicted to respond to climate change. Here, we combine species distribution modelling (MaxEnt), Lagrangian particle tracking using an eddy- and tide-resolving numerical ocean model, and connectivity matrices, to identify suitable mangrove habitats along the South African coastline at present, as well as under the IPCC RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios. Within the current South African distribution range (+/- 900 km), eight more estuaries were identified to be suitable under contemporary conditions. When considering potential range extension (+/- 110 km), an additional 14 suitable estuaries were identified. Connectivity matrices suggest limited long-distance dispersal, stranding mostly at or near the release location, and a decreased probability of connectivity towards the range limit. Under both future climate scenarios, 30\% of estuaries currently supporting mangroves are predicted to become unsuitable, while an additional six estuaries beyond the current distribution are predicted to become suitable. However, there is limited connectivity between these new sites and established forests. Synthesis. This study shows that dispersal substantially limits mangrove distribution at the southern African range limit and highlights the importance of including this process in species distribution models. Ultimately, our results provide new insight into mangrove conservation and management at range limits that are not controlled predominantly by temperature, as it has been assumed that mangroves will largely expand to higher latitudes under climate change.",Avicennia marina; climate change; coastal wetland; dispersal limitation; Lagrangian particle tracking; range expansion; South Africa; species distribution modelling,2023,111,1,10.1111/1365-2745.14020,0022-0477,13,101,299,2165,8,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Drying conditions alter the defensive function of seed mucilage against granivores,"Environmental conditions alter the function of many plant traits that drive species interactions, producing context-dependency in the outcomes of those interactions. Seed mucilage is a common, convergently evolved trait found in thousands of plant species. When wetted, the seed coat swells into a viscid mass; when dried, the mucilage strands strongly cement the seed to whatever it is in contact with. This binding to the ground has been previously shown to protect seeds from granivory. Previous research found both that mucilage volume-and the correlated attachment strength-are higher in species from hot, dry, areas suggesting an environmental component of this trait's function. Here, we (1) quantified the effect of temperature on attachment across many species in a lab setting, (2) tested the potential mechanism behind this correlation by accelerating desiccation speed without changing temperature, and (3) tested whether these relationships introduce context dependency of the defensive function of mucilage in the field, using field trials with harvester ants. We found that (1) increasing temperature during mucilage drying strongly reduced the force needed to dislodge seeds for most species, (2) drying time was likely the driving mechanism behind the loss of attachment strength at higher temperatures, not temperature per se, (3) seeds attached to substrate during higher temperatures or under accelerated drying conditions were far more susceptible to granivory. Synthesis. These results show not only the mechanism behind an abiotic modification of a functional trait of seeds, but that this change majorly alters a key interaction contributing to seed survival. These results add to a small, but growing, literature on the importance of seed mucilage in seed survival and demonstrate strong and largely predictable context-dependency in this trait's defensive function.",NA,2023,111,2,10.1111/1365-2745.14044,0022-0477,11,82,278,1891,NA,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Ectomycorrhizal (dipterocarp) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (non-dipterocarp) tree hosts and their relative distribution in a tropical forest predict soil bacterial communities,"The type of mycorrhizal associations (i.e. ectomycorrhizal {[}EM] or arbuscular mycorrhizal {[}AM]) formed by trees is of fundamental importance for a range of soil properties and processes in forests, yet their importance for the distribution of other important soil biota such as bacteria is largely unknown. We used an experimental common garden and amplicon sequencing to assess how abiotic and biotic variation differentially influenced bacterial communities associated with 13 climax tree species (8 EM members of the Dipterocarpaceae and 5 AM species from different families) planted into a secondary tropical forest in Borneo. Rhizosphere bacterial (RB) communities differed significantly between EM and AM trees but not among EM species and only marginally among AM species. RB communities were related to the density and size of neighbouring EM but not AM trees. Diversity of RB on AM trees responded positively to AM neighbours and negatively to EM neighbours but RB diversity associated with EM trees was unaffected by neighbourhood. Plant-growth-promoting taxa of RB assorted similarly to total RB but more strongly. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the distribution of RB communities is associated with plant mycorrhizal type and plant neighbourhood.

JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Effects of warming temperatures on germination responses and trade-offs between seed traits in an alpine plant,"Climate warming may affect multiple aspects of plant life history, including important factors such as germination responses and the key trade-off between offspring size and number. As a case study to address these concepts, we used an alpine plant (waxy bluebell, Wahlenbergia ceracea; Campanulaceae) that shows plasticity to warming in seed traits and in which seed dormancy status regulates germination. We chose an alpine species because alpine environments are ecosystems particularly under threat by climate change. We conducted germination assays under cool and warm temperatures using seeds produced by individuals that were grown under historical (cooler) and future (warmer) temperature scenarios. We assessed the presence of a seed size versus number trade-off, and then examined the effects of seed number and size on germination percentage, the fractions of dormant and viable seeds, and germination velocity. Further, we examined whether warming during parental growth and during germination affected these relationships. We found evidence for a seed size versus number trade-off only under historical parental temperatures. Indeed, under future growth temperatures parental plants produced fewer and smaller seeds and there was no evidence of a trade-off. However, the reductions in both seed traits under warming did not affect germination, despite correlations of seed size and number with germination traits. Warming increased germination, particularly of larger seeds, but overall, it resulted in more than fourfold reductions in parental fitness. Synthesis. Our study shows the importance of growth conditions when evaluating the seed size versus number trade-off. Stressful conditions, such as warmer temperatures, can restrain the ability of plants to reach optimal investment in reproduction, masking the trade-off. By analysing responses across the whole life cycle, we show here an overall detrimental effect of warming, highlighting the potential risk of climate change for Wahlenbergia ceracea, and, potentially, for alpine plant communities more widely.",alpine environments; fitness; germination responses; parental effects; phenotypic plasticity; seed dormancy; size vs; number trade-off; warming,2023,111,1,10.1111/1365-2745.14014,0022-0477,16,110,299,2081,9,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Experimental evidence that leaf litter decomposability and flammability are decoupled across gymnosperm species,"Biological decomposition and wildfire are two predominant and alternative processes that can mineralize organic C in forest litter. Currently, the relationships between decomposition and fire are still poorly understood. We provide an empirical test of the hypothesized decoupling of surface litter bed decomposability and flammability, and the underlying traits and trait spectra. We employed a 41-species set of gymnosperms of very broad evolutionary and geographic spread, because of the wide range of (absent to frequent) fire regimes they are associated with. We found that the interspecific pattern of mass loss proportions in a ``common garden{''} decomposition experiment was not correlated with any of the flammability parameters and an RDA analysis also showed that the decomposability and flammability of leaf litter in litter layers were decoupled across species. This decoupling originates from the former depending mostly on size and shape spectrum traits and the latter on PES traits and those trait spectra being virtually uncorrelated. Synthesis: Our results show that, indeed, leaf litter decomposability and flammability parameters are decoupled across species, and this decoupling can be explained by their different drivers in terms of trait spectra: chemical traits for decomposability and size-shape traits for litter layer flammability.",biogeochemical cycling; decomposition; fire ecology; flammability; leaf litter quality; leaf shape; plant functional traits,2023,111,4,10.1111/1365-2745.14033,0022-0477,13,111,196,1360,7,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Fifty years of reduction in sulphur deposition drives recovery in soil pH and plant communities,"1. Sulphur deposition through rainfall has led to species loss and ecosystem degradation globally, and across Europe huge reductions in sulphur emissions since the 1970s were expected to promote the recovery of acidified ecosystems. However, the rate and ecological impact of recovery from acidification in terrestrial ecosystems is still unclear as is the influence of management and climate, as to date there has been no long-term spatially extensive evaluation of these changes. 2. Here, we present data from thousands of sites across Great Britain (pH range 3.3-8.7) surveyed repeatedly from 1978-2019 and assess change in soil pH and plant acidity preference (Ellenberg R) in response to atmospheric deposition of sulphur and nitrogen. We analyse change in grasslands managed for pasture, referred to as high-intensity habitats, and compare to seminatural habitats comprising rough grassland, broadleaved woodland, bog and heathland, referred to as low-intensity habitats. 3. Soil pH increased from 1978 to 2007 but then decreased between 2007 and 2019, resulting in a net increase of similar to 0.2 pH units in low-intensity habitats but no change in high-intensity habitats. The community average Ellenberg R increased in seminatural habitats by similar to 0.2 units but remained stable in intensive grasslands. 4. In seminatural habitats, but not intensive grasslands, these changes in plant community composition were associated with the soil pH changes which were in turn linked to decreasing sulphur deposition and differences in rainfall. 5. Nitrogen deposition, which was relatively stable over the survey period, showed no additional effect upon soil acidity once sulphur deposition was accounted for. 6. Synthesis: Our results provide conclusive evidence that reductions in acid emissions are stimulating the gradual recovery of chronically acidified terrestrial ecosystems at a whole-country scale, while also suggesting this recovery is being compromised by changing climate and land management.",atmospheric deposition; nitrogen deposition; plant community; precipitation; soil acidity; vegetation,2023,111,2,10.1111/1365-2745.14039,0022-0477,15,95,296,2012,6,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Higher-latitude spring-flowering herbs advance their phenology more than trees with warming temperatures,"The phenologies of co-occurring trees and spring-blooming understory herbs in northeastern North American hardwood forests appear to be regulated by different environmental drivers - air temperature and soil temperature/snowpack, respectively. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that climate change-driven asymmetry in the advancement of canopy leaf-out relative to the timing of understory growth could reduce photosynthetic rates and reproductive success of understory herbs through greater early-season shading. To determine whether trees and spring-flowering forest herbs are advancing their phenologies at different rates with respect to increasing global temperatures, we examined the phenological responses to warming of 10 species of trees and 11 species of spring-flowering forest herbs (8045 observations from 965 sites) in northeastern North America using 13 years of data collected by citizen scientists under the auspices of the USA-National Phenology Network. Contrary to expectation, the degree of advancement of leaf-out as a function of temperature was greater in spring-flowering forest herbs than in trees, with a mean response rate of -4.9 days/degrees C (95\% BCI {[}-5.2, -4.6]) for spring-flowering forest herbs vs. -3.3 days/degrees C (95\% BCI {[}-3.5, -3.1]) for trees. However, the response to temperature was not consistent across the latitudinal range, with spring-flowering forest herbs responding more strongly to warming than trees at middle (40-44 degrees N) and higher (45-48 degrees N) latitudes but not at lower latitudes (35-39 degrees N). Synthesis. In contrast to previous suggestions, our study shows spring-flowering forest herbs advancing their phenology at a higher rate than trees with respect to warming through most of the latitudinal range investigated, which could translate into a longer growing season and increased carbon uptake for spring-flowering forest herbs as spring temperatures rise.",climate change; phenology; spring ephemerals; temperate understory; latitudinal gradient; plant-plant interactions; phenological mismatch,2023,111,1,10.1111/1365-2745.14023,0022-0477,12,104,276,1945,7,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Landscape-scale drivers of liana load across a Southeast Asian forest canopy differ to the Neotropics,"Lianas (woody vines) are a key component of tropical forests, known to reduce forest carbon storage and sequestration and to be increasing in abundance. Analysing how and why lianas are distributed in forest canopies at landscape scales will help us determine the mechanisms driving changes in lianas over time. This will improve our understanding of liana ecology and projections of tropical forest carbon storage now and into the future. Despite competing hypotheses on the mechanisms driving spatial patterning of lianas, few studies have integrated multiple tree-level biotic and abiotic factors in an analytical framework. None have done so in the Palaeotropics, which are biogeographically and evolutionarily distinct from the Neotropics, where most research on lianas has been conducted. We used an unoccupied aerial system (UAS; drone) to assess liana load in 50-ha of Palaeotropical forest canopy in Southeast Asia. We obtained data on hypothesised drivers of liana spatial distribution in the forest canopy, including disturbance, tree characteristics, soil chemistry and topography, from the UAS, from airborne LiDAR and from ground surveys. We integrated these in a comprehensive analytical framework to extract variables at an individual-tree level and evaluated the relative strengths of the hypothesised drivers and their ability to predict liana distributions through boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling. Tree height and distance to canopy gaps were the two most important predictors of liana load, with relative contribution values in BRT models of 34.60\%-45.39\% and 7.93\%-10.19\%, respectively. Our results suggest that taller trees were less often and less heavily infested by lianas than shorter trees, opposite to Neotropical findings. Lianas also occurred more often, and to a greater extent, in tree crowns close to canopy gaps and to neighbouring trees with lianas in their crown. Synthesis. Despite their known importance and prevalence in tropical forests, lianas are not well understood, particularly in the Palaeotropics. Examining 2428 trees across 50-ha of Palaeotropical forest canopy in Southeast Asia, we find support for the hypothesis that canopy gaps promote liana infestation. However, we also found that liana presence and load declined with tree height, which is opposite to well-established Neotropical findings. This suggests a fundamental difference between Neotropical and Southeast Asian forests. Considering that most liana literature has focused on the Neotropics, this highlights the need for additional studies in other biogeographic regions to clarify potential differences and enable us to better understand liana impacts on tropical forest ecology, carbon storage and sequestration.",boosted regression trees; drone; gap ecology; liana ecology; remote sensing; tropical forest canopy science; UAV; unmanned aerial vehicle,2023,111,1,10.1111/1365-2745.14015,0022-0477,15,101,399,2740,8,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Legacy effects in radial tree growth are rarely significant after accounting for biological memory,"Drought legacies in radial tree growth are an important feature of variability in biomass accumulation and are widely used to characterize forest resilience to climate change. Defined as a deviation from normal growth, the statistical significance of legacy effects depends on the definition of ``normal{''}-expected growth under average conditions-which has not received sufficient scrutiny. We re-examined legacy effect analyses using the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) and then produced synthetic tree-ring data to disentangle four key variables influencing the magnitude of legacy effects. We hypothesized that legacy effects (i) are mainly influenced by the auto-correlation of the radial growth time series (phi), (ii) depend on climate-growth cross-correlation (rho), (iii) are directly proportional to the inherent variability of the growth time series (standard deviation, SD), and (iv) scale with the chosen extreme event threshold. Using a data simulation approach, we were able to reproduce observed lag patterns, demonstrating that legacy effects are a direct outcome of ubiquitous biological memory. We found that stronger legacy effects for conifers compared to angiosperms is a consequence of their higher auto-correlation, and that the detectability of legacy effects following rare drought events at individual sites is compromised by strong background stochasticity. Synthesis. We propose two pathways forward to improve the assessment and interpretation of legacy effects: First, we highlight the need to account for auto-correlated residuals of climate-growth regression models a posteriori, thereby retrospectively adjusting expectations for ``normal{''} growth variability. Alternatively, we recommend including lagged climate variables in regression models a priori. By doing so, the magnitude of detected legacy effects is greatly reduced and biological memory is directly attributed to antecedent climatic drivers. We argue that future analyses should focus on understanding the functional reasons for how and why key statistical parameters describing this biological memory differ across species and sites. These two pathways should also stimulate improved process-based representation of vegetation carbon dynamics in mechanistic models.",auto-correlation; biological memory; lag effect; recovery; resilience; superposed epoch analysis; synthetic data; tree rings,2023,111,6,10.1111/1365-2745.14045,0022-0477,14,98,313,2276,8,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Linking animal behaviour and tree recruitment: Caching decisions by a scatter-hoarder corvid determine seed fate in a Mediterranean agroforestry system,"Seed dispersal by scatter-hoarder corvids is key for the establishment of important tree species from the Holarctic region such as the walnut (Juglans regia). However, the factors that drive animal decisions to cache seeds in specific locations and the consequences of these decisions on seed fate are poorly understood. We experimentally created four distinct, replicated habitat types in a Mediterranean agricultural landscape where the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica) is a common scatter hoarder: soft bare soil; compacted bare soil; compacted soil with a dense herbaceous cover; and soft linear bare soil made up of the irrigation furrows that separated the rest of the treatments. We also experimentally placed visual landmarks (stones, sticks and bunches of dry plants) to test if magpies use them to place seed caches. Walnut dispersal from feeders to the habitats was monitored by radiotracking and camera traps. A sowing experiment simulating natural caches tested the effect of caching type on seed germination and seedling emergence. Seed mass was controlled for the dispersal and sowing experiments. Magpies selected the two habitats with soft soil, and avoided the one with compacted soil, to cache nuts. Seed mass did not affect dispersal distance, germination or emergence; however, heavier seeds were cached more often under litter and in the habitat with herbaceous cover, whereas lighter seeds were more often buried in the soft bare soil habitat. Seed burial under soil or litter determined seed fate, as there was virtually no emergence from unburied nuts. There was no evidence of any effect of the visual landmarks. Synthesis. The consequences of seed caching for seedling early establishment are driven by a fine decision-making process of the disperser. Magpies seemed to ponder the characteristics of the habitat and the seed itself to determine where and how to cache each nut. By doing so, magpies reinforced the quality of seed dispersal effectiveness, as they cached walnuts in locations that enhanced both seed survival and seedling emergence.",cache; camera trap; Eurasian magpie (Pica pica); radiotracking; seed dispersal; seedling emergence; walnut (Juglans regia),2023,111,2,10.1111/1365-2745.14004,0022-0477,20,151,322,2069,7,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,On the early warning signal of degradation in drylands: Patches or plants?,"Global drylands are threatened by grazing pressure intensification and climate change, which act as major drivers of land degradation. Detecting this process at an early stage is essential for predicting losses of ecological functions and for restoration management. Vegetation patch-size distribution is an indicator of dryland multifunctionality and has been proposed as a warning signal for the onset of degradation processes. However, we proposed and tested a general model that stresses that patchiness may fail to detect degradation of the forage provision, depending on plant community species composition. This is a key aspect since forage provision is strongly associated with human well-being in drylands. We hypothesized that grazing-induced changes in patchiness and forage provision converge in drylands dominated by forage species but are decoupled in those dominated or co-dominated by non-forage species. We tested the conceptual model in a unique regional-scale gradient with strong ecological differences but a common biogeographical and human impact history to reduce local contingencies effects. We compared datasets of grazing intensification impacts on (i) plant cover and patch-size distribution and (ii) plant density and plant-size distribution of dominant forage grasses (a proxy of forage provisioning). We showed that there is a decoupling between grazing-induced changes in vegetation patchiness and forage provisioning, particularly in drylands where non-forage species are dominant. In these drylands, plant cover and patch-size distribution were slightly affected by grazing intensification, whereas plant density of forage species was decimated and their plant-size distributions were strongly skewed towards small sizes. Synthesis. Our dryland conceptual model suggests that global change impacts on forage species populations can be detected even before changes in patch-size distribution and plant cover. Our findings support the model and indicate that the population status (plant density and plant-size distribution) of forage species allows for predicting forage dynamics and is useful to the early detection of losses of ecosystem services linked to human well-being in drylands.",climate change; dryland degradation; forage species; grasses; grazing intensification; plant-size distribution; population ecology; vegetation patchiness,2023,111,2,10.1111/1365-2745.14034,0022-0477,12,74,313,2220,8,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Plant diversity effects on herbivory are related to soil biodiversity and plant chemistry,"1. Insect herbivory is a key process in ecosystem functioning. While theory predicts that plant diversity modulates herbivory, the mechanistic links remain unclear. We postulated that the plant metabolome mechanistically links plant diversity and herbivory. 2. In late summer and in spring, we assessed individual plant above-ground herbivory rates and metabolomes of seven plant species in experimental plant communities varying in plant species diversity and resource acquisition strategies. In the same communities, we also measured plant individual biomass as well as soil microbial and nematode community composition. 3. Herbivory rates decreased with increasing plant species richness. Path modelling revealed that plant species richness and community resource acquisition strategy correlated with soil community composition. In particular, changes in nematode community composition were related to plant metabolome composition and thereby herbivory rates. 4. Synthesis. These results suggest that soil community composition plays an important role in reducing herbivory rates with increasing plant diversity by changing plant metabolomes.",above-ground-below-ground interactions; biodiversity-ecosystem function; chemical diversity; eco-metabolomics; herbivory; Jena experiment; metabolite profile,2023,111,2,10.1111/1365-2745.14032,0022-0477,13,89,155,1145,7,NA,350,NA,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Plant species biogeographic origin shapes their current and future distribution on the world's highest island mountain,"In New Guinea, low elevations are thought to be dominated by plant species with biogeographic origins in Sunda (Borneo, Sumatra, Java, Mainland Asia) and high elevations by species from Sahul (Australia and New Guinea). In regions where frequent surveys of the flora are unfeasible, herbarium specimens collected over time offer an opportunity to study the co-occurrence of species. Over 7000 collections have been made on New Guinea's Mount Jaya allowing us to examine species presence under current and future temperatures. Applying a Bayesian phylogenetic mixed effects model to the Mount Jaya elevation gradient, we show that species of Sunda origin are more likely to occupy warmer lowlands and Sahul species cooler higher elevations. Using the model to predict species distributions under a 2 degrees C increase, we find that Sahul species are less likely to tolerate future temperatures, especially below 1000 m. Predictions also show a potential increase in species richness across the gradient. It is unclear if these increases are possible due to limits imposed by the species area relationship. Synthesis. These results emphasise how biogeographic origin influences current and future species distributions on tropical mountains.

JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"Taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity peaks do not coincide along a compositional gradient in forest-grassland mosaics","Ecosystems with forest and grassland patches as alternative stable states usually contain various closed, semi-open and open habitats, which may be aligned along a vegetation cover gradient. Taxonomic diversity usually peaks near the middle of the gradient, but our knowledge on functional and phylogenetic diversity trends along gradients is more limited. We investigated the eight main habitats of Hungarian forest-grassland mosaics, representing various vegetation cover values, and compared their species composition as well as their taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity. We found a compositional gradient ranging from large forest patches through smaller-sized forest patches and edges to closed and open grasslands. Species richness peaked at the middle of the gradient (at edges). Shannon diversity was high near the middle and at the open end of the gradient. Functional diversity was high throughout woody habitats (in forests and at edges) and was significantly lower in grasslands. When considering all species, phylogenetic diversity tended to peak at north-facing forest edges. When excluding non-angiosperms, this peak disappeared. The high taxonomic diversity at the middle of the gradient is in line with the edge-effect theory. Our results suggest that community assembly in grasslands may be dominated by environmental filtering, while competition may be decisive in woody habitats. The low phylogenetic diversity of grassland habitats can be explained by their young evolutionary age compared to forests. Synthesis. Functional and phylogenetic diversity do not necessarily coincide with taxonomic diversity along vegetation cover gradients. In ecosystems where forest and grassland patches represent alternative stable states, the trends of taxonomic diversity may be similar to those revealed here, but functional diversity patterns may be more system-specific for some traits.

JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Prolonged Light Deprivation Modulates the Age-Related Changes in alpha-Tocopherol Level in Rats,"The light-dark cycle is one of the main environmental factors affecting the rhythm of biological processes in the body. A change or absence of this cyclicity leads to disruption of circadian rhythms and negatively affects the functioning of all body systems. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of constant darkness, which began from the prenatal period (DD/DD) or from the moment of birth (LD/DD) and continued throughout life, on the content of alpha-tocopherol in Wistar rats in late ontogenesis (3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months). Control animals were kept under standard light conditions (LD). The level of alpha-tocopherol was determined by HPLC. The modulating effect of long-term light deprivation was found in the liver, skeletal muscle and lungs, most of the changes were observed in 12-month-old rats. Thus, in the liver the level of vitamin decreased in both experimental groups, which is probably due to the regulatory role of the organ in maintaining vitamin E homeostasis in the body. In the skeletal muscle of rats from the DD/DD group, a significant increase in the content of alpha-tocopherol was found. This may show the accumulation of lipids in myocytes as a result of disorder of homeostasis of the main energy substrates of skeletal muscles. In 24-month-old rats of this group, the vitamin level in the tissue was significantly lower than in the control, which may indicate a decrease in the antioxidant protection of the skeletal muscle due to age-related changes. In rats, exposed to constant darkness after birth, there were differences in the direction of changes in the lungs alpha-tocopherol level compared with the control group at the age of 6 and 12 months. In aging and old animals, the effect of light deprivation was probably smoothed out by age-related disturbances of the circadian system thus in most of the studied tissues the vitamin content did not differ in rats of the control and both experimental groups. The results can be useful in assessing the physiological state of people working or living under poor lighting conditions.",alpha-tocopherol; aging; light deprivation; postnatal ontogeny; Wistar rats,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050271,0022-0930,12,95,340,2081,5,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Early Functional Changes in Rat Arteries and Microcirculatory Vessels while Modeling Metabolic Syndrome,"Early changes in the cardiovascular system of young Wistar rats were studied in modeling metabolic syndrome by a fructose load. It was found that despite some weight loss in rats fed a fructose diet, as compared to control animals, these animals showed the signs of metabolic syndrome: hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system, arterial hypertension. Changes in the mesenteric arteries included an increase in the reactivity to phenylephrine and a decrease in acetylcholine-induced dilation due to decreased NO production by the endothelium, which is to a certain extent compensated by an increased production of the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor realizing its effects through the activation of intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+-channels. Fructose load led to the inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase in arterial smooth muscle cells. In the skin microcirculatory bed of fructose-loaded rats, perfusion remained at the level typical for control animals, while skin microvessels showed an increase in neurogenic tone and an attenuation of endothelium-dependent tone. A decreased endothelial NO production was found in microcirculatory vessels, which was compensated by the synthesis of other endothelium-derived vasodilating factors.",metabolic syndrome; laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF); endothelial dysfunction; fructose load,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050179,0022-0930,13,103,181,1317,4,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Mechanisms of Physiological and Neurotoxic Action of Hyperbaric Oxygen,"During the period of use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) in medical treatment and in scuba diving, extensive knowledge has been accumulated about the mechanisms of its biological action. In the present work, we analyze the experimental data of recent years related to the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the physiological and neurotoxic effects of hyperbaric oxygen. New data on the physiological action of HBO2 concern the mechanisms of hyperoxic vasoconstriction and baroreflex activation in hyperoxia. The toxic effect of hyperbaric oxygen is realized through the intensive production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which cause post-translational modification of proteins responsible for neuronal electrogenesis and synaptic transmission in the GABAergic system of the brain.",hyperbaric oxygen; reactive oxygen and nitrogen species; hyperoxic vasoconstriction; hyperoxic baroreflex; oxygen convulsions; brain GABAergic system,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050246,0022-0930,9,70,113,789,6,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Effects of Ni2+ on Heart and Respiratory Rhythms in Newborn Rats,"The effect of Ni2+, a T-type low-threshold calcium channel (T-VDCC) and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) blocker, on cardiac and respiratory rhythm parameters was studied in newborn rats aged 3-16 days (P3-16). A distinct age dependence of the intensity of the arrhythmogenic effect evoked by calcium channel blockade was found. In 3-day-old rats injected with NiCl2 at a dose of 109 mg/kg (ED100), a transient atypical heart rhythm, representing the alternating periods of moderate bradycardia with a pathologically slow (up to 20-60 bpm) heart rhythm, occurs in 100\% of animals. In parallel, a pronounced respiratory system dysfunction with burst breathing develops. This symptom complex occurs in 75\% of 10-14-day-old rats and is completely absent in 15-16-day-old animals. Phenomenologically similar heart rhythm disorders are observed in newborn rats after NiCl2 injection, during poisoning with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and upon activation of the central N-cholinergic structures. The obtained data suggest that in the early period of rat postnatal ontogenesis, impaired mechanisms of calcium metabolism may play a certain role in the development of arrhythmogenic disorders.",newborn rats; dysrhythmia; heart rate; respiration; calcium channels; nickel chloride,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050088,0022-0930,11,64,170,1183,6,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,"Comparative Study of the Behavior of Wistar Rats, Dopamine Transporter Heterozygous Rats and Rats after Long-Term Ethanol Consumption in the Morris Water Maze","Dysfunctions of the dopaminergic system are the basis of many neuropsychiatric diseases. A promising model for research is a model of moderate increase in DA system activity: DAT-HET rats heterozygous for the dopamine transporter gene knockout. They are characterized by higher motor activity and cognitive impairments, which allow them to be considered as a possible model of pathologies such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is known that chronic ethanol consumption leads to dopamine depletion, particularly in the striatum. We suggest that chronically ethanol-consuming rats may serve as a model of moderate hypodopaminergic state, as opposed to DAT-HET rats. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of such modulations of the dopaminergic system on learning and spatial navigation in the Morris water maze. A decrease in dopamine levels compared to DAT-HET rats was found only in rats with a higher level of ethanol preference. In the Morris water maze, the DAT-HET rats showed an unproductive strategy of thigmotaxis significantly more than the ethanol-consuming rats, which led to slower learning. It is possible that the observed impairments in the learning of the spatial task are related to their stress vulnerability, manifested, in particular, by a high level of defecation in the pool. Rats after the chronic ethanol exposure demonstrated a delayed purposeful search for a platform in comparison with the control group, which was expressed in less time spent in the target sector at the beginning of each learning session. The study allows us to conclude that the moderate multidirectional modulation of the activity of the dopaminergic system does not lead to the pronounced impairment in spatial navigation in the Morris water maze, but reduces cognitive flexibility evidenced by longer periods of using unproductive strategies.",dopamine transporter heterozygous rats; Morris water maze; chronic ethanol consumption,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050337,0022-0930,23,158,287,1866,3,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,An Experimental Study of the Neuroprotective Effect of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter Type 2 Inhibitors,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have proven cardioprotective properties, which makes this class of drugs one of the priorities in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Ischemic stroke and chronic cerebral dyscirculation occur with high frequency in DM2, thus actualizing a study of SGLT2i neurotropic properties. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the neuroprotective effects of the highly selective SGLT2i empagliflozin (EMPA) and low-selective SGLT2i canagliflozin (CANA) on the rat model of acute cerebral ischemia, as well as investigate the probable mechanism of these effects on the brain. At the first stage, EMPA and CANA were administered to Wistar rats without DM2 for 7 days prior to transient focal 30-min cerebral ischemia modeling. After 48 h of reperfusion, neurological deficit was assessed by Garcia scores, and brain sections were then incubated in a triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution to evaluate the brain damage volume. The latter did not differ in EMPA and CANA groups and was significantly smaller compared to the control group of untreated rats. At the same time, neither EMPA nor CANA had a significant effect on neurological deficit. At the second stage, we modeled DM2 (high-fat diet and streptozotocin + nicotinamide), and 4 weeks later, 8-week EMPA and CANA therapy was initiated. After the end of therapy, brain tissue was studied immunohistochemically. DM2 development was accompanied by an increase in the number of microgliocytes in the hippocampal CA1 area; the therapy with EMPA, but not CANA, led to a decrease in the number of activated microgliocytes. Thus, the highly selective SGLT-2i EMPA and low-selective SGLT-2i CANA exert a similar infarct-limiting effect when applied for 7 days prior to ischemia modeling in Wistar rats without DM2. The neuroprotective effect of EMPA in DM2 may in part be due to a decrease in microglial activation.",diabetes mellitus; neuroprotection; brain ischemia; sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor; microglia,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050234,0022-0930,13,101,303,1947,5,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Myocardial Infarct-Size Limiting Effect of Postconditioning with L-Lactate in Young and Old Rats under Atropine-Induced Blockade of M-Cholinoreceptors,"Ischemic injury is one of the most adverse pathogenic factors that evoke irreversible changes in organs and tissues. Cardioprotection from ischemia-reperfusion injury is an important challenge for modern experimental and clinical medicine. This type of injury is a key link in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease and, above all, acute myocardial infarction, a socioeconomically significant disease that is one of the main causes of disability and mortality among the adult population. The aim of the study was to elucidate the infarct-size limiting effect of postconditioning (Post) with L-lactate during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in young and old rats under atropine-induced blockade of M-cholinergic receptors. In experiments on rats, it was found that Post with L-lactate has an infarct-size limiting effect during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in both young and old animals, however, under conditions of systemic atropine administration (2 mg/kg), this effect was persistent in old rats only. Apparently, the activity of the peripheral M-cholinergic systems is of importance for the implementation mechanisms of the cardioprotective effects of Post with L-lactate in young, but not old rats.",cardioprotection; L-lactate; myocardium; ischemia; reperfusion; atropine; M-cholinergic systems,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050040,0022-0930,18,150,174,1210,7,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Imbalance of Hormones Involved in Energy Balance Regulation in Obese Patients: a Study of Its Relationship with Disturbed Eating Behavior and Abnormal Metabolic Parameters,"In healthy people, postprandial status is characterized by a particular dynamics of the level of hormones involved in the regulation of eating behavior and energy balance. However, data obtained from obese patients are heterogeneous. The aim of this work was to study the pattern of dynamic changes in the level of hormones-leptin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP)-and to elucidate their relationship with factors characterizing metabolic status and eating behavior. Sixty six obese patients (12 men and 54 women, mean age 37.8 +/- 10.8 years, mean body weight 105.2 +/- 16.7 kg, body mass index (BMI) 37.3 +/- 4.8 kg/m(2)) were included in the study. All patients underwent anthropometric examination and had their blood pressure, as well as parameters of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, determined. Hormone levels (leptin, GIP, GLP-1, ghrelin) were assessed fasting and 60 min after a standard breakfast containing 60 g of carbohydrates. It was found that different obese patients demonstrated multidirectional changes in the study hormone levels. Some patients retained the dynamics typical for healthy people, while the majority exhibited a decrease in postprandial peaks (GLP-1 in 48.2\%, GIP in 50\% of patients), or an abnormal dynamics (no decrease in postprandial ghrelin levels in 60.8\%, no increase in postprandial leptin levels in 83.3\%). The abnormal postprandial dynamics of hormone levels was associated with more pronounced changes in parameters corresponding to the metabolically unhealthy obesity (elevated glucose and triglyceride levels, increased HOMA-IR index) and disturbed eating behavior. The postprandial dynamics of hormones involved in the regulation of appetite and energy balance suggests the presence of different subtypes of obesity. Those subtypes, which probably reflect the resistance to these hormones and/or their deficiency developing in obesity, are characterized by the worse characteristics of metabolic health.",leptin resistance; ghrelin resistance; glucagon-like peptide 1; glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide; obesity; eating behaviour,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050192,0022-0930,24,171,290,2013,6,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes

We have shown for the first time the presence of mTOR-immunopositive (ip) neurons in the arcuate (ARN), dorsomedial (DMN), and ventromedial (VMN) hypothalamic nuclei, as well as RICTOR-ip neurons in the ARN and VMN in rats of different ages. In the ARN of aging rats, the percentage of mTOR-ip neurons increases, while the proportion of mTOR-ip neurons colocalizing mTOR and RICTOR decreases. In the VMN and DMN, a highest percentage of mTOR-ip neurons was observed in 6-month-old rats. A highest percentage of RICTOR-ip neurons was found in the VMN of 6-month-old rats.

JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Voluntary Movements Performance during the Involuntary Attention Activation,"The present experiment was aimed to study the influence of automatic change detection and attention switching processes on event related potentials associated with the preparation of voluntary movement. Participants performed self-initiated key presses with their right hand index finger simultaneously with listening to sound stimuli presented in two sequences: the oddball paradigm and the control paradigm. Participants were asked to focus on the motor task and ignore the sound stimuli. The oddball paradigm is a sequence of repetitive (standard) and deviant tones, which leads to the involuntary attention activation. The distribution analysis of the number of movements relative to the time of sound stimulus presentation showed that in the oddball paradigm, the number of pressings performed in the interval of 800-1200 ms after the stimulus was significantly greater compared to the interval of stimulus presentation (0-400 ms). When analyzing the readiness potential amplitude, a significant increase of the bilaterally symmetrical component in the interval from -300 to -600 ms before the movement was found in the oddball paradigm compared to the control paradigm. The results obtained allow us to speak about the activating effect of the processes associated with the involuntary attention system on the early components of movement preparation.",readiness potential; bereitschaftspotential; voluntary movements; mismatch negativity; involuntary attention; oddball paradigm,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050283,0022-0930,8,75,200,1357,6,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Rutin Ameliorates H2O2-Induced Oxidative Stress Injury in HaCaT Cells via the Nrf2-Regulated Pathway,"Oxidative stress induced by harmful substances activates inflammatory signaling pathways and causes excessive proliferation of keratinocytes, which is related to the occurrence of psoriasis. Rutin, a natural citrus flavonoid glycoside, exhibits protective effects against oxidative stress. However, whether rutin is able to influence oxidative stress in keratinocytes remains unclear. In the present study, an in vitro cell model of human keratinocytes (HaCaT) treated with H2O2 was used to explore whether rutin can prevent oxidative stress. The present findings suggest that rutin protected HaCaT cells against oxidative damage by inhibiting ROS, NO and MDA secretion, increasing SOD activity and restoring GSH-Px activity. In addition, rutin supplement limited IL-6, IL-1 beta and IL-23A production in HaCaT cells. Moreover, rutin upregulated Nrf2 expression, and promoted the downstream NQO1 and HO-1 expression. These results suggest that rutin may inhibit HaCaT cell oxidative stress by modulating the Nrf2-regulated pathway.",oxidative stress; rutin; HaCaT cells; psoriasis; Nrf2-regulated pathway,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050106,0022-0930,13,100,144,1031,5,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,miR-338-3p Inhibits Apoptosis Evasion in Huh7 Liver Cancer Cells by Targeting Sirtuin 6,"Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers with an unsatisfactory prognosis and high mortality rate. The ability of liver cancer cells to evade apoptosis results in the poor therapeutic effect of existing treatments and high rates of tumor recurrence and metastasis. This study investigated the effects of abnormal miR-338-3p expression on the ability of liver cancer cells to avoid apoptosis and the mechanism for that avoidance. The levels of miR-338-3p in liver tumor tissues and in different liver cancer cell lines were analysed by qRT-PCR which demonstrated its downregulation in liver tumor tissues and cells, especially in the Huh7 cells. Cell viability and apoptosis rates of Huh7 liver cancer cells were evaluated using the CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, flow cytometry, and TUNEL assay. whereas the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins (Bax, caspase-3, Cyt C, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein {[}XIAP]) were analyzed by Western blotting. Next, the target relationship between miR-338-3p and Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) was identified by conducting a dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Overexpression of miR-338-3p was found to inhibit cell viability and promote the apoptosis of Huh7 cells. Additionally, an upregulation of miR-338-3p significantly promoted Bax, caspase-3, and Cyt C expression, and suppressed XIAP and SIRT6 expression. Notably, SIRT6 was proven to be a target gene of miR-338-3p, and SIRT6 overexpression was shown to reverse the anti-tumor effect of miR-338-3p upregulation in Huh7 cells. Furthermore, the apoptosis induction effect of Cisplatin was reduced by SIRT6, but restored by miR-338-3p. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that miR-338-3p increased apoptosis in liver cancer cell Huh7 by inhibiting SIRT6, and thereby enhanced the cytocidal effect of the apoptosis inducer Cisplatin. These results suggest miR-338-3p as a target for treating liver cancer, which might provide a new therapeutic strategy.",liver cancer; miR-338-3p; apoptosis evasion; Sirtuin 6,2022,58,5,10.1134/S002209302205012X,0022-0930,13,87,292,1969,4,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Involvement of Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase in Pial Arterial Tone Formation under Metabolic Disorders and Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetes in Rats Kept on a High-Fat Diet,"Changes in acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated dilation of the pial arteries in the sensorimotor cortex were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats after the formation of metabolic and hormonal disorders similar to those in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). For this purpose, the rats were kept on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 2 months, and then some of them were injected with a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 35 mg/kg). Next, all animals were again receiving high-fat foods for another one month (a total of a 3-month HFD). The responses of pial arteries to the effects of acetylcholie (ACh, 10(-7) M) alone or against the background of L-NAME, a non-selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) blocker, or aminoguanidine (AG), a selective inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) blocker, were assessed using intravital microscopy imaging technique. It was found that a 3-month HFD led to the development of endothelial dysfunction in the pial arteries of the sensorimotor cortex: the number of vessels dilated to the effect of ACh in the HFD group was 1.2-1.6 times smaller compared to the control group. ACh-mediated vascular dilation was endothelial NOS (eNOS)-depended only in the arteries with a caliber < 40 mu m. In HFD rats, iNOS was not detected in the cerebral arteries. Animals with an STZ-induced DM2 model also developed endothelial dysfunction in the cerebral arteries: the number of vessels dilated to the effect of ACh in the DM2 group was 1.6-2.3 times smaller compared to the control group. In DM2 rats, the eNOS-associated signaling cascade did not control arterial reactivity, and vascular tone was mainly sustained due to iNOS-mediated reactions. In DM2 rats, the major abnormalities in the vascular dilatory response included the least number of vessels dilated in response to ACh alone with a significant decrease in the degree of dilation (by 1.5-1.6 times vs control), persistent ACh-mediated vascular dilation despite the presence of L-NAME, and the largest number of vascular constrictions in response to AG (60-70\% of all the vessels examined). All these disorders were revealed in the pial arteries with a caliber < 40 mu m, i.e. exactly in the vasculature segment that is maximally involved in blood-tissue gas exchange.",high-fat diet; type 2 diabetes mellitus; pial vessels; endothelial dysfunction; eNOS; iNOS; acetylcholine; dilatation,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050180,0022-0930,24,172,355,2228,8,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Effects of Nephrectomy on the Electrical Field Stimulation-Evoked Changes in Tone of Arteries from the Normotensive and Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats,"The effects of nephrectomy on the electrical field stimulation-evoked changes in tone of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) segments were studied. The hypothesis that chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to an increase in neurogenic vascular tone in both normal and hypertensive animals was tested. 5/6 nephrectomy in the rats was used as a model of CKD. Neurogenic constriction of the segments was induced by the electrical field stimulation of the perivascular nerves in the absence and presence of potassium channels blockers (tetraethylammonium, glibenclamide) or methylene blue, a guanylyl-cyclase inhibitor. In the absence of blockers, nephrectomy was found to increase neurogenic contraction only in SMA from WKY. In addition, in SMA, this effect of nephrectomy was manifested in the presence of glibenclamide. In the presence of blockers, the neurogenic response of the SMA from SHR did not depend on nephrectomy, while in ICA from nephrectomized rats under these conditions, neurogenic constriction in WKY and dilatation in SHR was more significant than in control animals. Nephrectomy-related increase in artery constriction in WKY was also evoked by phenylephrine in SMA and tetraethylammonium in ICA, while in SHR, nephrectomy led to a decrease in ICA constriction evoked by phenylephrine and tetraethylammonium. The data obtained suggest that CKD may lead to an increase in neurogenic and chemical-induced vascular tone in normotensive animals and to its decrease in initially hypertensive animals. To the greatest extent, these changes can be expressed in the ICA and are associated with an increase in the activity of potassium channels and guanylyl-cyclase in this artery in CKD in initially normotensive animals and with a decrease in this activity in initially hypertensive animals.",internal carotid artery; neurogenic constriction; nephrectomy; superior mesenteric artery; SHR; WKY,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050301,0022-0930,20,151,282,1890,6,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes

New data in human and animal models suggest an intriguing relationship between endoplasmic reticulum stress, depression and inflammation. Under cellular stress, the number of protein folding disorders increases, which leads to the development of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). The ERS, in turn, activates the ``unfolded protein response{''} system (unfolded protein response, UPR), the IRE1-XBP1 signaling system is very important. The transcription factor XBP1 is responsible for regulating the expression of a large number of genes involved in the proper folding and maturation of proteins, the degradation of misfolded proteins and regulation of immune responses.

It was found that in fall, at positive daytime temperatures, the circadian rhythm of body temperature is absent in Far Eastern forest cats and weakly expressed in domestic cats. However, it reappears during the period of winter cold in the form of fluctuations, synchronous in all animals, with an amplitude of 3-4 degrees C and acrophase in the middle of the daylight period and a minimum in the middle of the night. For comparison, the recording of the ``core{'' body temperature and activity in two female domestic cats kept in the same season in the laboratory revealed no comparable rhythms.

JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Effect of Systemic Hypothermia on Reactions of Pial Arteries to Acute Massive Blood Loss in Anesthetized Rats,"The effect of the lowering of body temperature on the responses of cerebral arteries was studied in anesthetized (urethane, 1000 mg/kg) male Wistar rats in conditions of hemodynamic stability and after pre-induced acute massive blood loss. Changes in the diameter of the pial arteries (initial diameter 10-40 mu m) were evaluated via intravital microscopy in four experimental groups: without and with pre-induced blood loss (35\% of the circulating blood volume), and in each group, at room temperature (22-23 degrees C) and during gradually developing cold-water immersion hypothermia (12-13 degrees C) until respiratory arrest. In the groups with pre-induced blood loss, respiratory arrest came about at room temperature after an average of 3 h with a decrease in body temperature to 32.4 +/- 0.5 degrees C, while during immersion cooling, it occurred after 2.5 h at 15.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C. In the groups without blood loss, respiratory arrest did not come about at room temperature for more than 3.5 h of observation, although rectal temperature decreased to 34.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C; during immersion cooling, respiratory arrest was observed after 3 h at a body temperature of 13.1 +/- 0.3 degrees C. During the lowering of body temperature, the rats of all experimental groups showed vasoconstriction. In the groups with blood loss, the reduction in the diameter of the pial vessels accounted for 10-15\% of the initial immediately after blood withdrawal and more than 30\% of that during subsequent immersion cooling. In rats without blood loss, the constriction of pial arteries during immersion cooling was significantly less. Thus, systemic hypothermia aggravates microcirculatory dysfunction induced by acute massive blood loss, suggesting an additive effect of hypothermia and hemorrhage on vasoconstrictor responses of the pial arteries in rats.",immersion hypothermia; acute blood loss; pial artery; rat; rectal temperature; vasoconstriction; intravital microscopy,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050039,0022-0930,17,109,286,1856,7,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,Correction of Behavioral Disorders and State of Microglia with Recombinant IL-1 Receptor Antagonist in Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a multifactorial disease that can lead to the development of neurological diseases. To correct violations of physiological functions, anti-inflammatory cytokines are used, in particular, the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the rIL-1RA preparation for the correction of post-traumatic neuroinflammation. TBI in rats was simulated by dropping a 115 g weight from a height of 120 cm into the center of the parietal region, and the drug was injected subcutaneously at a dose of 50 mg/kg 60 min after injury. We studied blood corticosterone levels and behavioral responses in the ``Open field{'' test. To characterize the activation pattern of microglia in different parts of the brain, the expression of the Iba1 marker and morphological changes of cells were evaluated. Counting the total number and changing the shape and size of Iba1-positive microglial cells on 7th day after TBI showed that in animals treated with rIL-1RA the number of activated microglial cells was significantly higher than in intact animals, but the degree of their activation was significantly lower. Studies of CNS function disorders after TBI showed that motor and orientation-exploratory activities were significantly inhibited, which, together with the disturbance of the emotional status of the animals, indicates the development of a neurological deficit in intact rats. In animals treated with rIL-1RA, changes in behavioral characteristics were less pronounced. The decrease in neurological deficit in treated animals was directly related to the normalization of the state of microglia. The data obtained in the work indicate that the use of rIL-1RA 1 h after TBI allows correction of motor, orientation-exploratory activity and reduce microglia activation in different parts of the CNS.",TBI; corticosterone; rIL-1RA; behavior; microglia,2022,58,5,10.1134/S0022093022050258,0022-0930,18,138,282,1860,5,NA,250,7,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Effect of population size and selection on Toll-like receptor diversity in populations of Galapagos mockingbirds,"The interactions of evolutionary forces are difficult to analyse in free-living populations. However, when properly understood, they provide valuable insights into evolutionary biology and conservation genetics. This is particularly important for the interplay of genetic drift and natural selection in immune genes that confer resistance to disease. The Galapagos Islands are inhabited by four closely related species of mockingbirds (Mimus spp.). We used 12 different-sized populations of Galapagos mockingbirds and one population of their continental relative northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) to study the effects of genetic drift on the molecular evolution of immune genes, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs: TLR1B, TLR4 and TLR15). We found that neutral genetic diversity was positively correlated with island size, indicating an important effect of genetic drift. However, for TLR1B and TLR4, there was little correlation between functional (e.g., protein) diversity and island size, and protein structural properties were largely conserved, indicating only a limited effect of genetic drift on molecular phenotype. By contrast, TLR15 was less conserved and even its putative functional polymorphism correlated with island size. The patterns observed for the three genes suggest that genetic drift does not necessarily dominate selection even in relatively small populations, but that the final outcome depends on the degree of selection constraint that is specific for each TLR locus.",conservation genetics; innate immunity; island birds; molecular phenotype; purifying selection,2023,36,1,10.1111/jeb.14121,1010-061X,15,112,212,1495,5,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Genetic architecture of multiple mutualisms and mating system in Turnera ulmifolia,"Plants often associate with multiple arthropod mutualists. These partners provide important services to their hosts, but multiple interactions can constrain a plant's ability to respond to complex, multivariate selection. Here, we quantified patterns of genetic variance and covariance among rewards for pollination, biotic defence and seed dispersal mutualisms in multiple populations of Turnera ulmifolia to better understand how the genetic architecture of multiple mutualisms might influence their evolution. We phenotyped plants cultivated from 17 Jamaican populations for several mutualism and mating system-related traits. We then fit genetic variance-covariance (G) matrices for the island metapopulation and the five largest individual populations. At the metapopulation level, we observed significant positive genetic correlations among stigma-anther separation, floral nectar production and extrafloral nectar production. These correlations have the potential to significantly constrain or facilitate the evolution of multiple mutualisms in T. ulmifolia and suggest that pollination, seed dispersal and dispersal mutualisms do not evolve independently. In particular, we found that positive genetic correlations between floral and extrafloral nectar production may help explain their stable coexistence in the face of physiological trade-offs and negative interactions between pollinators and ant bodyguards. Locally, we found only small differences in G among our T. ulmifolia populations, suggesting that geographic variation in G may not shape the evolution of multiple mutualisms.",biotic defence; G matrix; multiple mutualisms; pollination; seed dispersal,2023,36,1,10.1111/jeb.14098,1010-061X,11,82,212,1595,5,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Interpopulation variation in inbreeding is primarily driven by tolerance of mating with relatives in a spermcasting invertebrate,"The degree to which individuals inbreed is a fundamental aspect of population biology shaped by both passive and active processes. Yet, the relative influences of random and non-random mating on the overall magnitude of inbreeding are not well characterized for many taxa. We quantified variation in inbreeding among qualitatively accessible and isolated populations of a sessile marine invertebrate (the colonial ascidian Lissoclinum verrilli) in which hermaphroditic colonies cast sperm into the water column for subsequent uptake and internal fertilization. We compared estimates of inbreeding to simulations predicting random mating within sites to evaluate if levels of inbreeding were (1) less than expected because of active attempts to limit inbreeding, (2) as predicted by genetic subdivision and passive inbreeding tolerance, or (3) greater than simulations due to active attempts to promote inbreeding via self-fertilization or a preference for related mates. We found evidence of restricted gene flow and significant differences in the genetic diversity of L. verrilli colonies among sites, indicating that on average colonies were weakly related in accessible locations, but their levels of relatedness matched that of first cousins or half-siblings on isolated substrates. Irrespective of population size, progeny arrays revealed variation in the magnitude of inbreeding across sites that tracked with the mean relatedness of conspecifics. Biparental reproduction was confirmed in most offspring (86\%) and estimates of total inbreeding largely overlapped with simulations of random mating, suggesting that interpopulation variation in mother-offspring resemblance was primarily due to genetic subdivision and passive tolerance of related mates. Our results highlight the influence of demographic isolation on the genetic composition of populations, and support theory predicting that tolerance of biparental inbreeding, even when mates are closely related, may be favoured under a broad set of ecological and evolutionary conditions.",biparental inbreeding; inbreeding tolerance; marine invertebrate; philopatry,2023,36,1,10.1111/jeb.14125,1010-061X,17,128,288,2048,4,NA,250,10,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Intraspecific variation in reproductive barriers between two closely related Arabidopsis sister species,"Reproductive isolation (RI) is a critical component of speciation and varies strongly in timing and strength among different sister taxa, depending on, for example the geography of speciation and divergence time. However, these factors may also produce variation in timing and strength among populations within species. Here we tested for variation in the expression of RI among replicate population pairs between the sister taxa Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata and A. arenicola. While the former is predominantly outcrossing, the latter is predominantly selfing. We focused on intrinsic prezygotic and postzygotic RI as both species occur largely in allopatry. We assessed RI by performing within-population crosses and interspecific between-population crosses, and by raising offspring. RI was generally high between all interspecific population pairs, but it varied in timing and strength depending on population history. Prezygotic isolation was strongest between the closest-related population pair, while early postzygotic isolation was high for all other population pairs. Furthermore, the timing and strength of RI depended strongly on cross direction. Our study provides empirical support that reproductive barriers between species are highly variable among population pairs and asymmetric within population pairs, and this variation seems to follow patterns typically described across species pairs.",Arabidopsis; genetic distance; reproductive barrier; speciation; variation in reproductive isolation,2023,36,1,10.1111/jeb.14122,1010-061X,12,103,197,1410,5,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Investigating signal modalities of aposematism in a poison frog,"Aposematic species combine a conspicuous signal with a secondary defence, the majority of which are studied in the context of a visual signal. While multimodality of the aposematic signal appears to be common in invertebrate species, we know very little about the presence or absence of multimodality in vertebrates. Here, we examine the possibility of multimodality of aposematism in the green-and-black poison frog, Dendrobates auratus. Using a non-visual predator (the cat-eyed snake, Leptodeira annulata) and extractions of chemicals in frog skins, we test whether there is sufficient non-visual information for predators to avoid this aposematic species without using visual cues. We found that experienced predators avoid chemicals in this poison frog's skin by olfactory cues alone in trials with live frogs and extracts from captive poison frogs, whereas extracts from wild poison frogs did not lead to avoidance behaviours in predators. Further, in our limited sampling, naive predators demonstrate no avoidance. This not only indicates that predators can make informed decisions from the frog's odour, but also indicates that avoidance based on olfactory cue is a learned response.",chemical cues; olfaction; predation,2023,36,"7, SI",10.1111/jeb.14111,1010-061X,9,63,178,1191,3,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Is drift `directional'? Unequal breeding sex ratio revisited,"Unequal breeding sex ratio can significantly reduce effective population size, allowing a rare neutral allele to jump to a high frequency through genetic drift. However, this one-way alteration to allele frequency appears inconsistent with the concept that drift is non-directional. Based on binomial sampling distribution, this study developed a method to directly and exhaustively measure drift by calculating the mean deviation of change in allele frequency, then applied it to cases of unequal breeding sex ratio. The result shows that, under those cases, (1) the mean deviation can always be divided into two halves that are equal in size but opposite in direction; (2) each half consists of one or several categories represented by various allele proportions in the rare sex; (3) this proportion is another factor that determines the outcome of drift, in addition to effective population size and allele frequency; (4) drift is non-directional on a global scale, but whether an allele will drift up or down can be predicted based on the above factors. This method enables us to dissect every component of the expected change in allele frequency caused by drift and to find out the combined effect of population size, allele frequency and allele proportion in the rarer sex under neutrality but unequal breeding sex ratio.",effective population size; genetic drift; mean deviation; sex ratio,2023,36,2,10.1111/jeb.14113,1010-061X,8,60,211,1327,4,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Oviposition behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster: Genetic and behavioural decoupling between oviposition acceptance and preference for natural fruits,"In phytophagous insects, oviposition behaviour is an important component of habitat selection and, given the multiplicity of genetic and environmental factors affecting its expression, is defined as a complex character resulting from the sum of interdependent traits. Here, we study two components of egg-laying behaviour: oviposition acceptance (OA) and oviposition preference (OP) in Drosophila melanogaster using three natural fruits as resources (grape, tomato and orange) by means of no-choice and two-choice experiments, respectively. This experimental design allowed us to show that the results obtained in two-choice assays (OP) cannot be accounted for by those resulting from no-choice assays (OA). Since the genomes of all lines used are completely sequenced, we perform a genome-wide association study to identify and characterize the genetic underpinnings of these oviposition behaviour traits. The analyses revealed different candidate genes affecting natural genetic variation of both OA and OP traits. Moreover, our results suggest behavioural and genetic decoupling between OA and OP and that egg-laying behaviour is plastic and context-dependent. Such independence in the genetic architectures of OA and OP variation may influence different aspects of oviposition behaviour, including plasticity, canalization, host shift and maintenance of genetic variability, which contributes to the adoption of adaptive strategies during habitat selection.",natural genetic variation; natural resources; oviposition acceptance; oviposition candidate genes; oviposition preference,2023,36,1,10.1111/jeb.14109,1010-061X,17,149,202,1461,5,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection increase offspring quality but impose survival costs to female field crickets,"Whether sexual selection increases or decreases fitness is under ongoing debate. Sexual selection operates before and after mating. Yet, the effects of each episode of selection on individual reproductive success remain largely unexplored. We ask how disentangled pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection contribute to fitness of field crickets Gryllus bimaculatus. Treatments allowed exclusively for (i) pre-copulatory selection, with males fighting and courting one female, and the resulting pair breeding monogamously, (ii) post-copulatory selection, with females mating consecutively to multiple males and (iii) relaxed selection, with enforced pair monogamy. While standardizing the number of matings, we estimated a number of fitness traits across treatments and show that females experiencing sexual selection were more likely to reproduce, their offspring hatched sooner, developed faster and had higher body mass at adulthood, but females suffered survival costs. Interestingly, we found no differences in fitness of females or their offspring from pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection treatments. Our findings highlight the potential for sexual selection in enhancing indirect female fitness while concurrently imposing direct survival costs. By potentially outweighing these costs, increased offspring quality could lead to beneficial population-level consequences of sexual selection.",fitness; Gryllus bimaculatus; pre- and post-copulatory; sexual selection; survival,2023,36,1,10.1111/jeb.14132,1010-061X,16,119,188,1402,5,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Reproductive isolation via divergent genital morphology due to cascade reinforcement in Ohomopterus ground beetles,"Secondary contact between incipient species and selection against maladaptive hybridization can drive reinforcement between populations in contact and result in reproductive character displacement (RCD). Resultant divergence in mating traits within a species may generate downstream reproductive isolation between populations with displaced and non-displaced traits, referred to as the cascade reinforcement hypothesis. We examined this hypothesis using three allopatric populations of the ground beetle Carabus maiyasanus with a genital lock-and-key system. This species shows RCD in male and female genital morphologies in populations in contact with the sister species C. iwawakianus. In a reciprocal mating experiment using three allopatric populations with differences in male and female genital sizes, insemination failure increased as the difference in genital size increased. Based on the reproductive isolation index, insemination failure was the major postmating-prezygotic isolation barrier, at least in one population pair with comparable total isolation to those of other species pairs. By contrast, there was only incomplete premating isolation among populations. These results suggest that RCD in genital morphologies drives incipient allopatric speciation, supporting the cascade reinforcement hypothesis. These findings provide insight into the roles of interspecific interactions and subsequent trait diversification in speciation processes.",Carabus maiyasanus; genitalia; lock-and-key; reproductive character displacement; reproductive interference,2023,36,1,10.1111/jeb.14116,1010-061X,14,114,191,1459,5,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,Sexual selection drives the coevolution of male and female reproductive traits in Peromyscus mice,"When females mate with multiple partners within a single reproductive cycle, sperm from rival males may compete for fertilization of a limited number of ova, and females may bias the fertilization of their ova by particular sperm. Over evolutionary timescales, these two forms of selection shape both male and female reproductive physiology when females mate multiply, yet in monogamous systems, post-copulatory sexual selection is weak or absent. Here, we examine how divergent mating strategies within a genus of closely related mice, Peromyscus, have shaped the evolution of reproductive traits. We show that in promiscuous species, males exhibit traits associated with increased sperm production and sperm swimming performance, and females exhibit traits that are predicted to limit sperm access to their ova including increased oviduct length and a larger cumulus cell mass surrounding the ova, compared to monogamous species. Importantly, we found that across species, oviduct length and cumulus cell density are significantly correlated with sperm velocity, but not sperm count or relative testes size, suggesting that these female traits may have coevolved with increased sperm quality rather than quantity. Taken together, our results highlight how male and female traits evolve in concert and respond to changes in the level of post-copulatory sexual selection.",cryptic female choice; mammals; sexual conflicts; sexual selection; sperm competition,2023,36,1,10.1111/jeb.14126,1010-061X,14,97,203,1371,5,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,"Sociality, ecology and developmental constraints predict variation in brain size across birds","Conflicting theories have been proposed to explain variation in relative brain size across the animal kingdom. Ecological theories argue that the cognitive demands of seasonal or unpredictable environments have selected for increases in relative brain size, whereas the `social brain hypothesis' argues that social complexity is the primary driver of brain size evolution. Here, we use a comparative approach to test the relative importance of ecology (diet, foraging niche and migration), sociality (social bond, cooperative breeding and territoriality) and developmental mode in shaping brain size across 1886 bird species. Across all birds, we find a highly significant effect of developmental mode and foraging niche on brain size, suggesting that developmental constraints and selection for complex motor skills whilst foraging generally imposes important selection on brain size in birds. We also find effects of social bonding and territoriality on brain size, but the direction of these effects do not support the social brain hypothesis. At the same time, we find extensive heterogeneity among major avian clades in the relative importance of different variables, implying that the significance of particular ecological and social factors for driving brain size evolution is often clade- and context-specific. Overall, our results reveal the important and complex ways in which ecological and social selection pressures and developmental constraints shape brain size evolution across birds.",birds; brain; brain size; developmental mode; ecology; sociality,2023,36,1,10.1111/jeb.14117,1010-061X,12,93,217,1499,6,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,To self or not to self? Absence of mate choice despite costly outcrossing in the fungus Podospora anserina,"Fungi have a large potential for flexibility in their mode of sexual reproduction, resulting in mating systems ranging from haploid selfing to outcrossing. However, we know little about which mating strategies are used in nature, and why, even in well-studied model organisms. Here, we explored the fitness consequences of alternative mating strategies in the ascomycete fungus Podospora anserina. We measured and compared fitness proxies of nine genotypes in either diploid selfing or outcrossing events, over two generations, and with or without environmental stress. We showed that fitness was consistently lower in outcrossing events, irrespective of the environment. The cost of outcrossing was partly attributed to non-self recognition genes with pleiotropic effects on fertility. We then predicted that when presented with options to either self or outcross, individuals would perform mate choice in favour of the reproductive strategy that yields higher fitness. Contrary to our prediction, individuals did not seem to avoid outcrossing when a choice was offered, in spite of the fitness cost incurred. Our results suggest that, although functionally diploid, P. anserina does not benefit from outcrossing in most cases. We outline different explanations for the apparent lack of mate choice in face of high fitness costs associated with outcrossing, including a new perspective on the pleiotropic effect of non-self recognition genes.",ascomycetes; fungi; mate choice; mating strategy; outcrossing; Podospora; reproductive strategy; selfing; sexual reproduction,2023,36,1,10.1111/jeb.14108,1010-061X,18,106,213,1443,9,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

This species is part of the Sylvioidea superfamily, where four separate autosome-sex chromosome translocation events have previously been discovered via comparative genomics of 11 of the 22 families in this clade. Our discovery here resulted from analyses of genomic data of single species-representatives from three additional Sylvioidea families (Macrosphenidae, Pycnonotidae and Leiothrichidae). In all three species, we confirmed the translocation of a part of chromosome 4A to the sex chromosomes, which originated basally in Sylvioidea. In S. brachyura, we found that a part of chromosome 8 has been translocated to the sex chromosomes, forming a unique neo-sex chromosome in this lineage. Furthermore, the non-recombining part of 4A in S. brachyura is smaller than in other Sylvioidea species, which suggests that recombination continued along this region after the fusion event in the Sylvioidea ancestor. These findings reveal additional sex chromosome diversity among the Sylvioidea, where five separate translocation events are now confirmed.",birds; genomics; Northern crombec; sex chromosomes; Sylvietta brachyura; Sylvioidea,2022,NA,NA,10.1111/jeb.14096,1010-061X,19,150,169,1186,6,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

To monitor changes in urchin populations, settlement patterns of S. droebachiensis at sites in the northern (Eastport and Frazer Point, ME) and southern Gulf of Maine (York, ME and Isles of Shoals, NH) were recorded. From 1994 to 2019, AstroTurf (R) panels attached to wire frames were intermittently laid on the ocean bottom at five sites along the Gulf of Maine in late spring and retrieved in the mid to late summer. The present study examined changes in recruitment densities over the 23-year period from 1996 to 2019 and found a drop in recruitment at the southern sites by two orders of magnitude over the time span.

Climate change with the associated global changes in warming and acidification could affect the calcification and the shape of otoliths during the crucial larval period in teleost fish. To evaluate this predicted combined effect of temperature and CO2, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) embryos and larvae were reared from hatching to respectively 47 and 60 days post-hatching (dph), under present day conditions and a scenario predicted for the year 2100 (IPCC RCP8.5). Otolith morphogenesis was tracked by analyzing area and normalized Elliptical Fourier coefficients. We found that otolith area for fish of similar size increased under the predicted 2100 climate change scenario compared to the present day. Climate change does not, however, seem to directly affect the otolith shape.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Environmental constraints on the photosynthetic rate of the marine flatworm Symsagittifera roscoffensis,"Symsagittifera roscoffensis, an Acoel flatworm that lives within the intertidal zone, was first discovered over a century ago as a ``plant animal{''} due to its symbiotic relationship with the alga Tetraselmis convolutae. Although commonly used as a model organism in biomedical research, there is little information regarding its life history or how environmental factors affect this organism. In this study, we investigated the effects of a range of abiotic factors on S. roscoffensis by measuring its photosynthetic oxygen production rate under different salinities, temperatures, light intensities, photoperiods, and nutrient concentrations over 6 days. Salinity (20, 30 and 40) had little effect on photosynthetic rate, whereas a temperature of 14 degrees C yielded significantly higher final oxygen production than 0 and 30 degrees C. The lowest light intensity (21 mu mol m- 2 s- 1), the shortest photoperiod (8 L:16 D) and the intermediate nutrient concentration (f/4) resulted in the highest final oxygen production rates. Our results showed that S. roscoffensis had the ability to tolerate and remain photosynthetically active under a wide range of conditions that it is likely to experience within the intertidal zone. Using our experimental data, we estimated that S. roscoffensis was able to produce 174\% body C d-1 via photosynthesis alone, which could explain the total absence of heterotrophic feeding in this organism.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Experimental effects of warming and epiphyte grazing on the ecophysiology of two seagrass morphotypes,"Seagrasses form important ecosystems providing essential provisioning and regulating services. They exhibit acclimative properties to contend with environmental change while intrinsic responses allow seagrasses to persist in sub-and supra-optimal temperatures, and are critical to understanding their ability to cope with a changing climate. An indoor mesocosm approach was used to investigate the effects of warming, i.e. mean summer (24 degrees C) and extreme (30 degrees C) temperatures, and epiphyte grazing on large-leaved and small-leaved morphotypes of a dwarf eelgrass (Zostera capensis) from a temperate lagoon habitat. Both morphotypes displayed similar responses under extreme temperatures with greater losses observed in shoot densities and total biomass compared to summer mean temperatures. However, higher photosynthetic rates and accumulations of carbon, nitrogen and phenolics were observed in small-compared to large-leaved plants. This suggests that small-leaved populations possess a larger propensity to store resources -a potential for resilience. Large-leaved populations appeared to have channelled resources towards growth suggesting a greater susceptibility to stress from e.g. fouling. Epiphyte biomass increased under extreme temperatures and, even though grazing had a positive effect on seagrass biomass under summer mean conditions, grazers did not regulate algal growth under extreme temperatures which may have been too rapid for grazer control. These findings indicate that seagrasses will be negatively affected by extreme warming with ensuing reductions in biomass, increasing their susceptibility to stressors.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Fisheries restrictions and their cascading effects on herbivore abundance and macroalgae removal at Kenyan coral reefs,"The increase of macroalgae at degraded reefs impedes several ecosystem services and calls for effective methods to facilitate a return to coral dominance. Removal of macroalgae (browsing) is typically realized by fish, but the role and identity of browsers at the heavily-fished East African coast is still largely unknown. This study investigated how browsing pressure at Kenyan reefs (-4.700, 39.396) related to fisheries management and herbivore community. From October 2018 to January 2019, consumption during 24-h buffet assays using the brown macroalgae Sargassum and Padina was determined and video recorded at six sites: two in fished zones, two in marine reserves (traditional fishing allowed) and two in no-take zones. Herbivorous fish composition, biomass and sea urchin density were also determined. Consumption of Sargassum and Padina was nearly three-fold lower in the fished zones (26\% and 28\% of macroalgal biomass consumed, respectively) compared to the no-take zones (62\% and 82\%), with intermediate consumption in the marine reserves (48\% and 71\%). Herbivore biomass was seven-fold higher in no-take zones and included substantially more browsers (mainly unicornfishes, Naso spp.) and scrapers (scarids), which were associated with the higher browsing pressure. Browsers and scrapers were predominantly responsible for the consumption of macroalgae as determined by video recordings, though key species differed across sites. In contrast, damselfish-dominated fished sites were associated with high sea urchin densities and low browsing pressure. These results indicate that fishing restrictions are likely to support reef resilience by increasing herbivorous fish biomass of key species and thereby promote macroalgae removal.",Browsers; Padina; Sargassum; Protected area; Grazers; Reef restoration,2023,559,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151850,0022-0981,16,118,250,1752,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,"Ocean acidification modifies behaviour of shelf seabed macrofauna: A laboratory study on two ecosystem engineers, Abra alba and Lanice conchilega","The feeding activity and burrow ventilation by benthic invertebrates importantly affect the biodiversity and functioning of seafloor sediments. Here we investigated how ocean acidification can modify these behavioural activities in two common and abundant macrofaunal ecosystem engineering species in temperate continental shelf communities: the white furrow shell Abra alba and the sand mason Lanice conchilega. Using time-lapse imagery and sediment porewater hydraulic signatures we show that both species adapt their behaviour in response to predicted future pH conditions (-0.3 units). During a three-week laboratory experiment, A. alba reduced the duration per feeding event when suspension and deposit feeding (by 86 and 53\%, respectively), and almost completely ceased suspension feeding under reduced seawater pH in comparison to ambient seawater pH (pH similar to 8.2). This behavioural change reduces the intake of low pH water during feeding and respiration. L. conchilega increased its piston-pumping frequency by 30 and 52\%, respectively, after one and two weeks of exposure to future pH conditions (-0.3 units) relative to ambient conditions. This change in irrigation activity suggests higher metabolic demands under low seawater pH, and also extended low water column pH conditions deeper into the seafloor. Because the distribution of other populations depends on the physicochemical setting by our focal species, we argue that the demonstrated behavioural plasticity will likely have cascading effects on seafloor diversity and functioning, highlighting the complexity of how ocean acidification, and climate change in general, will affect seafloor ecology.",Ocean acidification; Abra alba; Lanice conchilega; Behaviour; Macrobenthos,2023,558,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151831,0022-0981,20,145,238,1677,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,The ontogeny of at-sea behaviour in male southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) at Marion Island,"Megafauna, such as southern elephant seals (SESs) (Mirounga leonina, Linn.), forage in diverse, seemingly lim-itless habitats. In pelagic settings, their behaviour is more likely to be limited by physiological ability and prey distribution, than physical barriers. For elephant seals, their rapid growth in body size corresponds to changing physiological abilities. These changes are most pronounced for male elephant seals. While most studies have compared male and female SESs in terms of changing body size and physiological ability, few studies have compared the influence of changing body size on behaviour of male SESs from the same population using long term satellite tracking data. We describe age-related differences in movement and diving behaviour for male SESs from Marion Island. We analysed satellite tracking data collected from 23 male SESs seals fitted with Sea Mammal Research Unit Satellite Relay Data Loggers at Marion Island between 2005 and 2011. Each dive was assigned a behavioural mode, either `searching' or `transit', using state-space modelling. We used mixed-effects models to quantify the influence of age and behavioural mode on dive duration, surface duration, dive depth and number of daily dives. Younger seals travelled significantly further from Marion Island and spent most of their dives in transit mode, whereas older seals stayed closer to the island but were in searching mode for most of their tracks. When searching, older seals dived more frequently, displayed longer dive and surface durations, and reached greater depths than younger seals. These differences in diving behaviour seem to reflect changing physiological ability. For male SESs, changes in physiological ability necessitate behavioural plasticity, which may be the key to survival and future breeding success. Robust males are more likely to breed and must therefore, maintain their body size by adapting to local oceanic conditions.",Male southern elephant seals; Behaviour; Diving; Marion Island,2023,558,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151833,0022-0981,15,100,291,1943,4,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,"Are mussels and oysters capable of reducing the abundances of Picochlorum sp., responsible for a massive green algae bloom in Thau lagoon, France?","After an exceptional hydroclimatic year, a ``massive green algae bloom ``, dominated by the autotrophic picoeukaryote Picochlorum sp, was observed in 2018-2019 in the Thau lagoon. Oyster farmers informed decision-makers and scientists about an alarming halt to growth, loss of flesh weight and abnormal mortality in commercial size oysters, whereas mussel farmers observed no adverse effects. Two hypotheses were tested. First, Mediterranean mussels are capable of filtering Picochlorum spp. whereas Pacific and flat oysters are not. Second, picophytoplankton filtration rates vary with the size of the oyster, spats having greater ability than juveniles and commercial size oysters. A series of experiments was conducted in February 2019 using a series of beakers containing (i) three different types of solutions (1 L): water from the Thau lagoon containing Picochlorum at a rate of 45.2 million cells.L-1 (P) or diluted to 20.7 million cells. L-1 (D) and a solution of Isochrysis galbana containing 9.4 million cells. L-1; (ii) in the absence or presence of five types of bivalves: Pacific oysters of three different sizes (spat, juvenile and commercial size), flat oysters, and Mediterranean mussels of commercial size. Four separate water samples were taken during a 40-min incubation period to measure fluctuations in picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton abundances using flow cytometry. Retention efficiency (\%) was compared according to species and size. In contrast to Pacific and flat oysters, mussels with an average weight of 21.4 g, were able to drastically reduce the abundances of Picochlorum and depleted nearly one million Picochlorum cells per minute at 11.4 ?. These results suggest that the 1228 t of mussels that died in 2018 before the Picochlorum bloom could have helped limit the Picochlorum bloom if they had survived the heat and anoxia.",Crassostrea gigas; Ostrea edulis; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Filtration; Cytometry; Phytoplankton; Picoeukaryote; Picocyanobacteria,2022,556,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151797,0022-0981,23,146,284,1867,8,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,"Assessing the presence, settlement and growth of the invasive Mediterranean fanworm, Sabella spallanzanii, on mussel farms","Biofouling invasive species cause economic harm to shellfish aquaculture and require effective management strategies. Therefore, a better understanding of the life cycle and spread of key pest species for more efficient surveillance approaches is needed. The main purpose of this study was to assess effectiveness of detecting the invasive Mediterranean fanworm, Sabella spallanzanii, at mussel farms using environmental DNA and RNA (eDNA/ eRNA) approaches and compare the results to visual surveys that were undertaken to detect presence, settlement seasonality and growth of the fanworm on different settlement substrates. Monthly biofilm and seawater samples were taken around three mussel farm sites and tested for S. spallanzanii eDNA and eRNA signals using a species-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay. Occupancy modelling applied on the eDNA-based detections indicated the fanworm's probability of detection at 90\% of all sampled locations regardless of month or depth. Environmental DNA ddPCR copy numbers were highly variable but were detected in every monthly sample. Specifically, month and sampling matrix (seawater or biofilm) contributed significantly to predicting the eDNA signal strength (p < 0.001). Unfortunately, eRNA detections were very low and only ten out of 48 samples yielded a positive eRNA detection. Observations from settlement substrates showed that it took around 8 months for the fanworms to grow to \~{}5 cm in length and they preferred to settle on more complex rather than smooth surfaces. Our results suggest that a species-specific eDNA/RNA ddPCR assay at a mussel farm, followed by further visual or settlement monitoring could aid increased vigilance for detecting the arrival of newly invasive species at an early settlement stage.",Aquaculture; Biofouling; Marine invasive species; Sabella spallanzanii; Environmental DNA; RNA; Recruitment,2022,554,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151767,0022-0981,16,122,263,1781,7,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Body colourations affect predation risk from fish in fiddler crabs,"Many animals show conspicuous colour patterns that inform potential predators about their unprofitability due to their toxicity or unpalatability (aposematism). However, no systematic work has evaluated the colouration of crabs in terms of aposematism, even though many species exhibit conspicuous colouration. We conducted a laboratory study to compare predation risk from a fish predator, the barred mudskipper (Periophthalmus argentilineatus), in two sympatric fiddler crab species with different body colour patterns: Austruca perplexa with brownish-white colourations and Paraleptuca crassipes with red-and-black colour patterns. Fiddler crabs and mudskippers are active on tidal flats during low tides. A predation trial by stocking one crab and one mudskipper in a test arena was repeated five times for each species-sex combination. The animal behaviour was video recorded for 24 h, and crabs were confirmed to be alive or dead after 72 h. A. perplexa females were most vulnerable to predation from mudskippers. The attack intensity from mudskippers was stronger during the nighttime than daytime against P. crassipes females and males and A. perplexa males, suggesting that mudskippers may avoid them by visually detecting the body colouration in P. crassipes and the body structure in males of both species (i.e. a large weaponry claw) during the daytime. Mudskippers eventually preyed on and consumed some individuals in both species-sexes. Mudskippers are known to shift their main food components from small crustaceans through polychaete worms to crabs, such as fiddler crabs, and unpalatable polychaete worms tend to be brightly coloured. We suggest that the red colouration of P. crassipes may be incidental mimicry of the unpalatable red/orange-coloured polychaete worms that mudskippers might have learned to avoid.",Austruca perplexa; Paraleptuca crassipes; Aposematism; Warning signal; Defensive colouration; Prey,2022,557,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151818,0022-0981,10,66,268,1833,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Chemotaxis is important for fine scale habitat selection of early juvenile Panulirus cygnus,"The western rock lobster (Panulirus cygnus {[}George 1962]) is the basis for Australia's most valuable single species wild caught fishery. The ability of early juvenile western rock lobster to select and settle onto suitable habitats is critical for the recruitment of this commercially important species. Many marine organisms, including the western rock lobster, have highly complex olfactory systems that allow for various behaviours including habitat selection and the location of food. We tested the active habitat selection of early juvenile western rock lobsters using only chemotaxis in scent based trials. We used a Y-maze bio-assay with which we were able to present individuals with several different natural scent stimuli. This study used three commonly observed broad habitat complexes followed by three fine scale seagrass assemblages to provide different scent stimuli. Seagrass habitats were chosen significantly more often by the juvenile lobsters in the broad habitat scale trials over bare sand and turf habitats. At a finer scale, lobsters showed a mixed response but tended to choose the canopy forming seagrass species, Amphibolis antarctica {[}(Labillardie`re) Sonder \& Ascherson ex Ascherson, 1868] and Posidonia australis {[}Hooker, 1858] significantly more often than the other scents provided. This study developed a Y-maze chemotaxis assay for P. cygnus and confirmed that they respond to habitat related scent cues.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Distribution and feeding ecology of sea stars in the Gal?apagos rocky subtidal zone,"Sea stars (class Asteroidea) can play powerful and wide-ranging roles as consumers of algae and other prey in benthic ecosystems worldwide. In the Gal ` apagos rocky subtidal zone, sea stars are abundant and diverse, but their distribution, feeding habits and ecological impacts have received little attention. We compared diets and distributions of the six most abundant sea star species to examine their functional roles. Bi-annual censuses carried out between 2006 and 2014 at two depths (6-8 m, 12-15 m) at 12 sites in Gal ` apagos identified two abundance ``hotspots{''} and revealed higher densities at locations with more heterogeneous benthic topographies. Field surveys showed a high incidence of feeding (35-68\% of individuals across species) and distinct diets were evident for each species in terms of food items and dietary breadth, suggesting niche partitioning. Most species can be classified as facultative herbivores, with diets dominated by crustose and turf algae supplemented by a small proportion of sessile invertebrates. The two most abundant species, Pentaceraster cumingi and Nidorellia armata, had the narrowest diets. Field prey selectivity experiments identified P. cumingi as a size-selective predator of small pencil urchins Eucidaris galapagensis. In field caging experiments, N. armata reduced biomass of unbleached crustose coralline algae by 72\%.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Eelgrass meadows harbor more macrofaunal species but bare sediments can be as functionally diverse,"Seagrass meadows are important ecosystem engineers, providing habitat for a range of marine organisms which sustain many ecosystem functions. Due to global loss of seagrass, conservation and restoration incentives are rapidly increasing. However, it is not well understood how environmental setting affects the structural and functional diversity of macrofaunal communities in eelgrass meadows (Zostera marina), and to what extent their importance as macrofaunal habitat is affected by abiotic variables across spatial scales. In the present study, we explored macrofaunal communities in eelgrass meadows and adjacent bare habitats across contrasting envi-ronments in Southern Sweden. We assessed taxonomic and functional diversity in concert and evaluated envi-ronmental properties as explanatory variables for the observed differences. Our results showed that eelgrass meadows supported a significantly higher taxonomic richness and abundance compared to adjacent bare sedi-ments whereas differences in structural and functional diversity was mainly a function of site and highly influenced by dominance of the polychaete Pygospio elegans. Interestingly, functional redundancy was higher in brackish compared to marine sites, illustrating the effect of generalist species that cover a wide range of func-tional traits. Abiotic sediment variables did not explain the variation in structural or functional diversity, but were largely overshadowed by the effect of eelgrass and its belowground biomass. From a restoration perspec-tive, our results imply that the positive effects of eelgrass restoration are similar across environments and that the presence of eelgrass is the most important factor in structuring benthic communities, but the effects on functional diversity and redundancy need further attention.",Seagrass; Benthos; Macroinvertebrates; Infauna; Functional traits,2022,554,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151777,0022-0981,14,98,249,1812,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,"Fussy eaters, bait loss and escapees: How reliable are baited-hook assessments of shark abundance in shallow, coastal waters?","Sets of baited hooks decrease in fishing efficacy over time as catch accumulates and bait is lost, and this complicates the quantification of fishing effort for species abundance calculations. Although hook-timers facilitate a more accurate estimation of fishing time, they cannot provide taxonomic information in the case of escapees or bait loss, nor can they provide information on animals that approach the gear but do not physically engage with it. To overcome these limitations, the present study attached sport action cameras to baited drumlines during a catch-and-release survey of sharks in the shallow, coastal waters of the eastern Caicos Bank, Turks and Caicos Islands. Overall, the true fishing time was found to be appreciably less than the apparent fishing time and more sharks approached or interacted with the gear than were successfully captured by it. Furthermore, shark-gear interactions varied by species while the amount of bait loss differed between deployment areas. Taken together, these findings suggest that baited-hook surveys underestimate shark abundance and that the magnitude of this error varies by species and habitat type.",Elasmobranch; CPUE; Drumline; Bait loss; de-barbed hook,2022,556,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151794,0022-0981,18,125,175,1157,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,"Genetic and morphological identification of formalin fixed, preserved larval fishes; can we have the best of both worlds?","Surveys of larval fishes require accurate identifications of larvae, which are essential to understand early life history of fish, fish ecology and fisheries. However, the identification of larval fishes requires microscopic examination that is substantially more difficult than that of juvenile and adult fishes, as many larval stages remain undescribed. Furthermore, the traditional, formalin fixation of larval fishes were previously thought to prevent genetic sequencing compared to ethanol preserved larvae. In this study, we used an integrative taxonomic approach based on morphology, imaging and DNA barcoding of the mitochondrial (mtDNA) cytochrome c oxidase subunit (COI) gene. We used this approach in both cultured yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi and wild sourced fish larvae that had been fixed in 5\% formalin. Based on controlled and in-field formalin treatments, DNA barcoding and genetic species identification was 100\% successful in cultured yellowtail kingfish fixed in formalin for up to 6 months, while barcoding of wild caught fish larvae enabled species identification of 93\% of up to 8-weeks formalin fixed specimens. Furthermore, we demonstrated the viability of using either whole larval individuals or a single eyeball (<1 mm diameter, thus retaining the specimen intact) from formalin fixed larval fish for genetic species identification. While COI genetic identifications from the in-field experiments were patchier than the controlled experiments, our study highlights the possibility of recovering suitable DNA from larvae that have been fixed in formalin for up to six months. This was achieved by applying DNA extraction methods that use de-cross-linking steps and species identification based on both full-length reference and minibarcodes. Our study provides the larval fish research community with a practical framework for undertaking both morphological and genetic identifications of larval fish assemblages, particularly when geographic relevant reference sequence databases (based on vouchered adult fishes) are available for interrogation. It also simplifies field-based collection of samples allowing their preservation in formalin without compromising the genetic identification of species.",COI barcoding; Ichthyoplankton; Ocean observing; Barcode of life data system; Species identification,2022,553,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151763,0022-0981,18,121,314,2239,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Ghost crab predation of loggerhead turtle eggs across thermal habitats,"The reproductive success of sea turtles is highly influenced by the environmental and biological conditions of the nesting beach. Maio Island, Cabo Verde, one of the main nesting sites for the Northeast Atlantic loggerhead subpopulation, displays marked heterogeneity of sand coloration, with dark, mixed and light sandy beaches, resulting in different thermal habitats. Considering that sand temperature can influence both sea turtle embryo development and predatory activity by ghost crabs - the main predators of clutches and hatchlings at Cabo Verde - we surveyed loggerhead nesting beaches at Maio Island, with three sand colorations ('beach type'), to assess: 1) the density and size of ghost crab burrows, as a proxy for ghost crab density and size, and 2) ghost crab predation on 70 loggerhead nests. We further assessed nest site selection, by considering the number of nesting activities and clutches laid across beach type. There were no evident trends in the distributions of ghost crab density and size between years or beach type. We found that ghost crab predation is a major source of mortality in Maio Island, affecting 67.8\% (n = 59) of the nests. Ghost crab predation was variable between beaches, but generally, at the warmer dark sand beaches, clutch mortality was mostly caused by ghost crab predation (53.2\%, n = 17), while at the mixed sand beaches mortality by predation was low (7.5\%, n = 18), compared to mortality due to other causes (49.9\%), indicating that other factors can also significantly impact clutch survival. The mixed sand beaches had more nesting activities and higher nest density (2.29/m(2); 1.25/m(2), respectively), compared to the light sand (0.72/m(2); 0.35/m(2)) and the dark sand beaches (0.73/m(2); 0.27/m(2)), suggesting a possible predation-free nesting preference. Our findings show that some beaches are in need of nest protection, thus we recommend both in situ nest protection and egg translocation to safe hatcheries, depending on the threats identified, to enhance clutch survival at such heterogeneous nesting areas as Maio Island.",Caretta caretta; Clutch mortality; Thermal habitats; Ghost crab predation; Sea turtles; Cabo Verde,2022,551,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151735,0022-0981,10,70,325,2094,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes

Yet, excessive amounts of drift macroalgae can be harmful, reducing the abundance of both aquatic angiosperms and animals by causing localized hypoxia. To ascertain the effects of drift macroalgae at biomasses commonly found in the northern Gulf of Mexico, we quantified recruitment into drift macroalgae without the presence of seagrass and measured associated changes to temperature, dissolved oxygen, and flow in Redfish Bay, Texas and Big Lagoon, Florida, USA. These locations comprise different coastal ecosystems with different compositions of drift macroalgae. In both locations, the presence of macroalgae significantly increased recruitment of small nekton, with higher abundances and species richness found within macroalgae relative to adjacent artificial macroalgae. Flow velocity and dissolved oxygen levels were lower in macroalgae than in adjacent artificial or bare substrate, but still remained above hypoxic levels over daily fluctuations. Despite lower oxygen levels at night, and overall lower water flow, organisms readily recruited into drift macroalgae more so than the artificial habitats nearby. However, the reduction in oxygen reveals that in higher biomasses, macroalgae could adversely affect animals.",ADV; Diel oxygen cycle; Dissolved oxygen; Flow; Recruitment; Species richness,2022,557,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151808,0022-0981,16,103,194,1397,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,"High variability in nest site selection in a loggerhead turtle rookery, in Boa Vista Island, Cabo Verde","Among sea turtles, nest site selection is a crucial factor for hatching success and population viability. The relocation of otherwise doomed clutches to safe hatcheries has been widely promoted as a conservation strategy, although this may promote artificial selection of poorly adapted genotypes. In this study, we used multiyear spatial nesting data of individual loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) from one of the largest Atlantic rookeries, in Cabo Verde, across six consecutive nesting seasons (2013-2018), to identify spatial nesting patterns, assess how individual nest site selection is influenced by female size and age, and estimate the impacts on the reproductive output. Although females nested across the entire beach width, they preferentially nested in the middle of the beach, avoiding to nest both close to the tideline and close to the vegetation line. Hatching success decreased towards the waterline, while the risk of nest inundation or predation was high, regardless of nest location. In general, females showed high variability in nest site selection, except larger females (> 93 cm curved carapace length) that showed higher repeatability (r = 0.50, SE = 0.14, 95\% CI: 0.16-0.72) in distances to the vegetation. We therefore suggest that the relocation of doomed clutches should be considered for this endangered rookery, as clutch relocation should not substantially distort the gene pool, assuming nest choice is a heritable trait. In addition, we recommend the preservation of beach vegetation, particularly in areas with human development.",Nest site selection; Repeatability analysis; Hatching success; Loggerhead turtle; Cabo Verde; Caretta caretta,2022,556,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151798,0022-0981,17,103,236,1570,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Impact of a macrofaunal ecosystem engineer on its assemblage and its habitat in mixed sediments as assessed through manipulative experiments,"Ecosystem engineers can modify the environment, affecting the associated community. Studies of mussels as ecosystem engineers have been conducted mostly in the rocky intertidal zone, while those in sedimentary intertidals have been relatively scarce. The present study assessed the effect of varying densities of Brachidontes rodriguezii on local environmental variables (substrate weight, water content, organic matter, weight of sediments adhering to mussel byssus) and ecological attributes of the associated community (richness, abundance, diversity, evenness, and assemblage structure) at different intertidal levels, sites, and seasons, in a mixed sediment intertidal region in San Antonio Bay (Patagonia, Argentina). We performed two independent manipulative field experiments at low and mid intertidal levels at two sites-Punta Verde (PV), with relatively higher current velocities and coarser grain sizes than Punta Delgado (PD)-in both winter and summer. Manipulative experiments consisted in reducing mussel density to 50\% in the low intertidal and increasing that density to up to 100\% in the mid zone. We hypothesized that local environmental variables and ecological attributes associated with B. rodriguezii depended on mussel density. The reduction in B. rodriguezii density increased the evenness and reduced the abundance at PD plus reduced the richness at PV. Also, when reducing mussel density, the assemblage structure differed in water content and organic matter at both sites between treatments and seasons. The sediment weight adhering to mussel byssus in PD and substrate weight in PV were the best descriptors of the assemblages. The increase in mussel density, however, produced a weak effect on the ecological attributes of the community, and the assemblage structure did not correlate with the environmental variables considered. Our results demonstrated a stronger engineering effect of B. rodriguezii at reduced, but not increased, mussel density. This study revealed that the ecological attributes associated with B. rodriguezii both were density-dependent and varied with sites along the year in mixed-sediment intertidal zones.",Ecosystem engineers; Mixed-sediment intertidal; Brachidontes rodriguezii; Mussel density; Environmental variables; Macrofaunal assemblage,2022,554,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151766,0022-0981,20,140,308,2163,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Intergenerational effects of ocean acidification on reproductive traits of an estuarine copepod,"Copepods are an important part of the marine food web because of their high biomass productivity and nutrient turnover rate compared to other zooplankton in the marine ecosystem. Despite their great ecological role in the ocean, there is only limited information available on the consequences of ocean acidification (OA) induced by the future increase in CO2 on the planet. More specifically, there is almost no information about the impact of OA on the European copepod Calanipeda aquaedulcis Kritschagin, 1873. Therefore, the present investigation hypothe-sized that OA would not produce negative multigenerational effects on the survival and reproductive perfor-mance of this copepod species. Here we assessed, the multigenerational (F1 and F2) effect of OA on eight important reproductive traits (maturity, prosome length, fertility, egg release, hatching success, survival rate, reproductive performance, and the total number of adults per generation). For this study, C. aquaedulcis were collected from the Guadalquivir River (southwest of Spain) and were exposed to four different pH gradients (pH 8.1 as control and pH 7.5, 7.0, 6.5 as acidified conditions) to mimic the future seawater acidification scenarios. The survival rate from nauplius to adult, C. aquaedulcis was significantly reduced by pHs and across generations. Besides, results also indicated that there were marked effects on fertility, reflected by a significantly lower number of eggs per female in each generation. Similarly, hatching success also showed a decreasing pattern towards low pH, and importantly, F1 females had lower hatching success than F0 females. While a beneficial parental effect was detected in the offspring in response to OA, it was insufficient to offset the negative effects caused by it. The findings presented here appear to have ecological significance, as decreasing the reproductive performance of copepods may have a negative impact on the marine food web, as ichthyofaunal feeding and growth are heavily reliant on this component of the food web.",Calanipeda aquaedulcis; Copepods; Guadalquivir River; Plankton; Zooplankton; Estuaries; Acidification,2022,557,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151799,0022-0981,12,95,308,2054,7,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Is it possible to photoperiod manipulate spawning time in planktivorous fish? A long-term experiment on Atlantic herring,"The oocyte development (vitellogenesis) of individual fish is highly dependent upon their physiology which is influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Thus, if individuals encounter poor biophysical conditions, they will likely be unable to reproduce. The photoperiod is an external factor that is constant between years but with increasing intra-annual (seasonal) variation polewards. In high-latitude marine environments, several ecological processes are strongly photic entrained, e.g., the planktonic spring bloom. However, it is still unclear whether day length or planktonic peaks (feeding opportunity) is the main timer or regulator behind gametogenesis not only for teleost piscivores but also for planktivores living in these waters. Hence, we experimentally investigated the role of photoperiod steering vitellogenesis in the planktivomus Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), rearing larvae up to the mature adult stage. We imposed a natural and 6-month offset photoperiod hypothesising that vitellogenesis is entrained by this photic zeitgeber. The results of our experiment clearly demonstrated that herring have a strong photic zeitgeber acting upon vitellogenesis according to the experienced photoperiod. Thus, the Offset Group showed a displacement in vitellogenesis of 6 months. The second hypothesis that feeding opportunities play a clear role in assisting this photic zeitgeber in Atlantic herring could be rejected. This clarification supports that the survival potential of the larvae is the main selection pressure in operation in these respects, i.e., rather than the extent of feeding opportunities of the adults.",Photoperiod; Vitellogenesis; Common garden experiment; Zeitgeber; Planktivorous,2022,552,NA,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151737,0022-0981,17,120,232,1648,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,"Cell adhesion and immune response, two main functions altered in the transcriptome of seasonally regressed testes of two mammalian species","In species with seasonal breeding, male specimens undergo substantial testicular regression during the nonbreeding period of the year. However, the molecular mechanisms that control this biological process are largely unknown. Here, we report a transcriptomic analysis on the Iberian mole, Talpa occidentalis, in which the desquamation of live, nonapoptotic germ cells is the major cellular event responsible for testis regression. By comparing testes at different reproductive states (active, regressing, and inactive), we demonstrate that the molecular pathways controlling the cell adhesion function in the seminiferous epithelium, such as the MAPK, ERK, and TGF-beta signaling, are altered during the regression process. In addition, inactive testes display a global upregulation of genes associated with immune response, indicating a selective loss of the ``immune privilege{''} that normally operates in sexually active testes. Interspecies comparative analyses using analogous data from the Mediterranean pine vole, a rodent species where testis regression is controlled by halting meiosis entry, revealed a common gene expression signature in the regressed testes of these two evolutionary distant species.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,Evaluating old truths: Final adult size in holometabolous insects is set by the end of larval development,"For centuries, it has been understood that the final size of adult holometabolous insects is determined by the end of the larval stage, and that once they transform to adults, holometabolous insects do not grow. Despite this, no previous study has directly tested these ``old truths{''} across holometabolous insects. Here, we demonstrate that final adult size is set at the end of the last larval stage in species representing each of the four orders of holometabolous insects: the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera), the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera), the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus (Coleoptera), and the Florida carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus (Hymenoptera). Furthermore, in both D. melanogaster and C. floridanus, we show that the size of adult individuals fluctuates but does not significantly change. Therefore, our study finally confirms these two basic assumptions in the biology of insects, which have for centuries served as the foundation for studies of insect growth, size, and allometry.",allometry; body mass; Camponotus; holometabolous insects; insect growth; Drosophila; morphometrics; Manduca; Onthophagus,2023,340,3,10.1002/jez.b.23165,1552-5007,17,105,155,1032,9,NA,250,6,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,Evolution and functionalization of vitellogenin genes in the termite Reticulitermes speratus,"Eusociality has been commonly observed in distinct animal lineages. The reproductive division of labor is a particular feature, achieved by the coordination between fertile and sterile castes within the same nest. The sociogenomic approach in social hymenopteran insects indicates that vitellogenin (Vg) has undergone neo-functionalization in sterile castes. Here, to know whether Vgs have distinct roles in nonreproductive castes in termites, we investigated the unique characteristics of Vgs in the rhinotermitid termite Reticulitermes speratus. The four Vgs were identified from R. speratus (RsVg1-4), and RsVg3 sequences were newly identified using the RACE method. Molecular phylogenetic analysis supported the monophyly of the four termite Vgs. Moreover, the termites Vg1-3 and Vg4 were positioned in two different clades. The dN/dS ratios indicated that the branch leading to the common ancestor of termite Vg4 was under weak purifying selection. Expression analyses among castes (reproductives, workers, and soldiers) and females (nymphs, winged alates, and queens) showed that RsVg1-3 was highly expressed in fertile queens. In contrast, RsVg4 was highly expressed in workers and female nonreproductives (nymphs and winged adults). Localization of RsVg4 messenger RNA was confirmed in the fat body of worker heads and abdomens. These results suggest that Vg genes are functionalized after gene duplication during termite eusocial transition and that Vg4 is involved in nonreproductive roles in termites.",eusocial insects; gene expression; molecular evolution; reproductive division of labor; vitellogenin,2023,340,1,10.1002/jez.b.23141,1552-5007,11,92,216,1512,5,NA,250,6,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,On the hormonal control of posterior regeneration in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii,"Regeneration is the process by which many animals are able to restore lost or injured body parts. After amputation of the posterior part of its body, the annelid Platynereis dumerilii is able to regenerate the pygidium, the posteriormost part of its body that bears the anus, and a subterminal growth zone containing stem cells that allows the subsequent addition of new segments. The ability to regenerate their posterior part (posterior regeneration) is promoted, in juvenile worms, by a hormone produced by the brain and is lost when this hormonal activity becomes low at the time the worms undergo their sexual maturation. By characterizing posterior regeneration at the morphological and molecular levels in worms that have been decapitated, we show that the presence of the head is essential for multiple aspects of posterior regeneration, as well as for the subsequent production of new segments. We also show that methylfarnesoate, the molecule proposed to be the brain hormone, can partially rescue the posterior regeneration defects observed in decapitated worms. Our results are therefore consistent with a key role of brain hormonal activity in the control of regeneration and growth in P. dumerilii, and support the hypothesis of the involvement of methylfarnesoate in this control.",annelid; brain hormone; hormonal regulation; methylfarnesoate; Platynereis; regeneration,2023,340,4,10.1002/jez.b.23182,1552-5007,12,86,202,1295,6,NA,250,6,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,Resolving between novelty and homology in the rapidly evolving phallus of Drosophila,"The genitalia present some of the most rapidly evolving anatomical structures in the animal kingdom, possessing a variety of parts that can distinguish recently diverged species. In the Drosophila melanogaster group, the phallus is adorned with several processes, pointed outgrowths, that are similar in size and shape between species. However, the complex three-dimensional nature of the phallus can obscure the exact connection points of each process. Previous descriptions based upon adult morphology have primarily assigned phallic processes by their approximate positions in the phallus and have remained largely agnostic regarding their homology relationships. In the absence of clearly identified homology, it can be challenging to model when each structure first evolved. Here, we employ a comparative developmental analysis of these processes in eight members of the melanogaster species group to precisely identify the tissue from which each process forms. Our results indicate that adult phallic processes arise from three pupal primordia in all species. We found that in some cases the same primordia generate homologous structures whereas in other cases, different primordia produce phenotypically similar but remarkably non-homologous structures. This suggests that the same gene regulatory network may have been redeployed to different primordia to induce phenotypically similar traits. Our results highlight how traits diversify and can be redeployed, even at short evolutionary scales.",Drosophila; genitalia; homology; rapid evolution,2023,340,2,10.1002/jez.b.23113,1552-5007,12,84,214,1502,4,NA,250,6,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,The ring-legged earwig Euborellia annulipes as a new model for oogenesis and development studies in insects,"Insects are the dominant group of animals on Earth. Despite this abundance, most of our knowledge about many aspects of their biology and development come from a unique model, the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Nevertheless, in the last years, the advances in molecular tools and imaging techniques have allowed the emergence of new insect models, adding valuable information to decipher the morphogenetic bases behind the formation and evolution of the vast diversity of shapes, sizes, and patterns that characterize them. Earwigs belong to Dermaptera which is a small order clustered in the Polyneopteran group. They are hemimetabolous insects with a flattened body, characteristic abdominal pincers, and maternal care behavior. This last feature and their role in agroecosystems have been studied in cosmopolitan species such as Forficula auricularia and Euborellia annulipes; however, their reproduction and embryonic development have been poorly addressed in laboratory conditions. In response, here we describe the ring-legged earwig Euborellia annulipes embryogenesis and life cycle from nymphal to adult stages, its reproduction, and essential morphological and behavioral characters. Additionally, using confocal and transmission electron microscopy we analyzed in detail the morphogenesis of its peculiar meroistic polytrophic ovary. Our aim is to provide an emerging model system to perform comparative studies on insect oogenesis, development, and morphological evolution.",comparative developmental biology; Dermaptera; embryo development; Evo-devo; insect model; meroistic polytrophic ovary,2023,340,1,10.1002/jez.b.23121,1552-5007,16,107,209,1491,6,NA,250,6,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,A novel role for ATP2B in ascidians: Ascidian-specific mutations in ATP2B contribute to sperm chemotaxis,"Sperm chemotaxis, in which sperms are attracted to conspecific eggs via species-specific attractants, plays an important role in fertilization. This phenomenon has been observed in various animals and species-specific sperm attractants have been reported in some species. However, the mechanisms involved in the reception and recognition of the species-specific attractant by the sperms is poorly studied. Previously, we found that the plasma membrane-type Ca2+/ATPase (PMCA) is the receptor for the sperm-activating and -attracting factor (SAAF) in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. To determine the role of PMCA in species-specific sperm chemotaxis, we identified the amino acid sequences of PMCAs derived from six Phlebobranchia species. The testis-specific splice variant of PMCA was found to be present in all the species investigated and the ascidian-specific sequence was detected near the 3 `-terminus. Moreover, dN/dS analysis revealed that the extracellular loops 1, 2, and 4 in ascidian PMCA underwent a positive selection. These findings suggest that PMCA recognizes the species-specific structure of SAAF at the extracellular loops 1, 2, and 4, and its testis-specific C-terminal region is involved in the activation and chemotaxis of ascidian sperms.",ascidian; chemotaxis; fertilization; plasma membrane Ca2+; ATPase (PMCA); species-specificity; sperm,2022,338,7,10.1002/jez.b.23133,1552-5007,15,104,182,1263,7,NA,250,6,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes

In this study, we developed a specific antibody and further characterized the expression patterns of SCD5a in males at different mating stages by western blot. SCD5a was mainly expressed in male heads rather than in abdomens. Along with the aging process (from Day 1 to Day 3), SCD5a increased significantly. Compared with virgin males, mated males showed higher levels of SCD5a. Likewise, abdomen dipping frequency, during which males release attracting pheromone, increased with age and mating. Moreover, real-time quantitative PCR revealed that genes responsible for the first three steps of attracting pheromone biosynthesis were more highly expressed in head than in abdomen, but the final gene for transformation of attracting pheromone was more highly expressed in abdomen than in head. These results suggest that linoleic acid for biosynthesis of attracting pheromones may also originate from the head rather than only synthesized at the rectal vesicles.",abdomen dipping; biosynthesis; fatty acid desaturase; jewel wasp; sex pheromone,2022,338,7,10.1002/jez.b.23120,1552-5007,18,128,175,1170,5,NA,250,6,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes

Variation of chondrocranial features is known across species, but little is known about intraspecific variation, or its evolution in the context of domestication. Here, we investigated two specific structures of the chondrocranium in three windows of embryonic development. The anatomy of one of these structures was also compared among adult skulls of chickens and their wild ancestor (red junglefowl [}RJF]). The proccesus tectalis and the prenasal process, along with the surrounding area of the orbitonasal foramina, presented variation throughout the ontogeny and in the adults. The processus tectalis showed distinct variation from the earliest stage studied to the adult. The numbers of orbitonasal foramina were also found to be variable in the ancestor and breeds studied. Furthermore, during early embryonic development, the prenasal process is similar across breeds and RJF, but later in embryonic development this structure presents variable states. The embryonic and adult variation found herein could be an example of intraspecific variation under domestication, resulting from different types of tissue interrelationship during development.",chondrocranium; embryonic variation; red junglefowl; skull,2022,338,"8, SI",10.1002/jez.b.23177,1552-5007,5,49,191,1315,4,NA,250,6,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION,Evidence of positive selection on six spider developmental genes,"Spiders constitute more than 49,000 described species distributed all over the world, and all ecological environments. Their order, Araneae, is defined by a set of characteristics with no parallel among their arachnid counterparts (e.g., spinnerets, silk glands, chelicerae that inoculate venom, among others). Changes in developmental pathways often underlie the evolution of morphological synapomorphies, and as such spiders are a promising model to study the role of developmental genes in the origin of evolutionary novelties. With that in mind, we investigated changes in the evolutionary regime of a set of six developmental genes, using spiders as our model. The genes were mainly chosen for their roles in spinneret ontogeny, yet they are pleiotropic, and it is likely that the origins of other unique morphological phenotypes are also linked to changes in their sequences. Our results indicate no great differences in the selective pressures on those genes when comparing spiders to other arachnids, but a few site-specific positive selection evidence were found in the Araneae lineage. These findings lead us to new insights on spider evolution that are to be further tested.",Araneae; appendages; development; molecular evolution; morphological novelty,2022,338,5,10.1002/jez.b.23119,1552-5007,9,64,181,1185,5,NA,250,6,Other structure requirements,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,An Evaluation of Goldeye Life History Characteristics in Two Kansas Reservoirs,"Goldeye Hiodon alosoides are native through much of Canada and the Mississippi River drainage in the United States. Life history characteristics have been described for several commercially important populations in northern portions of their range, but there is a paucity of information available for more southernly populations. Milford and Lovewell Reservoirs are in the Kansas River basin and harbor the only two lentic Goldeye populations in Kansas. Further, anecdotal observations suggest declining population abundance. We sought to examine temporal trends in relative abundance and describe current size structure, body condition, and population dynamics of these two remnant populations. Both populations had decreasing relative abundance over the previous 24-y period, although decreases in the Lovewell population were most profound. In Milford Reservoir, the median total length of sampled Goldeye was 268 mm (minimum = 235 mm; maximum = 431 mm). The estimated maximum observed age for Goldeye was 8; however, age-1 Goldeye were the most abundant year-class that we collected, accounting for 80\% of sampled fish. We fit a von Bertalanffy growth model to back-calculated length at annulus formation with parameter estimates of L-infinity = 402 mm, K = 0.93, and t(0) = 0.29. We collected two individuals at Lovewell Reservoir; therefore, no analyses were conducted. Overall, this study provides cursory knowledge of two remnant Goldeye populations in Kansas.

JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Assessment of Cereal Grain Waste Densities to Aid Waterfowl Conservation Planning in the Klamath Basin,"Postharvest waste seed from cereal grains is a major dietary component of waterfowl in the Klamath Basin in northeastern California and southeastern Oregon, a region that plays host to over a million waterfowl annually. Understanding food abundance is critical to local waterfowl management; therefore, we conducted a study in 2008 to investigate waste grain densities in barley, oat, and wheat fields. We used hierarchal mixed effect models to assess several factors that may affect waste grain densities postharvest. We also compared the effects of residue management practices to measure the effect of these treatments. To understand the scope of postharvest practices, we conducted a weekly road survey to document treatments applied to fields in our study area. We found that region best explained the variance of postharvest waste grain in barley fields, where the Tule Lake region had 89\% greater densities than Lower Klamath. Neither harvester age nor baling affected waste grain in oats fields. In wheat fields, the model containing region and lodging ranked highest, where the Tule Lake region had 66\% greater waste densities than Lower Klamath, and lodging increased waste grain by 70\%. Burning did not reduce waste grain in barley or oat fields. Chisel-disking reduced waste grain by 94\% in wheat fields compared with postharvest. Our field treatment survey found that 70\% of barley fields were untreated while 18\% were disked and 13\% were burned and flooded. We estimated that 82\% of oat fields were burned postharvest, while 18\% were burned and flooded. In wheat, 61\% of fields were left untreated, while 16\% were disked, 8\% were chisel-plowed, and 7\% were flooded postharvest. Flooding and burning occurred primarily on National Wildlife Refuges, while disking, chisel-plowing, and postharvest irrigation occurred solely on private properties. Our results indicate that reducing tillage treatments would boost accessibility of cereal grain food resources to waterfowl in the Klamath Basin, and incentives to flood grain fields on private properties should be considered for the same purpose when and where possible.",barley; Klamath Basin; oat; straw residue management; wheat; waste grain,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-20-091,1944-687X,15,102,328,2143,6,15,300,NA,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Can an Avian Electrocution Risk Model From California Guide Retrofitting Throughout the Western United States?,"A previously published model of avian electrocution risk, the ``2014 model,{''} compared power poles that electrocuted birds (electrocution poles; including 21 golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos electrocutions) with poles not known to have electrocuted birds (comparison poles). The 2014 model produces pole-specific risk index scores between 0 and 1. The scores rank relative risk so electric utilities can maximize conservation benefits per dollar spent by focusing retrofitting on poles with greatest risk. Although the creation of the 2014 model encompassed a study population of birds and poles in southern California, the 2014 model has potential for use in managing a target population of raptors including golden eagles throughout the western United States. Use beyond southern California is only appropriate if the study population is similar enough to the target population for the 2014 model to predict risk effectively. To evaluate similarity, we examined five sources of evidence: 1) the relative consistency in electrical safety codes for power poles; 2) the body sizes of golden eagles in the study and target populations; and consistency in structure-specific factors associated with 3) golden eagle electrocutions in other studies, 4) other avian electrocutions, and 5) previously unreported golden eagle electrocutions. We found that although the study population in the 2014 model included relatively few golden eagles, data were sufficient to create a model that is applicable to a target population throughout the western United States. The model also can be useful in helping determine equivalencies between pole types if utilities seek to compare benefits of retrofitting small numbers of high-risk poles with large numbers of low-risk poles.",Aquila chrysaetos; electrocution; power line; prediction; risk assessment,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-21-046,1944-687X,15,110,262,1761,5,15,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Carnivore Occupancy within the Early Successional Habitat of New England Cottontails,"Predation pressure from carnivores can shape ecological communities and has significant consequences for prey species that are declining or recovering from historical declines. New England cottontails Sylvilagus transitionalis are a species of greatest conservation need in Connecticut and are experiencing continued decline associated with habitat loss. Restoration of early successional habitat is underway to address the most significant threat to their populations. However, one of the largest documented sources of mortality is associated with several key predators and remains a threat to recovery efforts. We sought to develop species-specific occupancy estimates of carnivores in early successional habitat and relate our findings to the potential recovery of New England cottontails. We conducted camera surveys at 34 sites in early successional habitat in or near New England cottontail focus areas throughout Connecticut and used the program MARK to estimate occupancy and detectability from detection data. We found key predators in early successional habitat, but their detectability was generally low. Occupancy was highest for coyotes Canis latrans, and regional occupancy differed only for bobcats Lynx rufus. Covariates that influenced parameter estimates in our models included high road densities and the intensity of New England cottontail and eastern cottontail Sylvilagus floridanus detections. Expanding carnivores, particularly coyote and bobcat, may place additional pressure on New England cottontail recovery in the state, but restoration efforts that promote contiguous habitat and reduce isolated patches where predation risk is higher will improve their chances of a long-term recovery.",carnivores; occupancy modeling; cottontail; early succession; detection,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-21-049,1944-687X,11,84,240,1716,5,15,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Demographic and Evolutionary History of Pallid and Shovelnose Sturgeon in the Upper Missouri River,"Natural-origin Pallid Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus in the upper Missouri River are predicted to become extirpated as early as 2024. To aid in recovery efforts for this endangered species, we used genetic data from 17 microsatellite loci to infer demographic and evolutionary history of Pallid Sturgeon and a sympatric Shovelnose Sturgeon S. platorynchus. Our data indicated a recent sundering of geneflow between these species by overlapping allele size distributions at all loci and low level of genetic divergence (F-ST = 0.10). Tests for recent bottlenecks by using heterozygosity excess or allele frequency mode-shift tests indicated demographic stability for both species, while the M ratio identified that historic bottlenecks occurred in both species. Estimates of historical effective population size (N-e), based on coalescent modeling of allele size distribution, suggested that the geographic expansion of these species into the upper Missouri River during the late Pleistocene was associated with 10- to 19-fold reductions in N-e. By contrast contemporary estimates of N-e based on linkage disequilibrium revealed that Shovelnose Sturgeon (N-e = 2,983) had approximately 10 times greater N-e than Pallid Sturgeon (N-e = 254). Our results are consistent with the recent collapse of Pallid Sturgeon being caused by dam construction, which occurred between 1930 and 1965. Fortunately, genetic diversity remaining in this long-lived species provided an opportunity to conserve predam Pallid Sturgeon genetic diversity via a successful captive breeding program.

Terrestrial adults and juveniles of this cryptic biphasic species are difficult to survey as they are small, do not vocalize, and may be associated with woody ground structures or subsurface refugia at considerable distances from natal streams. We performed a comparative analysis of the detection rate of postmetamorphic coastal tailed frogs and ecological factors hypothesized to influence detection when conducting visual encounter and pitfall trap surveys. We conducted concurrent surveys in northwestern British Columbia at six sites over similar time periods using both techniques. The average detection rate of visual encounter surveys (mean = 0.249, SD = 0.702) was greater than that of pitfall sampling (mean = 0.138, SD = 0.773) when cool temperatures and high humidity favor aboveground movement during the daytime. Light-touch ground searches of refuge habitats likely enhanced detection during visual surveys. Although the average detection rate was less, pitfall traps provided 24-h sampling and were less affected by the experience of the surveyor and the occurrence of ground cover. In general, variation in seasonal behavior influenced detection regardless of method. The relatively higher cost and fixed nature of pitfall traps should be weighed against the ability to apply more cost-effective visual encounter surveys to a greater number of sites.",Ascaphus truei; detection probability; pitfall trapping; tailed frogs; visual encounter survey,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-21-011,1944-687X,10,70,232,1573,5,15,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Factors Influencing the Postrelease Movements of Translocated Fishers: Implications for Translocation Success,"Long-distance, postrelease movements of translocated wildlife can be a key factor limiting translocation success. Yet, for many species, we have little or no understanding of factors that influence postrelease movements. Translocations have been important for recovering fisher Pekania pennanti populations across the southern portion of their North American range. However, little is known about the postrelease movements of translocated fishers and how these movements may be influenced by demographic or translocation-process factors. To restore fishers in Washington State, we moved 90 fishers from central British Columbia and released them at nine sites in the Olympic Fisher Recovery Area on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington from 2008 to 2010. We evaluated postrelease movements of 48 fishers to determine both the distance and duration of movements prior to home range establishment. Fishers moved extensively following their release. Multimodel selection indicated a high level of support for the hypothesis that postrelease movements differed by fisher sex and age; whereas, year of release had no apparent effect on movements, and release date had only a marginal influence on movements. Mean distance (??95\% CI) from a release site to a home range was greater for adult males (62.0 ?? 19.6 km) than for juvenile males (31.4 ?? 16.0 km), adult females (30.9 ?? 21.1 km), and juvenile females (29.0 ?? 13.5 km). Mean number of days from release until home range establishment was similar for the sexes; however, the variance in movement duration was greater for females. Twentysix of 27 females established home ranges over an 11-mo period (December???October), while 19 of 21 males did so within a 4-mo period (April???July). Mean home range sizes differed between males (128.3 ?? 21.1 km2) and females (63.5 ?? 9.0 km2) and were among the largest reported for the species. A greater proportion of females (18 of 27; 67\%) than males (8 of 21; 38\%) established home ranges within or partially within the recovery area. Six females left a previously established home range during the breeding season, presumably to find breeding males. Given the large distances that fishers can move following release, translocation success could be furthered by releasing individuals at fewer sites in the interior of large reintroduction areas to facilitate greater exposure to a recovery area and greater opportunity to interact with conspecifics and potential mates.",endangered; fisher; Pekania pennanti; postrelease movements; translocation,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-21-023,1944-687X,12,109,380,2469,5,15,300,NA,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Food Selection by Spring-Migrating Green-Winged Teal,"The Mississippi Flyway supports millions of waterfowl during spring migration as individuals replenish vital nutrients en route to breeding locations. Green-winged teal Anas crecca consume natural plant and animal foods in shallow wetlands during autumn and winter, but little information is available to describe food use and selection during spring migration. We experimentally collected green-winged teal and quantified food use and availability to determine selection in the Illinois River Valley during February-April 2016-2018. We removed, dried, and weighed (+/- 0.1 mg) food items by taxa from the upper digestive tract (proventriculus and esophagus) of birds and core samples for comparison. Additionally, we evaluated retention of common diet items between small (\#60; 250 mu m) and medium (\#35; 500 mu m) sieves and the effect of processing sieve size on selection coefficients. Seeds of moist-soil vegetation occurred in all green-winged teal diets, while invertebrates and vegetation material occurred in 67.4\% and 25.8\% of diets, respectively. Green-winged teal consumed 85.8\% (CI95 = 81.2-90.3\%) plant material and 14.2\% (CI95 = 9.6-18.7\%) invertebrates based on aggregate dry biomass. We failed to find support for selection of either plant or animal foods in general, but green-winged teal selected Cyperus spp., Ammannia spp., Leptochloa spp., and Potamogeton spp. and avoided Amaranthus spp., Ipomoea spp., Echinochloa spp., and Oligochaeta individual taxa. We found no support for a difference in selection ratios between sexes, but selection ratios differed among years and wetland connectivity regimes with changes in food availability. Sieve size had minimal impact on rank and selection intensity of most food items, but only small sieves captured Ammannia spp., which was an important diet item. We found no evidence that green-winged teal selected invertebrates in our midlatitude migration study area, as has been speculated for dabbling ducks in general during spring migration (i.e., spring diet-shift hypothesis).

JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,How Effective Is the Birdsbesafe (R) Cat Collar at Reducing Bird Mortality by Domestic Cats?,"The global decline of songbird populations is a well-recognized conservation issue. Domestic cats kill an estimated 2.4 billion birds each year in the United States alone-more than most other anthropogenic threats combined. As many pet owners are reluctant to keep their cats inside, collar-mounted antipredation devices for domestic cats may be an important conservation tool. We examined the effectiveness of the Birdsbesafe (R) collar cover (BCC), a sleeve of brightly patterned fabric worn over a typical breakaway collar. The BBC's designers intend for the collar's bright colors to alert potential prey to the cat's presence. By combining data from two studies in New York (2014 and 2019) and one in Florida (2019), all of which used similar methods, we tested the hypothesis that the BCC effectively reduces avian mortality caused by cats of different ages and sexes in different hunting environments. We tested 94 cats over a 12-wk period in New York in 2014 or 8-wk periods in Florida and New York in 2019 during the bird breeding seasons; cats alternated 2-wk periods with and without the collar. Across studies, we recovered 2.7 times fewer birds per cat with the BCC than without (P = 0.006). The BCC was more effective at a temperate latitude than a subtropical one (P = 0.047). There was no difference in the effectiveness of the BCC for cats of varying ages, sexes, or hunting environments. Our results suggest that the BCC could be one tool within a larger effort to decrease domestic cat predation of songbirds.",domestic cat; Felis catus; songbird mortality; invasive species,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-21-055,1944-687X,15,92,252,1528,4,15,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-Assisted Detection of Rock Outcrops in Appalachian Hardwood Forests,"The identification of small habitat features embedded within forest ecosystems is a challenge for many wildlife inventory and monitoring programs, especially for those involving rock outcrop specialist taxa. Rock outcrops are often difficult to remotely detect in dense Appalachian hardwood forests, as most outcrops remain hidden under the forest canopy and therefore invisible when relying on aerial orthoimagery to pinpoint habitat features. We investigated the ability for light detection and ranging point cloud data to identify small rock outcrops during the environmental assessment phase of a proposed management project on the Jefferson National Forest in Virginia. We specifically compared this approach with the visual identification of rock outcrops across the same area using aerial orthoimagery. Our light detection and ranging-based approach identified three times as many rock outcrop sites as aerial orthoimagery, resulting in the field verification of four times as many previously unknown populations of green salamanders Aneides aeneus (a rock outcrop specialist amphibian of high conservation concern) than would have been possible if relying on aerial orthoimagery alone to guide surveys. Our results indicate that light detection and rangingbased methods may provide an effective, efficient, and low-error approach that can remotely identify below-canopy rock outcrops embedded within Appalachian forests, especially when researchers lack pre-existing knowledge of local terrain and the location of habitat features.",LiDAR; remote sensing; rock outcrops; green salamander; amphibian,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-21-043,1944-687X,13,103,216,1539,5,15,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Limited Land Base and Competing Land Uses Force Societal Tradeoffs When Siting Energy Development,"As human populations grow, decisions regarding use of the world's finite land base become increasingly complex. We adopted a land use-conflict scenario involving renewable energy to illustrate one potential cause of these conflicts and resulting tradeoff decisions. Renewable energy industries wishing to expand operations in the United States are limited by multijurisdictional regulations in finding developable land. Interest groups entreat industries to avoid land for various reasons, including avoidance of prime wildlife habitat in accordance with an ``avoidance-first{''} mitigation strategy. By applying a uniform set of rules for renewable energy facilities to the Prairie Pothole Region and portions of the Northern Great Plains, we evaluated the effects of regulations and avoidance of prime wildlife habitat on the amount of land available for development. In our scenario, existing regulations excluded 39\% of the project area from potential development, with human infrastructure accounting for 30\% (10-66\% among states), whereas federally protected species accounted for < 1\% at project area and state levels. Unregulated lands accounted for 61\% of the project area, with conservation areas predicted as high-quality sites for breeding grassland birds and waterfowl and for migrating whooping cranes Grus americana accounting for 19\% within the project area (6-27\% among states). This model demonstrated a limited land base available for new development when accounting for regulations and concerns of a subset of societal interest groups. Additional interest groups likely will have different and competing concerns, further emphasizing the complexity of future land-use decisions as the available land base for development diminishes.",land use planning; biodiversity tradeoffs; conservation planning; energy; conservation conflict,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-21-036,1944-687X,14,97,249,1759,5,15,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

One goal of the initiative is to increase availability and enhance quality of habitat for wildlife, including the threatened Cheat Mountain salamander Plethodon nettingi. The purpose of this research was to compare microhabitat characteristics between an occupied Cheat Mountain salamander site and early-stage spruce restoration sites, and between four occupied sites and proximal nondetection sites. We found that soil pH was higher and soil moisture was lower at spruce restoration sites compared with the occupied site, and that light intensity, subcanopy air temperature, and ground-level air temperature were higher in spruce restoration sites with reduced canopy cover. We found that soil moisture was higher at occupied sites compared with proximal nondetection sites, but soil pH was not significantly different. Our study suggests that Cheat Mountain salamanders are associated with low soil pH and high soil moisture, and thus spruce restoration could enhance habitat quality for this species in the long-term.",forest; mineland; pH; moisture; Plethodon nettingi; soil; West Virginia,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-21-042,1944-687X,16,126,170,1167,7,15,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Missing Release Data in Capture-Mark-Recovery Analyses: Consequences for Inference,"Demographic probabilities, such as annual survival and harvest probability, are key metrics used in research and for monitoring the health of wildlife populations and sustainability of harvest. For waterfowl populations, annual estimates of these probabilities come from mark-recovery analysis of data from coordinated banding operations. The Brownie model is the most commonly used parameterization for analyzing mark-recovery data from harvested species. However, if banded waterfowl are not released during a year of a multiyear banding operation, then estimating annual survival and recovery probabilities from a dead recovery model is a challenge. Due to coronavirus disease 2019, many wildlife monitoring efforts, including annual waterfowl banding programs, were canceled or reduced during 2020 and 2021, highlighting the need for wildlife managers to better understand the consequences of missing data on analyses and regulatory decisions. We summarized methods of model parameterization and use of alternative methods to explore the behavior of demographic parameter estimates when a year of release data was missing. Comparing constrained fixed-effect models (we set parameters during the missing year of data equal to parameters for years with release data) with random-effect models, we found that 1) bias of estimates during a year of missing release data was smaller when using a random-effect model, 2) the direction of the bias was unpredictable, but the expected range in bias could be generally known commensurate to the underlying variability in survival and recovery probabilities, and 3) potential bias was greatest if the missing year of releases occurred during the final year of a time series. We conclude that in some circumstances, various modeling approaches can provide reasonable estimates during a year of missing release data, particularly when underlying demographic parameters, or the parameter constrained in a model, vary little over time (e.g., adult survival in long-lived species), which would result in relatively little bias in the other estimated parameter (e.g., annual recovery probability). We also suggest that using alternative analytical techniques, such as random-effect models, may improve estimates for the demographic parameters of interest when release data are missing. Random-effect models also allowed us to estimate parameters, such as juvenile recovery probabilities, during the year of missing release data, which are not identifiable using standard modeling techniques. Where accurate and precise parameter estimation is important for making harvest management decisions and regardless of the model type or the data used, there is no analytical replacement for missing release data. We suggest that practitioners determine the potential consequences for missing data through simulation by using empirical data and simulated data with known demographic probabilities to determine the best actions to take for analyzing their capture-recovery data when release data are missing.",Brownie model; Canada goose; capture-mark-recovery analyses; missing data; survival,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-21-017,1944-687X,9,82,438,3035,5,15,300,NA,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,"Population Dynamics of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout in Henrys Lake, Idaho","Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (YCT) Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri is a species with significant ecological and recreational value. In many YCT fisheries, managers are tasked with balancing angler expectations and fish conservation. Henrys Lake supports a popular trophy trout fishery, but the increase of nonnative Utah Chub Gila atraria has caused concern for YCT. We summarized long-term trends in abundance, length structure, body condition, and growth of YCT to evaluate the effect of Utah Chub. Additionally, we investigated abiotic and biotic factors influencing YCT. We examined archived hard structures to provide a comprehensive evaluation of changes in age and growth of YCT in the system. We used stocking records and catch rates of Utah Chub and trout in Henrys Lake as covariates to explain changes in YCT catch rates and growth. Catch rates varied from 1.5 to 15.4 YCT per net night during the 2002 to 2020 sampling period, but we did not identify consistent patterns. Length structure was consistently dominated by stock- to quality-length fish, and we captured few fish >600 mm in total length. Relative weight of YCT was decreased from a mean +/- standard deviation (SD) of 115.9 +/- 16.5 in 2004 to 93.2 +/- 8.2 in 2020. The age of YCT varied between 1 and 11 years; fish that we captured during 2010 to 2020 were the oldest. The majority of fish that we sampled were age 4 and younger. Total annual mortality of age-2 and older YCT was higher than other Cutthroat Trout populations (i.e., 0.70 during 2002 to 2010 and 0.60 during 2011 to 2020). Based on regression models, we identified positive relationships between catch rates of YCT, Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss x YCT hybrid trout. We observed negative relationships between growth of YCT and abundance of Utah Chub and Brook Trout. Although we identified negative relationships, YCT growth in recent decades is as fast as or faster than earlier time periods. Results from this research suggest that major changes in YCT population dynamics are not evident over the last 20 years. This study provides insight into the factors influencing an adfluvial trout population. In particular, results from this research may be useful for managers of systems where Utah Chub have been introduced.",population dynamics; Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout; adfluvial trout; Henrys Lake; growth,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-21-074,1944-687X,10,72,372,2302,5,15,300,NA,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Use of Anthropogenic Nest Materials by Black-Crested Titmice Along an Urban Gradient,"Numerous avian species use anthropogenic materials in constructing nests, particularly in urbanized environments. Researchers have demonstrated anthropogenic materials, including plastics, to have both beneficial and harmful effects on survival and reproduction. During the spring of 2018, we collected 45 black-crested titmouse Baeolophus atricristatus nests in San Marcos, Texas, with two objectives: 1) to assess and compare the mass and proportion of nest materials along an urban gradient and 2) to examine the relationship between nest materials, clutch size, and hatching success. We categorized each nest based on collection location as urban, residential, park, or rural and separated nest materials into six categories: leaves, snake skin, twigs, moss, plastic, and nonplastic artificial materials. We then compared raw mass and proportion of mass of each nest material among urbanization categories. Nests in the urban category were 1.6???1.9 times lighter in mass than nests in other locations along the urban gradient (P 1/4 0.01) and contained 4???5 times greater proportion, but not mass, of plastic compared to nests in all other locations. Nests in residential areas contained the greatest mass of combined anthropogenic materials. Neither clutch size nor hatching success differed based on urbanization category, nest mass, or proportions of anthropogenic or natural nest materials. The differences in mass of nests and increased proportion of plastics could have been due to a lack of natural nesting materials; however, we did not estimate availability of nesting materials at any location. Results add to the growing literature that the use of anthropogenic materials in nests varies across an urban gradient, and the effect of anthropogenic materials on nesting parameters varies among species.",anthropogenic materials; avian ecology; Baeolophus atricristatus; black-crested titmouse; nest materials,2022,13,1,10.3996/JFWM-21-058,1944-687X,12,84,267,1816,5,15,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,"A Case of Mistaken Identity: Genetic and Morphological Evidence for the Presence of Redeye Bass in the Verde River, Arizona","We report genetic and morphological evidence for the presence of Redeye Bass Micropterus coosae, in the Verde River of Arizona, previously thought to be Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu. We performed meristic measurements on 15 individuals sampled from the Upper Verde River Wildlife Area, Yavapai County, Arizona. Meristic data for lateral line scales, scales above lateral line, and scales below lateral line were all consistent with Redeye Bass and not Smallmouth Bass. We analyzed mitochondrial and nuclear genetic data to determine whether one of the black bass (Genus Micropterus) species historically introduced to the Verde River was Redeye Bass and whether they persist in the system. We extracted DNA from fin clips of five individuals for phylogenetic analysis of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide thorn hydrogen (NADH) dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) mitochondrial gene and for analysis of nuclear DNA using a diagnostic Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) panel. Results of the ND2 genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these fish likely originated from native Redeye Bass stock from the Coosa River system of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. Similarly, nuclear SNP data from the five individuals collected from the Verde River aligned with Redeye Bass reference genotypes based on STRUCTURE analysis. These results support the hypothesis that at least one of the introductions of black bass in Arizona's Verde River founded a previously unrecognized population of Redeye Bass. Further work is needed to determine the extent of the Redeye Bass presence in Arizona, whether Smallmouth Bass are also present in the Verde River system, and if hybridization of Redeye Bass and other black basses is occurring.",arid lands native fish conservation; black bass; fisheries management,2021,12,2,10.3996/JFWM-21-013,1944-687X,20,123,263,1747,3,15,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,"Assessing genomic and ecological differentiation among subspecies of the rough-footed mud turtle, Kinosternon hirtipes","Combining genetic and ecological measures of differentiation can provide compelling evidence for ecological and genetic divergence among lineages. The rough-footed mud turtle, Kinosternon hirtipes, is distributed from the Trans-Pecos region of Texas to the highlands of Central Mexico and contains 6 described subspecies, 5 of which are extant. We use ddRAD sequencing and species distribution models to assess levels of ecological and genetic differentiation among these subspecies. We also predict changes in climatically suitable habitat under different climate change scenarios and assess levels of genetic diversity and inbreeding within each lineage. Our results show that there is strong genetic and ecological differentiation among multiple lineages within K. hirtipes, and that this differentiation appears to be the result of vicariance associated with the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.

JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,Demographic inference provides insights into the extirpation and ecological dominance of eusocial snapping shrimps,"Although eusocial animals often achieve ecological dominance in the ecosystems where they occur, many populations are unstable, resulting in local extinction. Both patterns may be linked to the characteristic demography of eusocial species-high reproductive skew and reproductive division of labor support stable effective population sizes that make eusocial groups more competitive in some species, but also lower effective population sizes that increase susceptibility to population collapse in others. Here, we examine the relationship between demography and social organization in Synalpheus snapping shrimps, a group in which eusociality has evolved recently and repeatedly. We show using coalescent demographic modeling that eusocial species have had lower but more stable effective population sizes across 100,000 generations. Our results are consistent with the idea that stable population sizes may enable competitive dominance in eusocial shrimps, but they also suggest that recent population declines are likely caused by eusocial shrimps' heightened sensitivity to environmental changes, perhaps as a result of their low effective population sizes and localized dispersal. Thus, although the unique life histories and demography of eusocial shrimps have likely contributed to their persistence and ecological dominance over evolutionary time scales, these social traits may also make them vulnerable to contemporary environmental change.",crustacean; ddRAD; effective population size; eusociality; historical demography; MOMI2,2022,113,5,10.1093/jhered/esac035,0022-1503,14,114,199,1449,6,10,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF HEREDITY,Extensive genome introgression between domestic ferret and European polecat during population recovery in Great Britain,"The European polecat (Mustela putorius) is a mammalian predator which occurs across much of Europe east to the Ural Mountains. In Great Britain, following years of persecution the range of the European polecat contracted and by the early 1900s was restricted to unmanaged forests of central Wales. The European polecat has recently undergone a population increase due to legal protection and its range now overlaps that of feral domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo). During this range expansion, European polecats hybridized with feral domestic ferrets producing viable offspring. Here, we carry out population-level whole-genome sequencing on 8 domestic ferrets, 19 British European polecats, and 15 European polecats from the European mainland. We used a range of population genomics methods to examine the data, including phylogenetics, phylogenetic graphs, model-based clustering, phylogenetic invariants, ABBA-BABA tests, topology weighting, and Fst. We found high degrees of genome introgression in British polecats outside their previous stronghold, even in those individuals phenotyped as ``pure{'' polecats. These polecats ranged from presumed F1 hybrids (gamma = 0.53) to individuals that were much less introgressed (gamma = 0.2).

We tested each to determine their component breeds and used admixture analysis to ascertain their population structure. We utilized haplotype analysis to identify genomic regions shared between each population and their founding breeds. Our data show that the Alaskan Malamutes and modern Greenland sled dog contributed to both populations, but there are also unexpected contributions from the German Shepherd dog and Collie. We used haplotype analysis to identify genomic regions nearing fixation in population type and identify provocative genes in each region. Finally, in response to recent reports regarding the importance of dietary lipid genes in Arctic dogs, we analyzed 8 such genes in a targeted analysis observing signatures of selection in both populations at the MLXIPL gene loci.

JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,Morphological variation of the maxilla in modern humans and African apes,"Differences in morphology among modern humans and African apes are frequently used when assessing whether hominin fossils should be attributed to a single species or represent evidence for taxic diversity. A good understanding of the degree and structure of the intergeneric, interspecific, and intraspecific variation, including aspects such as sexual dimorphism and age, are key in this context. Here we explore the variation and differences shown by the maxilla of extant hominines, as maxillary morphology is central in the diagnosis of several hominin taxa. Our sample includes adults of all currently recognized hominine species and subspecies, with a balanced species sex ratio. In addition, we compared the adults with a small sample of late juveniles. The morphology of the maxillae was captured using threedimensional landmarks, and the size and shape were analyzed using geometric morphometric methods. Key observations are that 1) the maxillae of all extant hominine species and subspecies show statistically significant differences, but complete separation in shape is only seen at the genus level; 2) the degree of variation is not consistent between genera, with subspecies of Gorilla being more different from each other than are species of Pan; 3) the pattern of sexual shape dimorphism is different in Pan, Gorilla, and Homo, often showing opposite trends; and 4) differentiation between maxillary shapes is increased after adjustment for static intraspecific allometry. These results provide a taxonomically up-todate comparative morphological framework to help interpret the hominin fossil record, and we discuss the practical implications in that context.

JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,Morphological modularity in the anthropoid axial skeleton,"Previous research has found that hominoids have stronger modularity between limb elements than other anthropoids, suggesting that there is less constraint on morphological diversification (e.g., limb proportions) in hominoids in terms of evolutionary independence. However, degrees of modularity in the axial skeleton have not been investigated across a broad range of anthropoid taxa. Thus, it is unknown whether hominoids also have stronger modularity in the axial skeleton than other anthropoids, which has implications for the evolution of diverse torso morphologies in Miocene apes as well as the evolution of novel characteristics in the skull and vertebrae of fossil hominins. In this study, 12 anthropoid genera were sampled to examine degrees of modularity between axial skeletal elements (i.e., cranium, mandible, vertebrae, and sacrum). Covariance ratio coefficients were calculated using variance/covariance matrices of interlandmark distances for each axial skeletal element to evaluate degrees of modularity. The results showed that Alouatta, Hylobates, Gorilla, Pan, and Homo showed generally stronger modularity than other anthropoid taxa when considering all axial skeletal elements. When only considering the vertebral elements (i.e., vertebrae and sacrum), Alouatta, Hylobates, Gorilla, and Pan showed generally stronger modularity than other anthropoid taxa. Humans showed stronger modularity between the skull and vertebrae than other hominoids. Thus, the evolution of novel characteristics in the skull and vertebral column may have been less constrained in fossil hominins due to the dissociation of trait covariation between axial skeletal elements in hominoid ancestors, thus fostering more evolutionary independence between the skull and vertebral column.

JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,"Feeding ecology of the last European colobine monkey, Dolichopithecus ruscinensis","Currently, very little is known about the ecology of extinct Eurasian cercopithecids. Dietary information is crucial in understanding the ecological adaptations and diversity of extinct cercopithecids and the evolution of this family. For example, the colobine genus Dolichopithecus is represented by multiple large-bodied species that inhabited Eurasia during the Pliocene-Early Pleistocene. The available evidence, though limited, suggests semiterrestrial locomotion, which contrasts with most extant African and Asian colobines that exhibit morphological and physiological adaptations for arboreality and folivory. These differences raise questions regarding the dietary specialization of early colobine taxa and how/if that influenced their dispersion out of Africa and into Eurasia. To further our understanding of the ecology of Plio-Pleistocene cercopithecids, we characterized the dental capabilities and potential dietary adaptations of Dolichopithecus ruscinensis through dental topographic and enamel thickness analyses on an M1 from the locality of Serrat d'en Vacquer, Perpignan (France). We also assessed the feeding behavior of D. ruscinensis through dental microwear texture analysis on a broad sample of fossil molars from fossil sites in France, Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania. Dental topographic and enamel thickness analyses suggest that D. ruscinensis could efficiently process a wide range of foods. Results of the dental microwear texture analysis suggest that its diet ranged from folivory to the consumption of more mechanically challenging foods. Collectively, this suggests a more opportunistic feeding behavior for Dolichopithecus than characteristic of most extant colobines. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,"Morphological affinities of a fossil ulna (KNM-WS 65401) from Buluk, Kenya","The morphological affinities of a primate proximal ulna (KNM-WS 65401) recovered from the late Early Miocene site Buluk, Kenya, are appraised. Nineteen three-dimensional landmarks on ulnae from 36 extant anthropoid species (n 1/4 152 individuals) and KNM-WS 65401, as well as a subset of 14 landmarks on six ulnae belonging to other East African Miocene catarrhine taxa, were collected. To quantify ulnar shape, three-dimensional geometric morphometric techniques were used and linear dimensions commonly cited in the literature were derived from the landmark data. KNM-WS 65401 is situated between monkeys and hominoids in the principal components morphospace. KNM-WS 65401 shares features such as a short olecranon process, broad trochlear notch, and laterally oriented radial notch with extant hominoids, whereas features such as an anteriorly directed trochlear notch and flat, proximodistally elongated, and anteroposteriorly narrow radial notch are shared with extant monkeys. Principal component scores and linear metrics generally align KNM-WS 65401 with both suspensors and arboreal quadrupeds, but quadratic and linear discriminant analyses of principal component score data provide posterior probabilities of 80\% and 83\%, respectively, for assignment of KNM-WS 65401 to the suspensory group. Compared with fossil ulnae from other Miocene primates, KNM-WS 65401 is morphologically most distinct from KNM-LG 6, attributed to Dendropithecus macinnesi, and morphologically most similar to KNM-WK 16950R, attributed to Turkanapithecus kalakolensis.

JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,Comparative description and taxonomic affinity of 3.7-million-year-old hominin mandibles from Woranso-Mille (Ethiopia),"Fossil discoveries of early Australopithecus species from Woranso-Mille have played a significant role in improving our understanding of mid-Pliocene hominin evolution and diversity. Here, we describe two mandibles with dentitions, recovered from sediments immediately above a tuff radiometrically dated to 3.76 +/- 0.02 Ma, and assess their taxonomic affinity. The two mandibles (MSD-VP-5/16 and MSD-VP-5/50) show morphological similarities with both Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis. Some of the unique features that distinguish Au. anamensis from Au. afarensis are present in the mandibles, which also share a few derived features with Au. afarensis. Their retention of more Kanapoi Au. anamensis-like traits, compared to the fewer derived features they share with Au. afarensis, and the presence of Au. anamensis at Woranso-Mille in 3.8-million-year-old deposits, lends support to their assignment to Au. anamensis. However, it is equally arguable that the few derived dentognathic features they share with Au. afarensis could be taxonomically more significant, making it difficult to conclusively assign these specimens to either species. Regardless of which species they are assigned to, the mosaic nature of the dentognathic morphology and geological age of the two mandibles lends further support to the hypothesized ancestor-descendant relationship between Au. anamensis and Au. afarensis. However, there is now limited fossil evidence indicating that these two species may have overlapped in time. Hence, the last appearance of Au. anamensis and first appearance of Au. afarensis are currently unknown. Recovery of Australopithecus fossils from 4.1 to 3.8 Ma is critical to further address the timing of these events. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION,"Morphological integration and evolutionary potential of the primate shoulder: Variation among taxa and implications for genetic covariances with the basicranium, pelvis, and arm","Within the primate order, the morphology of the shoulder girdle is immensely variable and has been shown to reflect the functional demands of the upper limb. The observed morphological variation among extant primate taxa consequently has been hypothesized to be driven by selection for different functional demands. Evolutionary analyses of the shoulder girdle often assess this anatomical region, and its traits, individually, therefore implicitly assuming independent evolution of the shoulder girdle. However, the primate shoulder girdle has developmental and functional covariances with the basicranium and pelvic girdle that have been shown to potentially influence its evolution. It is unknown whether these relationships are similar or even present across primate taxa, and how they may affect morphological variation among primates. This study evaluates the strength of covariance and evolutionary potential across four anatomical regions: shoulder girdle, basicranium, pelvis, and distal humerus. Measures of morphological integration and evolutionary potential (conditioned covariance and evolutionary flexi-bility) are assessed across eight anthropoid primate taxa. Results demonstrate a consistent pattern of morphological constraint within paired anatomical regions across primates. Differences in evolutionary flexibility are observed among primate genera, with humans having the highest evolutionary potential overall. This pattern does not follow functional differences, but rather a separation between monkeys and apes. Therefore, evolutionary hypotheses of primate shoulder girdle morphological variation that evaluate functional demands alone may not account for the effect of these relationships. Collectively, our findings suggest differences in genetic covariance among anatomical regions may have contributed to the observable morphological variation among taxa. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,"A Closer Look at Non-random Patterns Within Chemistry Space for a Smaller, Earlier Amino Acid Alphabet","Recent findings, in vitro and in silico, are strengthening the idea of a simpler, earlier stage of genetically encoded proteins which used amino acids produced by prebiotic chemistry. These findings motivate a re-examination of prior work which has identified unusual properties of the set of twenty amino acids found within the full genetic code, while leaving it unclear whether similar patterns also characterize the subset of prebiotically plausible amino acids. We have suggested previously that this ambiguity may result from the low number of amino acids recognized by the definition of prebiotic plausibility used for the analysis. Here, we test this hypothesis using significantly updated data for organic material detected within meteorites, which contain several coded and non-coded amino acids absent from prior studies. In addition to confirming the well-established idea that ``late{''} arriving amino acids expanded the chemistry space encoded by genetic material, we find that a prebiotically plausible subset of coded amino acids generally emulates the patterns found in the full set of 20, namely an exceptionally broad and even distribution of volumes and an exceptionally even distribution of hydrophobicities (quantified as logP) over a narrow range. However, the strength of this pattern varies depending on both the size and composition the library used to create a background (null model) for a random alphabet, and the precise definition of exactly which amino acids were present in a simpler, earlier code. Findings support the idea that a small sample size of amino acids caused previous ambiguous results, and further improvements in meteorite analysis, and/or prebiotic simulations will further clarify the nature and extent of unusual properties. We discuss the case of sulfur-containing amino acids as a specific and clear example and conclude by reviewing the potential impact of better understanding the chemical ``logic{''} of a smaller forerunner to the standard amino acid alphabet.",Amino acids; Computational chemistry; Evolution; Abiogenesis Chemistry space,2022,90,3-Apr,10.1007/s00239-022-10061-5,0022-2844,16,102,304,2018,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,A Simple Evolutionary Model of Genetic Robustness After Gene Duplication,"When a dispensable gene is duplicated (referred to the ancestral dispensability denoted by O+), genetic buffering and duplicate compensation together maintain the duplicate redundancy, whereas duplicate compensation is the only mechanism when an essential gene is duplicated (referred to the ancestral essentiality denoted by O-). To investigate these evolutionary scenarios of genetic robustness, I formulated a simple mixture model for analyzing duplicate pairs with one of the following states: double dispensable (DD), semi-dispensable (one dispensable one essential, DE), or double essential (EE). This model was applied to the yeast duplicate pairs from a whole-genome duplication (WGD) occurred about 100 million years ago (mya), and the mouse duplicate pairs from a WGD occurred about more than 500 mya. Both case studies revealed that the proportion of essentiality for those duplicates with ancestral essentiality {[}P-E(O-)] was much higher than that for those with ancestral dispensability {[}P-E(O+)]. While it was negligible in the yeast duplicate pairs, P-E(O+) (about 20\%) was shown statistically significant in the mouse duplicate pairs. These findings, together, support the hypothesis that both sub-functionalization and neo-functionalization may play some roles after gene duplication, though the former may be much faster than the later.",Genetic robustness; Gene duplication; Essentiality; Dispensability; Genetic buffering,2022,90,5,10.1007/s00239-022-10065-1,0022-2844,10,72,193,1359,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

MCTPs are associated with endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum and possess three C2 domains (C2A-C2C) and two transmembrane regions (TMRs) well conserved in different species. Here, we generated structural models of the MCTP C2 domains of C. elegans and analyzed their putative function by docking, which revealed that these domains possess Ca2+- and lipid-binding pockets, suggesting that MCTPs play a significant, calcium-dependent role in membrane physiology.",C2 domain; Calcium signaling; Docking; Membrane traffic,2022,90,3-Apr,10.1007/s00239-022-10057-1,0022-2844,22,144,99,709,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,Context-Dependent Substitution Dynamics in Plastid DNA Across a Wide Range of Taxonomic Groups,"The influence of neighboring base composition, or context, on substitution bias at fourfold degenerate coding sites and in intergenic regions in plastid DNA is compared across the angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns, liverworts, chlorophytes, stramenopiles and rhodophytes. An influence of flanking base G + C content on the relative rates of transitions and transversions is observed in all lineages and extends up to four nucleotides from the site of substitution in some. Despite finding context effects in all lineages, significant differences were observed between lineages. Overall, the data suggest that context is a general factor affecting mutation bias in plastid DNA but that the dynamics of the influence have evolved over time. It is also shown that, although there are similar effects of context on substitution bias at fourfold degenerate coding sites and at sites within intergenic regions, there are also small but significant differences, suggesting that there could be some selection on some of these sites and that there could be some difference in the mutation and/or repair process between coding and noncoding DNA.",Mutation; Genome evolution; Context dependency; Chloroplast DNA; Transition bias; Flanking base content,2022,90,1,10.1007/s00239-021-10040-2,0022-2844,13,94,173,1133,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,Cost-Efficiency Optimization Serves as a Conserved Mechanism that Promotes Osteosarcoma in Mammals,"Mutations that reduce the biosynthetic cost of ATP production or increase the gene translation efficiency (tAI) are favorable for rapid cell growth and proliferation and therefore likely to be observed in tumors. Whether the mutations in tumors optimize the trade-off between the ATP biosynthesis cost and gene translation efficiency by increasing the tAI/ATP ratio is currently unknown. We retrieved transcriptome data of normal and osteosarcoma tissue samples from humans and mice and identified tumor-specific mutations in each species by using stringent cutoffs and outgroup information. We compared the tAI/ATP values of genes before and after mutation. The tAI/ATP profile was found to be highly conserved in humans and mice, and also correlated with the essentiality of genes. Tumor-specific rather than shared mutations were found to lead to increased tAI/ATP values in both species. Thus, tumor-specific mutations were found to optimize the cost-efficiency trade-off by increasing the tAI/ATP ratio of genes in osteosarcoma. This may indicate an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that promotes tumorigenesis by facilitating rapid cell growth and proliferation.",Osteosarcoma; Mutation; Cost-efficiency; tAI; ATP; Optimization; Evolutionary conservation,2022,90,1,10.1007/s00239-022-10047-3,0022-2844,12,98,169,1170,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,Domain Evolution of Vertebrate Blood Coagulation Cascade Proteins,"Vertebrate blood coagulation is controlled by a cascade containing more than 20 proteins. The cascade proteins are found in the blood in their zymogen forms and when the cascade is triggered by tissue damage, zymogens are activated and in turn activate their downstream proteins by serine protease activity. In this study, we examined proteomes of 21 chordates, of which 18 are vertebrates, to reveal the modular evolution of the blood coagulation cascade. Additionally, two Arthropoda species were used to compare domain arrangements of the proteins belonging to the hemolymph clotting and the blood coagulation cascades. Within the vertebrate coagulation protein set, almost half of the studied proteins are shared with jawless vertebrates. Domain similarity analyses revealed that there are multiple possible evolutionary trajectories for each coagulation protein. During the evolution of higher vertebrate clades, gene and genome duplications led to the formation of other coagulation cascade proteins.",Blood coagulation; Protein domains; Modular evolution; Hemolymph clotting,2022,90,6,10.1007/s00239-022-10071-3,0022-2844,8,65,147,1006,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,Emergence of Avian coronavirus Escape Mutants Under Suboptimal Antibody Titers,"To perform a quasispecies assessment of the effect of vaccine combinations and antibody titers on the emergence of Avian coronavirus (AvCoV) escape mutants, 5-week-old males from a commercial chicken breeder lineage were vaccinated intramuscularly with one dose of a monovalent (genotype GI-1) or a bivalent (genotypes GI-1 and GI-11 (n = 40 birds/group) AvCoV vaccine. Seven birds were kept as controls. Six weeks later, pools of sera of each group were prepared and incubated at virus neutralization doses of 10 and 10(-1) with the Beaudette strain (GI-1) of AvCoV in VERO cells. Rescued viruses were then submitted to genome-wide deep sequencing for subconsensus variant detection. After treatment with serum from birds vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine at a titer of 10(-1), an F307I variant was detected in the spike glycoprotein that mapped to an important neutralizing region, which indicated an escape mutant derived from natural selection. Further variants were detected in nonstructural proteins and non-coding regions that are not targets of neutralizing antibodies and might be indicators of genetic drift. These results indicate that the evolution of AvCoV escape mutants after vaccination depends on the type of vaccine strain and the antibody titer and must be assessed based on quasispecies rather than consensus dominant sequences only because quasispecies may be otherwise undetected.",Coronavirus; Vaccine; Escape mutant; Quasispecies,2022,90,2,10.1007/s00239-022-10050-8,0022-2844,10,78,212,1405,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,Evolution of DNA Methylation Across Ecdysozoa,"DNA methylation is a crucial, abundant mechanism of gene regulation in vertebrates. It is less prevalent in many other metazoan organisms and completely absent in some key model species, such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. We report here a comprehensive study of the presence and absence of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in 138 Ecdysozoa, covering Arthropoda, Nematoda, Priapulida, Onychophora, and Tardigrada. Three of these phyla have not been investigated for the presence of DNA methylation before. We observe that the loss of individual DNMTs independently occurred multiple times across ecdysozoan phyla. We computationally predict the presence of DNA methylation based on CpG rates in coding sequences using an implementation of Gaussian Mixture Modeling, MethMod. Integrating both analysis we predict two previously unknown losses of DNA methylation in Ecdysozoa, one within Chelicerata (Mesostigmata) and one in Tardigrada. In the early-branching Ecdysozoa Priapulus caudatus, we predict the presence of a full set of DNMTs and the presence of DNA methylation.

JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION,Evolutionary History of TOPIIA Topoisomerases in Animals,"TOPIIA topoisomerases are required for the regulation of DNA topology by DNA cleavage and re-ligation and are important targets of antibiotic and anticancer agents. Humans possess two TOPIIA paralogue genes (TOP2A and TOP2B) with high sequence and structural similarity but distinct cellular functions. Despite their functional and clinical relevance, the evolutionary history of TOPIIA is still poorly understood. Here we show that TOPIIA is highly conserved in Metazoa. We also found that TOPIIA paralogues from jawed and jawless vertebrates had different origins related with tetraploidization events. After duplication, TOP2B evolved under a stronger purifying selection than TOP2A, perhaps promoted by the more specialized role of TOP2B in postmitotic cells. We also detected genetic signatures of positive selection in the highly variable C-terminal domain (CTD), possibly associated with adaptation to cellular interactions. By comparing TOPIIA from modern and archaic humans, we found two amino acid substitutions in the TOP2A CTD, suggesting that TOP2A may have contributed to the evolution of present-day humans, as proposed for other cell cycle-related genes. Finally, we identified six residues conferring resistance to chemotherapy differing between TOP2A and TOP2B. These six residues could be targets for the development of TOP2A-specific inhibitors that would avoid the side effects caused by inhibiting TOP2B. Altogether, our findings clarify the origin, diversification and selection pressures governing the evolution of animal TOPIIA.",TOP2A; TOP2B; Metazoan phylogeny; Selection; Archaic humans; Anticancer drugs,2022,90,2,10.1007/s00239-022-10048-2,0022-2844,7,56,220,1553,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

ABC transporters in insects are found within large multigene families involved in the efflux of chemical insecticides and toxic/undesired metabolites originating from food and endogenous metabolism. This review deals with ABC transporter subfamilies of few agronomically important Lepidopteran pests. The transcriptional dynamics and regulation of ABC transporters during insect development emphasizes their functional diversity against insecticides, Cry toxins, and plant specialized metabolites. To generate insights about molecular function and physiological roles of ABCs, functional and structural characterization is necessary.

We examined gene expression profiles of Asiatic toads (Bufo gargarizans) along an elevational gradient from both wild and common-garden acclimated populations. Asiatic toads originated from high altitudes have distinctive gene expression patterns. We identified 18 fixed differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which are different in both wild and acclimated samples, and 1217 plastic DEGs, which are different among wild samples. The expression levels of most genes were linearly correlated with altitude gradient and down-regulated in high-altitude populations. Expression variations of several genes associated with metabolic process are fixed, and we also identified a co-expression module that is significantly different between acclimated populations and has functions related to DNA repair. The differential expression of the vast majority genes, however, are due to phenotypic plasticity, revealing the highly plastic nature of gene expression variations.

Exotic Ambrosia artemisiifolia is an invasive and mycorrhizal plant species. A long-term field experiment was conducted to examine the differences in AMF diversity and composition in the roots of A. artemisiifolia and Setaria viridis subjected to interspecific competition during growth. A greenhouse experiment was also performed to test the effect of Funneliformis mosseae on the growth of these two species. Ambrosia artemisiifolia invasion caused AMF diversity to change in native S. viridis roots. Meanwhile, the relative abundance of F. mosseae was significantly higher in the roots of A. artemisiifolia than in those of S. viridis. The higher AMF colonization rate in the exotic species (A. artemisiifolia) than in the native species (S. viridis) was found in both the field and greenhouse experiments.

Thus, relationships between PPT and productivity can provide insight into how changes in climate may alter ecosystem functions globally. Spatial PPT-ANPP relationships for grasslands are found remarkably similar around the world, but whether and how they change during periods of extended climatic anomalies remain unknown. Here, we quantified how regional-scale PPT-ANPP relationships vary between an extended wet and a dry period by taking advantage of a 35-year record of PPT and NDVI (as a surrogate for ANPP) at 1700 sites in the temperate grasslands of northern China. We found a sharp decrease in the strength of the spatial PPT-ANPP relationship during an 11-year period of below average PPT.

JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,Biotic effects dominate the inter-annual variability in ecosystem carbon exchange in a Tibetan alpine meadow,"The alpine meadow ecosystem in Tibet is fragile and sensitive, and its carbon sink function with respect to climate change has become a matter of widespread concern. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the inter-annual variations (IAVs) in the carbon fluxes in an alpine meadow and to further quantify the contributions of the driving factors to the IAVs. Based on 7 years of flux data (2012-2018) and the corresponding climatic and biotic data, a set of look-up tables was used to separate and quantify the IAV sources. Furthermore, linear perturbation analyses were employed to quantify the contributions of each key factor. During 2012-2018, the net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) of this alpine meadow were 3.31 +/- 26.90, 210.18 +/- 48.35 and 206.88 +/- 28.45 g C m(-2) y(-1), respectively, which indicated relatively large IAVs. When the contributions of climatic and biotic effects were distinguished and quantified, the dominant effects of biotic factors emerged. Additionally, negative interactions between climatic and biotic effects were detected. Among the climatic factors, only soil water content contributed relatively more to the IAVs and played a role in regulating the interactions between climatic and biotic effects.

However, the number of connected ramet generations that benefit from clonal integration in a clonal system has received relatively little attention. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the extent of physiological integration within the clonal system of Vallisneria natans consisting of a mother ramet and three sequentially connected offspring ramets. Mother ramets were grown in full sunlight, and offspring ramets were heavily shaded with limited light availability. Stolons between mother ramets and offspring ramets were severed or connected, but connection among the three offspring ramets remained. The photosynthetic ability of unshaded mother ramets of V. natans was significantly enhanced, but their biomass accumulation was greatly reduced when connected to shaded offspring ramets. Clonal integration significantly increased biomass accumulation, C and N availabilities, extracellular enzyme activities and microbial biomass of the first ramet generation (adjacent ramet), but not later ramet generations. Our results indicate that support from the mother ramet of V. natans may be limited to the adjacent offspring ramet in a clonal system under severe light stress, implying an effect of ramet generation.

Although they play an irreplaceable ecological role in the forest, less is known about their eco-physiological status, and how their photosynthesis-related functional traits differ from those of co-occurring vascular plants. We determined the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and stoichiometric ratios, tissue mass per area, chlorophyll concentrations and photosynthetic light-response curves of three lichens, three mosses and four vascular plants in a subalpine forest in the eastern Tibetan Plateau of China. Trait values were compared among and within each group. The lichens possessed a higher nitrogen concentration than that of mosses. In addition, the two poikilohydric groups exhibited lower concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll, light-saturated assimilation rates and photosynthetic nutrient use efficiencies, and higher light compensation points than those of vascular plant leaves. Furthermore, variations in photosynthesis-related traits for lichen species reflect their different adaptation strategies to their corresponding environments. In contrast, the differences were weak among the three forest-floor mosses and the three herb species. These results demonstrate that the high abundance of understory lichens and mosses in the high-elevation subalpine forest cannot be explained by the photosynthesis-related traits.",chlorophyll; functional trait; lichen; moss; nutrient; understory,2022,15,4,10.1093/jpe/rtab109,1752-9921,17,140,199,1488,6,14,250,7,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,Fisher discriminant analysis method applied in drought detection: an instance in an alpine meadow ecosystem,"Fisher discriminant analysis can comprehensively take multiple factors into consideration and effectively conduct separations between two classes. If it can be used to detect the occurrences of drought, drought can be detected more effectively and accurately. Based on 9-year carbon flux and corresponding meteorological data, soil water content (SWC) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were selected as the discriminant factors. Drought occurrences were detected by applying the Fisher discriminant analysis method in an alpine ecosystem in Tibet. Fisher discriminant analysis was successfully applied to detect drought occurrence in an alpine meadow ecosystem. The soil water deficit and atmospheric water deficit were comprehensively taken into consideration. Consequently, this method could detect the onset and end date of droughts more accurately and reasonably. Based on the characteristics of drought and non-drought samples, the discriminant equation was constructed as y = 24.46SWC - 4.60VPD. When y > 1, the days were distributed above the critical line. In addition, when y was greater than one for more than 10 days, it was labeled as one drought event. If the interval between two drought processes was less than 2 days, it was considered one drought event. With increasing the study period and continued accumulation of observation data, the discriminant equation could be further optimized in the future, resulting in more accurate drought detection.",soil water; VPD; GPP; alpine meadow; Tibetan Plateau,2022,15,5,10.1093/jpe/rtac007,1752-9921,15,107,218,1464,5,14,250,7,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,Genetic diversity and population structure of invasive and native populations of Erigeron canadensis L.,"Invasive alien plants threaten biodiversity across the world. Erigeron canadensis (horseweed) is one of the most problematic agricultural weeds and represents a classic example of intercontinental invasion. Here, we studied the genetic diversity and population structure of invasive alien populations from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces in China and native populations from Alabama, in the USA. We used 10 polymorphic SSR loci to genotype 312 individuals from 5 native and 5 invasive populations to estimate the genetic diversity and structure. Invasive populations from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces showed, on average, similar genetic diversity to native populations from Alabama, indicating no severe genetic bottlenecks during the invasion. STRUCTURE revealed that low population differentiation occurred, and that only two genetic groupings were detected in both native and invaded ranges. The high diversity observed in the invasive populations suggested multiple introductions and/or the introduction of genetically diverse propagules during initial colonization. Our study provides new insights toward understanding the invasion dynamics of this globally noxious weed in Eastern China. Preventing gene flow via seed dispersal between invasive and native populations should be examined to prevent the introduction and dispersal of herbicide-resistant individuals and inform management practices.",gene flow; genetic diversity; invasive alien plant; introduced population; native population,2022,15,4,10.1093/jpe/rtac016,1752-9921,14,103,193,1407,5,14,250,7,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,Variability and correlation of selected soil attributes and maize yield influenced by tillage systems in mountainous agroecosystem,"Soil and topographic variability severely influence agricultural productivity and food security in a mountainous agroecosystem. Understanding these soil spatial disparities are important to optimize suitable land use planning and adoption of appropriate conserva-tion practices to ensure sustainable agricultural productivity in mountainous regions. A field survey and sampling of 108 elevation sites were conducted to assess spatial dynamics and influence of prevalent tillage systems on selected soil attributes and on reported maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield (MGY) in mountainous valleys of Pakistan. Measured soil properties were effective soil depth (ESD), soil penetration resistance (SPR), soil bulk density (SBD), fraction of rock fragments (FRF), soil organic matter (SOM), and soil water holding capacity (SWHC). Additionally, the influence of three existing tillage systems-integrated tillage (IT), bullock tillage (BT), and tractor tillage (TT)-on soil properties and MGY were assessed. Research results showed that ESD, SPR, SBD, FRF, SOM, SWHC, and MGY varied from 15.0 to 40.0 cm, 180.0 to 278.0 psi, 0.9 to 1.7 g cm-3, 13.2\% to 43.5\%, 0.6\% to 2.9\%, 10.5\% to 35.6\%, and 4.1 to 10.2 t ha-1, respectively. Differences between soil parameters were signif-icant among the sampling sites studied. Soil properties were found to be strongly associated with each other and with the MGY and were grouped through Pearson correlation, principal component analysis, and heatmap. Moreover, significant variation of soil properties was noted due to the tillage systems adopted by the farmers. The ESD (26.8 cm), SOM (1.4\%), SWHC (16.9\%), and MGY (7.8 t ha-1) were the highest under IT while the SPR (262.8 psi), SBD (1.6 g cm-3), and FRF (38.0\%) were the greatest with TT compared to the other tillage sys-tems.

JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,Increased rainfall may place saline/sodic soils on the tipping point of sustainability,"Increased rainfall is increasing the risk of the capillary movement of sodium (Na+) and other salts from buried marine sediments to the soil surface in the North American northern Great Plains. These salts reduce productivity and resilience while increasing their effect on the environment. Understanding the interactions among management, climate, cropping system, and soil is the first step toward implementing effective management plans. Unfortunately, while much work has been conducted, little is known about the effective management of semiarid dryland saline/sodic soils. This study determined the influence of soil depth on hydraulic conductivity and changes in soil Na+ (mg Na+ kg(-1) soil) to electrical conductivity (EC1:1) (dS m(-1)) ratio following high spring rainfall in 2019 in three soils.The soil parent materials were Glaciolacrustrine underlaid at a depth of approximately 15 m by marine sediments that contained Na+ and other salts. The landscape positions included in the study were a well-drained shoulder, moderately well-drained backslope, and a poorly drained toeslope soil. Based on the soil classification, shoulder and backslope subsoils were not predicted to be salt affected, while the toeslope soil was predicted to contain a natric soil horizon. Rainfall in 2018, 2019, and 2020 was 46, 76, and 37 cm, respectively, and soil cores were collected prior to and following the 2019 high rainfall. Soil cores were separated into the 0 to 7.5, 50 to 57.5, 82.5 to 90, 92.5 to 100, and 105 to 112.5 cm segments. Samples from 2018 were analyzed for soil EC1:1, pH, ammonium acetate extractable cations, soil particle size, available water at field capacity, drainable porosity, soil bulk density, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Samples from 2019 were analyzed for EC1:1 and ammonium acetate extractable Na+. Across the sampling sites, shoulder and backslope soils had higher saturated hydraulic conductivities than the toeslope soils. Saturated hydraulic conductivities were negatively correlated to pH (r = -0.55, p < 0.01), the Na+ to EC1:1 ratio (r = -0.66, p < 0.01), extractable Na+ (r = -0.56, p < 0.01), and sand content (r = -0.66, p < 0.01), and positively correlated to the silt content (r = 0.65, p < 0.01). A comparison between the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the Na+ to EC1:1 ratio suggests that saturated conductivities approached 0 cm h(-1) when the Na+ (mg Na+ kg(-1)) to EC1:1 (dS m(-1)) ratio exceeded 600. The 2019 high rainfall increased the risk of soil dispersion in the lower soil depths (>82.5 cm). For example, in the shoulder soil at the 105 to 112.5 cm depth, EC1:1 decreased 0.936 +/- 0.254 dS m(-1) from 2018 to 2019, whereas the exchangeable Na+ increased 688 +/- 283 mg kg(-1) soil. Our findings suggest that a climate change-induced shift in rainfall patterns can increase salinity and sodicity risks in northern Great Plains subsurface soils.

JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,Capture of surface water runoff for irrigation of corn in western Illinois: Implications for nutrient loss reduction,"Supplemental irrigation with the runoff from agricultural fields (runoff irrigation) not only has the potential to reuse nutrients in agricultural runoff but could potentially reduce fertilizer input to farms, leading to reduced nutrient export from agricultural fields. A three-year field study designed to evaluate the impact of runoff irrigation on corn (Zea mays) yield and nutrient uptake was conducted in a farmer-operated field at the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) site in Fulton County, Illinois. The study comprised three treatments: (1) 50\% agronomic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer rates with no irrigation (control), (2) 50\% agronomic N and P fertilizer rates with irrigation, and (3) 100\% agronomic N and P fertilizer with no irrigation. Each treatment was assigned to a 76 m by 18 m plot, planted with corn in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Runoff irrigation increased grain, stover, and total dry matter yields by an average of 38\%, 45\%, and 27\%, respectively, as compared to the control. On average, 50\% agronomic fertilizer rate, coupled with runoff irrigation, produced similar grain yields as 100\% agronomic fertilizer rate. At the 50\% agronomic fertilizer rate, N uptake averaged 231 +/- 37 kg N ha(-1) in 2017 and 290 +/- 54 kg N ha(-1) in 2018 with irrigation, as compared to 162 +/- 36 kg N ha(-1) in 2017 and 179 +/- 34 kg N ha(-1) in 2018 without irrigation. Similarly, P uptake was greater with irrigation than without irrigation for the same P fertilizer rate.The fertilizer replacement value (FRV) of the runoff irrigation was estimated to be 73 kg N ha(-1) and 6 kg P ha(-1 )in 2018. This represents a potential of reducing N and P fertilizer application rate by 30\% and 8\%, respectively, by supplemental irrigation without reducing corn yield.The runoff irrigation is a potential best management practice that can be further explored for adoption in Illinois for contributing to the statewide Nutrient Loss Reduction Strategy.",corn yield; fertilizer replacement value; irrigation runoff; nutrient loss; nutrient uptake,2022,77,3,10.2489/jswc.2022.00060,0022-4561,17,116,320,2005,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,"Crop residue cover dynamics for wind erosion control in a dryland, no-till system","Among the benefits of crop residues is their influence on reducing soil wind erosion. Residue height, diameter, and soil surface cover influence wind speeds and soil susceptibility to wind erosion events. Understanding the role of crop residue type in maximizing residue coverage through time can inform management for improved residue retention, and wind erosion models for better simulation of the residue decomposition process. We used the Dryland Agroecosystem Project (DAP), a long-term, dryland, no-till systems experiment at multiple locations in eastern Colorado, to examine differences between winter annual grain and summer annual forage crop residue dynamics. The DAP utilizes wheat-based rotations plus continuously cropped grain-forage and forage-only rotations. For this study, we focused on residue dynamics of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) and forage crop (Sorghum bicolor and Setaria italica) residues at two locations in eastern Colorado and following two harvest seasons (2014 and 2015). Decomposition days (DD), a calculation that factors in temperature and rainfall to estimate cumulative conditions that favor decomposition, were used to normalize climate conditions across sites and years. Counts of postharvest standing stems, stem diameters, and residue heights were measured, as was soil surface coverage. Soil cover measurements were used to estimate the length of time before soil surface cover fell below a 30\% coverage threshold and to model residue persistence. Results showed that winter wheat consistently produced more residue cover immediately after harvest, and cover also persisted almost twice as long as forage crop residues. The hypothesis that residue cover could be represented using an exponential decay model was supported for forage sorghum and forage millet, while wheat residue maintained postharvest coverage of the soil for a period of time before beginning to decline and followed a quadratic decay model. The combined effects of standing stem density, initial residue cover, and coverage longevity point to wheat being a valuable protector against wind erosion in these systems. The different residue trajectories by crop type suggest that shifts in crop rotations within no-till management systems can have important implications for wind erosion control in the semiarid Great Plains.",forage; residue decomposition; semiarid cropping systems; soil surface cover; wheat,2022,77,3,10.2489/jSWC.2022.00005,0022-4561,13,81,341,2340,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,Cover crops and specialty crop agriculture: Exploring cover crop use among vegetable and fruit growers in Michigan and Ohio,"Cover crops???crops grown primarily to protect and improve soil???are widely considered to be an important component of sustainable agricultural systems because their use can provide multiple ecosystem services without compromising yields over time. Specialty crops???fruits, vegetables, and horticultural crops???are increasingly important to US agriculture and food security and uniquely vulnerable to climate-related problems that cover crops can help to address. Yet far less research has been conducted on cover crop use by farmers who grow mainly specialty crops, compared to the much larger body of research on farmers who principally grow row crops like corn (Zea mays) and soybeans (Glycine max). In this study, we draw on survey data from a stratified, random sample of 881 specialty crop growers in Michigan and Ohio to accomplish two main goals. First, we seek to characterize cover crop use among this important group of farmers, focusing on types of cover crop used and use of multiple types. Second, we examine the relationship between cover crop use on vegetable and fruit farms and key social and economic factors, with particular attention to farmers??? environmental values, adherence to organic principles, and sources of information. According to survey results, cover cropping is more likely when farmers (1) manage certified organic (p < 0.01) or organic-in-practice (p < 0.05) farms; (2) report being influenced by private crop consultants (p < 0.01); (3) attach high importance to agri-environmental goals (p < 0.01); and (4) grow vegetable crops instead of or in addition to fruit crops (p < 0.001). No relationship was found to exist between cover cropping and farmers??? concerns about climate-related risks, education level, or perceived self-efficacy. We conclude by suggesting that the importance of structural factors to farmers??? decisions about cover crops should not be underestimated. Promoting and strengthening the market for organic food may be the most direct pathway toward increasing the number of farmers who use cover crops. Historically important entities in agricultural networks, including cooperative extension and conservation nongovernmental organizations, might enhance their impact on cover crop use by forming new partnerships with private crop consultants.",cover crops; crop consultants; organic farming; specialty crops,2022,77,4,10.2489/jSWC.2022.00006,0022-4561,19,123,343,2311,4,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,cover crop-dryland farming-moisture-semiarid-soil health,"Cover crops are a sustainable management tool for mediating weed pressure, reducing soil erosion, and enhancing soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) levels. Yet, adoption rates across water-limited farms in Texas remain low, especially among producers without irrigation access, due to concerns that cover crop use of soil moisture will negatively impact subsequent cash crop yields. This three-year cover crop trial in a rain-fed sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) farm in Lyford, Texas, trialed different cover crop mixes and seeding rates and confirmed that cover cropping leads to significant soil moisture deficits and cash crop failure when rainfall is low between cover crop termination and cash crop planting (<30 mm). In seasons one and three, moisture deficits contributed to significantly lower germination of post???cover crop sorghum compared to fallow control plots. In season two, increased precipitation during a longer moisture recharge period between cover crop termination and cash crop planting helped avoid sorghum yield drops. Length of recharge period, amount of rainfall, species selection, planting density, and termination method are major determinants of subsequent cash crop outcomes. Careful management can minimize some of the risks cover cropping poses to soil moisture, but without reliable rainfall at key points in the cropping cycle, cover cropping remains risky for farmers without irrigation access.",cover crop; dryland farming; moisture; semiarid; soil health,2022,77,3,10.2489/jSWC.2022.00088,0022-4561,4,56,211,1434,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,Estimates of soil erosion and best management practice effectiveness at forestry stream crossings in North Carolina,"Approach ways of forest road and skid trail stream crossings can be direct pathways for sediment delivery to stream channels if not properly managed. Forestry best management practices (BMPs) can reduce erosion and sedimentation, but their effectiveness can vary by application. This study characterizes implemented stream crossing types and methods of access, and quantifies the effectiveness of BMPs implemented at 220 stream crossings in four ecoreg ions of North Carolina. We estimated soil erosion rate and quantity using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)-Forest methodology. Estimates of BMP effectiveness were explored by comparing on-site modeled estimates with modified modeled estimates that would be more discerning of no-BMP scenarios. Statewide, portable bridges and overland skid trails were the most frequently observed stream crossing type and access method, respectively. BMPs at stream crossings were properly implemented at a rate of 90.1\%. Although increased BMP implementation scores were significantly associated with decreasing erosion estimates, the relationship was weakly correlated (p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.08). There were no differences in modeled erosion rates by ecoregion (p = 0.2671). Statewide, overland skid trail crossings had lower modeled erosion rates than bladed skid trails (p = 0.0432) and haul roads (p = 0.0002). Erosion rates modeled at stream crossings when the tract had active operations were significantly higher compared to stream crossings on inactive/closed tracts (p < 0.0001).

JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,Management of nutrient export from diffuse sources in watersheds for environmental protection under uncertainty,"Nutrient export from diffuse sources poses a significant threat to watersheds, and methods to support the effective management of these watersheds is essential. However, real-world nutrient flows and watershed management systems are highly complex, with a high degree of uncertainty in their descriptive information. Thus, an effective optimization method for watershed management must be developed to deal with this uncertainty, which is crucial for formulating and implementing appropriate management practices. This research presents an inexact simulation-based left-hand-side chance-constrained mixed-integer programming (ISLCCMIP) model to determine nutrient export characteristics and optimal management strategies. By introducing interval and stochastic parameters into the simulation process, the uncertain characteristics of nutrient export loads can be considered. Uncertainties and complexities in management processes can also be handled through incorporating interval parameter programming and mixed-integer programming within a left-hand-side chance-constrained programming framework. The proposed ISLCCMIP model can correlate the randomness in the simulation process and the optimization results. The East River basin in South China was selected as the case study area to apply the proposed model. The results indicated that inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were the main forms for the nutrient export from diffuse sources in this basin. Five of the nine subbasins were identified as critical source areas for nutrient export. Planting areas of different crops, application amounts of chemical fertilizers, and quantities of livestock types can be optimized to achieve the maximum economic benefit under limited N and P discharge permits. Particularly, planting areas of vegetable and soybean (Glycine max L.) would be first decreased, while rice (Oryza sativa L.) and tubers would be retained, as the pollution emission standards become stricter. Decrease in the planting areas of soybean and vegetables would effectively decrease the violation risk under particular nutrient discharge standards. Concurrently, application amounts of N and P fertilizers and numbers of livestock and poultry should be reduced with stricter pollution discharge standards and increasing significance levels. Furthermore, several strategies correlated to multiple constraint-violation risks, and nutrient reduction scenarios were formulated. These results can provide alternatives for watershed decision-makers to balance increasing system economic benefits and decreasing diffuse source pollution. The proposed ISLCCMIP model can also be applied to other watersheds with similar concerns.",chance; constrained programming; interval parameter programming; mixed-integer programming; nutrient export from watersheds; optimization of agricultural production,2022,77,3,10.2489/jSWC.2022.00192,0022-4561,14,111,363,2694,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,?How can you put a price on the environment?? Farmer perspectives on stewardship and payment for ecosystem services,"As agricultural conservation priorities evolve to address new complex social -ecological problems and emerging social priorities, new conservation incentive program participation and success can be enhanced by incorporating local stakeholder preferences into program design. Our research explores how farmers incorporate ecosystem services into management decisions, their willingness to participate in payment for ecosystem services programs, and factors beyond compensation level that would influence participation. We conducted three focus groups with 24 participants between January of 2019 and May of 2019 in Vermont. Our study revealed that a strong, intrinsic stewardship ethic motivates farmers to enhance ecosystem service provisioning from their farms, though financial pressures often limit decision-making. These results suggest that programs with sufficient levels of payment may attract participation, at least among some types of farmers, to enhance ecosystem services from farms in Vermont. However, farmers may be deterred from participating by perceived unfairness and distrust of the government based on previous experiences with regulations and conservation incentive structures. Farmers also expressed distrust of information about ecosystem services supply that conflicts with their perceptions of agroecosystem functioning, unless delivered by trusted individuals from the extension system. The delivery of context -specific information on how management changes impact ecosystem service performance from trusted sources could enhance farmers??? decisions, and would aptly complement payments. Additionally, farmers expressed a desire to see a program that both achieves additionality and rewards farms who have been stewards, goals that are potentially at odds.

JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,No-till adoption by corn and soybean producers: An examination of tenure,"The widespread adoption of no-till can be explained by the range of on-farm ben-efits, including soil erosion control, soil moisture conservation, and reduced operating costs (e.g., labor, fuel, and tillage machinery). When used continuously as part of a suite of practices that minimize soil disturbance and maintain soil cover, there is evidence that no-till can help improve soil health. Therefore, there is continued interest in understanding the factors that affect no-till adoption, on a national scale, as they may contribute to improved conserva-tion program design. This article uses logit analysis of field-level data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey to identify factors that affect no-till adoption for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max {[}L.] Merr.) producers. Our results show effects of climate, farm size, irrigation use, crop rotation, and drainage (in corn fields) on no-till adoption that are generally consistent with the literature but do suggest some significant differences in determinants of no-till between corn and soybeans. Results also show that renters are more likely to use no-till in soybeans than in corn and that the estimated probability is much larger for share renters that for cash renters. The latter tenure effect differs from previous research and could have important implications for program design given there are more than twice as many cash renters as share renters in the United States.",cash rent; land tenure; no-till; share rent,2022,77,5,10.2489/jSWC.2022.00022,0022-4561,11,72,223,1458,4,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes

A standardized testing protocol was utilized at the Erosion Control Research and Training Center (ECRTC) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to evaluate SPBs. The testing protocol simulated sheet flow erosion from the construction sites in Illinois during a 10-year, 6-hour storm event. The silt fence was tested as a standard.

However, little is known about the changes in soil erodibility after removing the mulch layer. In this paper, we measured the physicochemical properties and aggregate characteris-tics of soil from an urban park after removing the mulch layer and estimated wind-erodible materials emission by wind tunnel experiments. Wood chips at 4,500 g m-2 (mulch thickness of 5 cm, R5), 6,300 g m-2 (mulch thickness of 7 cm, R7), and 8,100 g m-2 (mulch thickness of 9 cm, R9) were used for mulching an area in Yuanmingyuan Park from October of 2019 to the end of February of 2021. The following four treatments were listed: unmulched soil (CK), R5, R7, and R9. Compared with CK, the soil moisture content (SM), the macro -aggregates (>0.25 mm) ratio (M > 0.25), the wind erodible fraction (WEF), and the dry aggregate stability (DAS) of R5, R7, and R9 were significantly increased after mulching (P < 0.05), whereas the soil organic matter content (SOM) was only slightly increased. The calcium carbonate contents (CaCO3) varied greatly among the different treatments. Based on the wind tunnel experiments, the distribution of wind erosion materials near the soil surface (0 to 30 cm) was fitted to logarithmic, power, and exponential functions (R2 ranged between 0.7179 and 0.9859). The particle size distribution of all wind-erodible materials was unimodal, and the proportion of coarse particles (250 to 100 mu m) was highest.

JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,Physicochemical properties of biochar derived from wood of Gliricidia sepium based on the pyrolysis temperature and its,"Biochar (BC) represents biomass such as wood, grass, and manure, decomposed by pyrolysis typically produced under conditions of limited oxygen (O2) and low to moderate temperatures (<600??C). The application of BC to improve physicochemical properties of soil and boost plant growth is increasingly gaining attention. Most studies reporting the underlying mechanisms of BC-based soil improvement describe changes in water holding capacity based on the difference in the type of soil and intrinsic properties of the BCs. The physical and chemical properties of BC itself depend considerably on the pyrolysis temperature and the feedstock used for its production. Previous studies that investigated changes in soil physical properties due to pyrolysis at temperatures ranging between 200??C and 300??C described changes in soil water retention. In this study, we used Gliricidia sepium, a fast growth legume tree, as the feedstock for producing BC. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a wide range of pyrolysis temperatures (300??C to 800??C) on the physicochemical properties of BC derived from G. sepium wood, and thereafter evaluate the effect on soil physical properties in a pot incubation test with BC produced at 400??C and 800??C in sandy soil. The physicochemical properties of BCs generated from G. sepium wood changed considerably as the pyrolysis temperature increased. A significant increase in the carbon (C)/ nitrogen (N) ratio and pH of the BC was observed at elevated pyrolysis temperatures, which may be attributed to the high total C content of the generated ash. Biochar produced at 400??C showed the most promising results by enhancing the soil fertility based on its low bulk density and high cation exchange capacity. The water holding index is significantly negatively correlated to soil bulk density so the low bulk density of produced at 400??C helps improve the water holding capacity of sandy soil in this study. Consequently, BC produced at 400??C is the most promising soil conditioner for elevating soil fertility and the water holding index. can contribute energy biomass production on oligotrophic lands consequently reducing the",biochar-Gliricidia sepium-physical and chemical properties-pyrolysis- temperature-water holding capacity,2022,77,3,10.2489/jswc.2022.00083,0022-4561,17,119,336,2183,1,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,No-tillage and fertilizer-nitrogen improved sorghum yield in dryland wheat-sorghum- fallow rotation,"Grain crop rotations are common in temperate semiarid regions, but the effect of long-term tillage and fertilizer-nitrogen (N) rate interaction on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench ssp. Bicolor) grain yield in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-sorghum-fallow rotation is not well understood. This study was conducted from 2015 to 2020 using long-term plots established in 1965. Experimental design was randomized complete block with split-plot arrangement of treatments. Main plots were conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-tillage (NT), and subplots treatments were 0, 45, 90, and 135 kg N ha-1. Tillage x N rate and year x tillage x N rate interactions had no effect on grain yield, but yield was greatest with NT in 2016 and unaffected by tillage in other years. The year x N rate had significant effect on grain yield because of no response to N fertilizer in 2015 and greater responses from 2018 to 2020. Across years and tillage treatments, mean grain yield increased quadratically by 52\%, 70\%, and 83\% as N rate increased from 0 to 45, 90, and 135 kg ha-1, respectively. On average, grain yield, N agronomic efficiency (NAE), and grain N recovery efficiency (GNRE) were 6\%, 20\%, and 15\% greater, respectively, under NT compared with CT and RT. Quadratic models explained yield response to N rate and growing season pre-cipitation for each tillage practice. Grain yield increases per growing season precipitation were 22.9, 14.9, and 11.9 kg ha-1 mm-1 with NT, CT, and RT, respectively. Fertilizer-N application increased sorghum grain yield and protein concentration, but NAE and GNRE decreased beyond 45 kg ha-1 N. In conclusion, NT is the best management practice to increase grain sorghum yield, NAE, and NRE in nonirrigated winter wheat-sorghum-fallow rotations.",agronomic efficiency; fertilizer application; nutrient use; rotation; tillage,2022,77,6,10.2489/jSWC.2022.00241,0022-4561,11,99,285,1803,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,Comparison of infiltration test methods for soil health assessment,"Infiltration rate (IR) has been commonly used as a metric to evaluate soil quality and health. For the USDA Soil Quality Test Kit, a 15 cm (6 in) diameter cylinder is used to measure IR with 444 cm3 (equivalent to 2.54 cm {[}1 in]) of water while other standard IR procedures require substantially larger volumes of water. The general objective of this study was to compare different methods for IR measurement. Using three replications, IR mea-surements were conducted along a 9 m (27 ft) long transect in two different soil types by the double-ring infiltrometer (DRI) using 25 and 50 cm (10 and 20 in, respectively) cylinders, single-ring infiltrometer (SRI) using 25 and 50 cm cylinders, Cornell sprinkle infiltrometer (CSI) using a 24.1 cm (9.5 in) cylinder, the USDA recommended procedure using a 15 cm diameter cylinder (hereafter referred to as USDA-15 method), and a modified USDA method using a 24.1 cm diameter cylinder. Although the USDA-15 method is simple and requires a small amount of water, the procedure does not offer an accurate estimate of the soil infiltration potential due to high variability among replications and significant reduction in IR during early stages of water entry into the soil. The CSI procedure was reproducible, but it is more cumbersome to perform than other methods. The DRI, SRI, and CSI methods required a much greater volume of water than the USDA-15 method but produced results that are more consistent. The most consistent results were obtained by the CSI and DRI methods. The modified USDA method results were similar to the SRI method and were an improvement over the original USDA-15 method. For assessing soil health, additional investigations should be conducted to evaluate a modified version of the USDA procedure using a larger cylinder.",infiltrometer methods; infiltration rate; soil health,2022,77,6,10.2489/jSWC.2022.00178,0022-4561,9,66,293,1794,3,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,Is surfacing a good choice for trail management? Evidence from four high-use hiking trails in Hong Kong,"Trail degradation is a common management problem in protected areas around the world. To prevent intensively used trails from degradation, they can be surfaced with durable materials. However, the surfaced tread may not necessarily provide full protection to the whole trail because the tread is just a part of the surfaced trail. A very limited number of studies have evaluated the performance of surfaced trails by empirically examining their conditions. Therefore, this paper collected data from 189 sample points along four high-use hiking trails in Hong Kong and examined the effects of surfacing, trail gradient, and their interactions on four trail condition indicators. The results indicated that, overall, both surfac-ing and trail gradient significantly affected trail conditions. Specifically, surfacing significantly reduced soil loss and soil compaction. Furthermore, the effects of trail gradient on width, maximum incision, and cross sectional area were significant among unsurfaced trails, but not in surfaced trails. These findings can supplement the existing literature by providing an under-standing of relations between surfacing, trail gradient, and trail condition.",protected area; surfacing; trail condition; trail gradient; trail management,2022,77,6,10.2489/jSWC.2022.00143,0022-4561,17,103,170,1187,5,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes

JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION,Short-term soil physical responses to grazing and cover crops in an integrated crop-livestock agroecosystem,"Cover crops (CCs) and grazing play critical roles in the successful implementa-tion of integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLSs) because they can have a direct impact on soil functions. The present study was conducted to assess the short-term impacts of CCs and grazing on soil physical and hydrological properties. Two sites (Northern-Brookings and Northwestern-Brookings) were established in 2016 and 2017, respectively, in South Dakota, United States. The specific objective was to evaluate the impact of CCs and grazed CCs under oat (Avena sativa L.)/CCs-corn (Zea mays L.) rotation on soil physical and hydrological properties. Study treatments included (1) legume-dominated CC (LdC), (2) cattle-grazed LdC (LdC+G), (3) grass-dominated CC (GdC), (4) cattle-grazed GdC (GdC+G), and (5) no CC and no grazing (NC). After two to three years of management, CCs and grazing did not impact soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks, and their values at approx-imate depth of 0 to 20 cm ranged from 50.9 to 60.6 Mg C ha-1 and 3.65 to 4.92 Mg N ha-1, respectively, among the treatments at each site. Cover crops decreased soil bulk density (rho b) at 0 to 10 cm and 10 to 20 cm depths and, in general, increased soil water retention (SWR), total porosity, and quasi-steady infiltration rate (Northern-Brookings only) compared to the NC. Cattle grazing of CC generally increased rho b and reduced SWR and porosity compared with the ungrazed CC but not to the often-perceived detrimental levels. Our findings showed that CCs can improve some aspects of soil physical health in the short term and that grazing of CCs and crop residue did not cause substantial physical damage to the soil under the condi-tions of these experiments.",cover crops; grazing; integrated crop; livestock system; soil physical\&nbsp; and hydrological properties,2022,77,5,10.2489/jSWC.2022.00095,0022-4561,14,107,278,1739,6,NA,400,6,No,425,375,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY,"A new aetiocetid (Cetacea, Mysticeti, Aetiocetidae) from the late Oligocene of Mexico","The aetiocetids are a well-known extinct taxon of Oligocene toothed mysticetes in the North Pacific. They display a high degree of diversity contrasting with that of other tooth-bearing mysticetes such as mammalodontids, llanocetids and Coronodon spp. The disparate developmental patterns (heterochrony) and origin of the first kelp forests in the North Pacific during the Eocene-Oligocene transition might explain such diversity. Aetiocetidae have been the focus of debate regarding the origin of baleen and filter-feeding in Mysticeti. The current interpretation of aetiocetid feeding strategies is based on the presence of teeth, unfused mandibular symphysis and lateral palatal foramina. However, our understating of their feeding apparatus function is limited, leaving associated structures like the zygomatic arch unnoticed. The present study describes a new fossil of a small-sized mysticete (similar to 3 m long), Kaaucetus thesaurus gen. et sp. nov., which belongs to Aetiocetidae. The protruded squamosal prominence and distinctive zygomatic process present in this new fossil highlight disparity in feeding morphology amongst aetiocetids. Moreover, the zygomatic arch complex and masticatory muscle system reconstruction are crucial to interpreting the likely capability of mastication (shearing motion) in aetiocetids and other toothed mysticetes.

As in other podocnemidid genera, Gestemys exhibits a fully developed and medially extensive cavum pterygoidei, an incisura columellae auris enclosing the stapes and Eustachian tube, and lacks an exoccipital quadrate contact. Gestemys powelli bears a huge foramen palatinum posterius and a short pterygoid flange that does not reach the basisphenoid suture, exposing the cavum pterygoid. Phylogenetic analyses place Gestemys powelli as a member of Podocnemididae more closely related to Erymnochelyinae than Podocnemidinae. In regards to the palaeoenvironmental settings of the Palaeogene formations (Maiz Gordo and Geste) of north-western Argentina, at least two features differentiate the palaeoenvironment where G. powelli was recovered and those of other podocnemidid turtles from the Maiz Gordo Formation: 1) G. powelli was found in situ with very little re-working; and 2) in contrast to the muddy rocks indicating the marginal lacustrine setting and humid climate of the Maiz Gordo Formation, G. powelli is associated with a coarse-grained floodplain setting and a dry, temperate climate.

JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY,A new proterochampsid (Archosauriformes: Proterochampsia) from the Late Triassic of southern Brazil and the emergence of archosaurian hind limb traits,"Characterized by an elongated snout, proterochampsids are carnivorous non-archosaur archosauriforms. The clade is endemic to South America and its fossil record extends from the early Carnian to the late Carnian/early Norian. Nesting close to Archosauria, it is a key clade for understanding the origin and evolution of archosaurian traits. Unfortunately, hind limb elements are usually poorly preserved for the group. Therefore, the hind limb anatomy of proterochampsids still lacks detailed descriptions. In the present study, we partially fill this gap with the description of a new proterochampsid represented by a complete and well-preserved hind limb. Stenoscelida aurantiacus gen. et sp. nov. was excavated from the late Carnian/early Norian (Late Triassic) beds of southern Brazil. A phylogenetic investigation recovers the new taxon as a non-rhadinosuchine proterochampsid. The species bears an unusual set of traits for the group, which provides clues on the evolutionary origins of some muscle attachment structures. For instance, the femur of Stenoscelida aurantiacus gen. et sp. nov. possesses an anterior trochanter and an anterolateral scar. So far, these features have not been reported in other non-archosaurian archosauriforms. Therefore, the new specimen indicates that some typical archosaurian features evolved earlier than previously thought. The taxon also carries additional uncommon features for proterochampsids, such as an iliofibularis tubercle on the anterior margin of the fibula and a vestigial phalanx in digit V.

Given that Kermackodon has been regarded as a transitional form between multituberculates and ``haramiyidans{'' these taxonomical modifications would affect interpretation of early evolution of allotherians. In a comparison of molars in known ``haramiyidans{''}, we delve into their occlusal patterns and cusp homologies that have been controversial but pivotal for understanding evolution of allotherians.

Morphometric and PAUP based phylogenetic analyses place Progonomys prasadi sp. nov. within the Progonomys lineage. The cladogram obtained for the Siwalik murines suggest that Progonomys was ancestral to all the modem and one extinct murine genera recovered from the Siwaliks. The advanced features of Myocricetodon gujaratensis sp. nov. indicate that it was an immigrant to the subcontinent in the late Miocene.

Here, we present a comprehensive redescription of Dashanpusaurus dongi, a species of sauropod found only in the lower Shaximiao Formation. We define the revised autapomorphies of the species as follows: neural canals are sub-square in anterior dorsal vertebrae; the presence of a thin accessory lamina that contacts the prezygodiapophyseal and paradiapophyseal laminae of the middle dorsals, forming an angle of 75 degrees to the horizontal; and four ridges on the anterodistal edge of the humerus. Often considered part of the epipophyseal-prezygapophyseal lamina, a strut invades the spinodiapophyseal fossa in the cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae.

This comparative anatomical data provides an opportunity to revisit the phylogenetic position of Dashanpusaurus and the relationships of the neosauropod clade. Recovered as a macronarian, a better understanding of Dashanpusaurus dongi will allow for clarification of the origin, early evolution, and palaeogeographical distribution of neosauropods.

JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY,"Phylogenetic analysis of the gastropod genus Calliotropis Seguenza, 1902 (Vetigastropoda: Calliotropidae), including fossil and living species","The taxonomic content of the genus Calliotropis and the systematic positions of the fossil species referred to this genus have been under debate because of the striking resemblance they bear to their extant counterparts in terms of general shell morphology and ornament pattern. In a recent contribution, two subgenera of Calliotropis were preliminarily distinguished and considered to be a result of ecomorphological variation translated into evolutionary changes: shallow-reef ecomorphotypes, representing the fossil species of Calliotropis (Riselloidea), and deep-water ecomorphotypes, grouping the living forms of Calliotropis (Calliotropis). However, this division of Calliotropis species was based on qualitative grounds, lacking a quantitative phylogenetic analysis sampling both modern and fossil taxa. The present research aims to comprehensively revisit this systematic scheme after a morphological delimitation of calliotropid lineages. We use a quantitative phylogenetic analysis to shed light on the evolutionary history of this group of gastropods.

The fish was named almost 150 years ago, but has never been well described or figured. Probably because of this, it has not been included in phylogenies of extant pipefishes and seahorses (Syngnathiformes). A detailed description is provided, along with a new phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters that allows the Eocene fish to be confidently placed with the extant families Syngnathidae (pipefishes and seahorses) and Solenostomidae (ghost seahorses) along with the Paleocene marine fossil dagger Eekaulostomus cuevasae from Mexico. The vast majority of these fishes are marine inhabitants, with a few syngnathids entering brackish or freshwater habitats. dagger Protosyngnathus documents the occurrence of syngnathiform fishes in a lacustrine environment, indicating that this lineage invaded and became adapted to the freshwater environment early in the evolution of this group.",Eocene; Indonesia; Gasterosteiformes; Protosyngnathidae; Syngnathifomes,2022,20,1,10.1080/14772019.2022.2113832,1477-2019,19,171,147,1042,5,NA,300,6,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY,"The first evidence of Heosminthus from North America and the phylogenetics of Sminthidae (Mammalia, Rodentia, Dipodoidea): biogeographical implications","The Eurasian fossil record is rich with the remains of sminthid rodents, a Glade today represented by a single genus, Sicista. In contrast, the North American record of the family is sparse and exclusively composed of species of Plesiosminthus, an animal bearing a grooved incisor, during the Oligocene. This fossil record is the product of dispersal events from Eurasia. We here present the first occurrence of a smooth-incisor sminthid from North America. The new species, Heosminthus teredens from the Arikareean-aged Cabbage Patch beds of Montana, represents a rare occurrence of cranial material showing the clear association between incisors and cheek teeth, and the first postcranial remains for fossil sminthids. Our phylogenetic analysis, expanding on prior work, shows that Heosminthus teredens is most closely related to Heosminthus borrae, from Mongolia. In combination with published radioisotopic dating, our phylogenetic framework of sminthids provides evidence for an additional dispersal of sminthid rodents from Eurasia to North America 30 million years ago via Beringia. Our morphometric analysis of the tibia and metatarsal supports a terrestrial ecology for the new species; it is possible the animal had limited scansorial and/or saltatorial abilities.

JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY,A new dagger Pachycormiformes (Actinopterygii) from the Upper Jurassic of Gondwana sheds light on the evolutionary history of the group,"As part of the transition from Holostei to Teleostei, dagger Pachycormiformes represent a key group of fishes. However, the anatomy and phylogenetic relationships of the group in the context of the neopterygians are far from being understood. In this contribution we describe a new pachycormiform, dagger Kaykay lafken gen. et sp. nov., from the Upper Jurassic of Argentina. We made an exhaustive review of morphological characters of holostean and teleostean fishes and explore through a cladistic analysis the phylogenetic relationships of the new species. dagger Kaykay gen. nov. is retrieved among dagger Pachycormiformes as being the sister taxon of the macrocarnivorous Glade composed of dagger Orthocormus and dagger Hypsocormus. Among dagger Pachycormiformes the pattern of relationships mostly agrees with previous hypotheses, although our study highlights the still poor knowledge of the anatomy of this group. According to our results dagger Saurostomus is the sister taxon of other toothed pachycormids. dagger Orthocormus species are recovered as a monophyletic group. The unsolved position of dagger Pachycormus and dagger Sauropsis might be a consequence of poor preservation, revealing a lack of understanding of their anatomy. Our phylogenetic analysis also confirms the rapid radiation of holosteans and teleosteomorphs in the Early Triassic and the radiation of pholidophoriforms in the Middle Triassic. dagger Aspidorhynchoidei radiate in the Early Jurassic.

The majority of the species studied are slow-growing and had a median height of <200 cm at the age of 16 years.

JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,Favourable climatic niche in low elevations outside the flood zone characterises the distribution pattern of venomous snakes in Bangladesh,"Snakes are sensitive to both environmental and climate gradients. To design conservation plans, a scientific understanding of snake habitats in light of environmental and climatic variables is an essential prerequisite. For venomous snakes, denoting favourable habitats should also be relevant for snakebite management. We have considered 18 spatial variables to portray the range of terrestrial venomous snake distribution in Bangladesh. Our results indicate that the distribution of 29 studied venomous snakes in this country is primarily driven by climatic and environmental variables. We found that especially low elevation and flood risk constrain the distribution of those terrestrial snakes, i.e. regular floods in central Bangladesh push venomous snakes towards the edges of the country. Moreover, none of these species occupies the whole of its anticipated climatically favourable area. Projections into the future indicated that 11 studied species, Amphiesma platyceps, Boiga siamensis, Chrysopelea ornata, Pseudoxenodon macrops, Rhabdophis himalayanus, Rhabdophis subminiatus, Bungarus lividus, Ophiophagus hannah, Daboia russelii, Ovophis monticola and Trimeresurus popeiorum will lose their entire climatically suitable area within the country. Therefore, we suggest establishing more protected areas in the hilly ecosystems in the eastern part and in the mangrove forests in the south-western corner of Bangladesh to mitigate future extinction risks, such as climate change, sea-level rise and increase in flood severity. Conserving village forests and croplands, which are subject to rapid change, will also need to be addressed equally, as these are inhabited by almost one-third of the studied species.

JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Habitat use by mixed-species bird flocks in tropical forests of the Western Ghats, India","While mixed-species flocks of birds (hereafter `flocks') have been widely studied, few studies have looked at the effect of habitat structure on flock presence and flocking propensity within a site. Here, we employ a use-availability approach in locations with flocks and random locations to ask whether habitat characteristics influence the presence of flocks, and whether structurally similar microhabitats support compositionally similar flocks. We also examine the effect of habitat on flock size and species richness, and the effect of intraspecifically gregarious flock participants on habitat selection. We find that flocks use a narrow subset of available tree density and canopy cover variation and prefer relatively less-dense areas with large trees and a complex foliage structure. Similar microhabitats do not result in compositionally similar flocks, and while foliage complexity was associated with flock size, no habitat characteristics influenced species richness. Flocks led by the intraspecifically gregarious western crowned warbler (Phylloscopus occipitalis), a potential nuclear species, showed preference for high foliage complexity and tree density. Thus, habitat preferences of intraspecifically gregarious species, which are followed by other species, could play a strong role in habitat selection in flocks. This suggests that degraded forests that cannot provide a suitable range of tree density, canopy cover, and/or complex vegetation structure may not support some core flock species around which flocks form, which may lead to decreased flocking in those patches.",flock composition; foraging; habitat structure; habitat use; microhabitat; mixed-species flocks; Western Ghats,2022,NA,NA,10.1017/S026646742200030X,0266-4674,14,88,226,1594,7,26,200,10,No,225,175,yes,no,yes

JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,Interaction networks between solitary hymenopterans and their natural enemies in different restoration areas,"The diversity of species and their interactions have been positively related with environmental complexity. Therefore, highly anthropized environments have their integrity under serious threat. These effects may last for years compromising the dynamics of natural communities, such as antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, including host-natural enemy interactions. To investigate these effects, trap nest methodology was used to assess the diversity of solitary bees, wasps and their natural enemies in three fragmented environments with different degree of anthropic perturbation, composed of a Eucalyptus plantation (considered here as higher perturbation), a Cerrado area (medium perturbation) and a Riparian forest (lesser perturbation). Then, host-natural enemies associations were analysed to verify the size, specialization degree and modularity of interaction network. The gradient from highest to lowest degree of anthropic perturbation was evidenced in the species diversity index, the size of the interaction network and the specialization indexes of the host-natural enemy network. The environment with Eucalyptus plantation showed higher values of diversity of natural enemies, greater number of species in the interaction network, lesser degree of specialization in the interaction and lesser modularity, than Cerrado and Riparian forest environments, respectively. The low degree of nestedness and lack of significance of this index to all sampled areas are indicative of a specialized pattern of networks.

JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,Tree height effects on vascular anatomy of upper-canopy twigs across a wide range of tropical rainforest species,"Vessel diameter variation along the hydraulic pathway determines how much water can be moved against the force of gravity from roots to leaves. While it is well-documented that tree size scales with vessel diameter variation at the stem base due to the effect of basipetal vessel widening, much less is known whether this likewise applies to terminal sun-exposed twigs. To analyze the effect of tree height on twig xylem anatomy, we compiled data for 279 tropical rainforest tree species belonging to 56 families in the lowlands of Jambi Province, Indonesia. Terminal upper-canopy twigs of fully grown individuals were collected and used for wood anatomical analysis. We show that hydraulically weighted vessel diameter (D (h)) and potential hydraulic conductivity (K (p)) of upper canopy twigs increase with tree height across species although the relationship was weak. When averaged across given tree height classes irrespectively of species identity, however, a strong dependency of tree height on D (h) and K (p) was observed, but not on the lumen-to-sapwood area ratio (A (l):A (x)) or vessel density (VD). According to the comparison between actual tree height and the maximum tree height reported for a given species in the stand, we show that the vascular xylem anatomy of their terminal twigs reflects their canopy position and thus ecological niche (understory versus overstory) at maturity.

Results suggest that individuals which successfully reached the Maldives, on their way from India to Africa, had a broader wing base and an overall more slender wing shape than individuals in southern India.

JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,Arid community responses to nitrogen and carbon addition depend on dominant species traits and are decoupled between above- and below-ground biomass,"Questions Arid communities are strongly limited by soil resources including water and nitrogen (N). Plants compete for N with other plants and microorganisms, which are also limited by carbon (C). We propose that above- and below-ground plant responses to soil resources are modulated by community structure (species relative abundances, ``mass ratio hypothesis{''}) and species traits (relative growth rates - RGRs). We evaluated the single and combined effects of soil N and C addition on the above- and below-ground biomass accumulation of perennial grass patches in an arid community, and the mechanisms involved in their responses. Location Patagonian steppe, Argentina. Methods We added N (2 g N m(-2); NH4NO3) and C (330 g C m(-2); sucrose) to 1-m(2) field plots in a factorial design. After two years, we harvested above-ground (n = 5 plots) and below-ground biomass (n = 10 soil cores) and sorted it by species. We measured potential soil respiration as a proxy of microbial activity. Results Total above-ground biomass increased by 55\% as a result of N and decreased by 45\% as a result of C addition, in relation to controls. C addition reduced total below-ground biomass by 42\%. The above-ground differences were associated with changes in the biomass of dominant species according to their RGRs. Poa ligularis (dominant, high RGR) increased by 92\% as a result of N addition while Pappostipa speciosa (dominant, low RGR) decreased by 55\% as a result of C addition. Intermediate and subordinate grasses did not modify their biomass, independently of their RGR. Potential soil respiration was three times higher in plots with C addition than in control plots. Conclusions Community biomass was explained by a combination of mass ratio hypothesis and specific RGR, as dominant grasses controlled above-ground community responses to N (high-RGR species) and C addition (low-RGR species).

We examined the spatiotemporal distribution of pollen traits related to dispersal (ornamentation and dispersal unit) and desiccation tolerance (wall thickness, presence of furrows and pores and pollen size). Specifically, we address two questions: how are the pollen traits distributed in relation to different levels of aridity? And, how did the pollen trait composition change with changing past environmental conditions? Location Laurel forests of La Gomera and Tenerife (Canary Islands). Methods We used pollen rain from 19 forest plots on an elevational gradient of 1050 m and all laurel forest types (cold, dry, humid and ridge crest) to quantify pollen trait composition using community-weighted means. In addition, we used fossil pollen to examine the composition of pollen traits over 9600 years in response to known intervals of regional past climate change. Results Our results demonstrated increased prevalence of desiccation tolerance-related pollen traits over drier areas of the laurel forest distribution. We also found increased prevalence of rich pollen grain ornamentation in the core of the laurel forest distribution.

Methods We characterized community traits and their relationships to climate and soil, using a data set with 1312 plots of tree communities composed of 1591 tree species and 10 functional traits across China. Using quadratic models, we explored how community traits change with different environmental factors. Results Trait spectra at the species level and the community level were significantly correlated, and the first two principal components captured 74.5\% of the variation in community-weighted mean traits. The trait spectra showed a clear elevational pattern and varied along climate and soil gradients. Compared with random expectations, the multi-trait functional diversity showed a divergence pattern on poor soils at the plot scale. Conclusions Two well-known dimensions, the leaf economics spectrum and size-related spectrum, could be extended from the species level to the community level. Environment, especially climate conditions, drives the trait spectra and their elevational patterns at the broad scale, indicating environmental filtering might shape the trait composition of tree communities in China.

JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,Incipient woody plant encroachment signals heightened vulnerability for an intact grassland region,"Question What constrains Juniperus virginiana encroachment in semi-arid grasslands: precipitation-based constraints on establishment or dispersal-based constraints on spread? Location Sandhills grassland, Nebraska, USA. Methods We tracked juvenile and adult stages of J. virginiana encroachment using field sampling and remote sensing across a network of 40 sites spanning a wide precipitation gradient (399-655 mm). Regional patterns of encroachment were then used to assess the relative support for precipitation-based constraints on establishment versus dispersal-based constraints on spread in a region transitioning to a more encroached state. Results Woody encroachment was widespread and we found no evidence that low precipitation precludes encroachment in the Sandhills. Instead, encroachment patterns were best described by proximity to planted propagule sources. However, levels of encroachment were highly variable. Encroachment density was low at more arid sites that lacked nearby stands of planted J. virginiana, and encroachment tended to increase with proximity to plantings and higher mean annual precipitation, suggesting that both variables play a role in the rate of encroachment. Conclusion Our results indicate that woody encroachment is constrained by dispersal in the Sandhills and that planted propagule sources increase grassland vulnerability to encroachment, regardless of mean annual precipitation. This may be true for other intact grassland regions where barriers to woody plant establishment have been altered or overcome. A key implication is that programs and policies need to consider encroachment risks from planted propagule sources and how to manage them to avoid fragmentation of intact grasslands.",Afforestation; dispersal-limited encroachment; Juniperus virginiana L; mean annual precipitation threshold; propagule pressure; Sandhills; shifting baseline; tree invasion; vulnerability; woody plant encroachment,2022,33,6,10.1111/jvs.13155,1100-9233,12,98,240,1738,10,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,Species traits interact with stress level to determine intraspecific facilitation and competition,"Questions Flooding and drought stress are expected to increase significantly across the world and plant responses to these abiotic changes may be mediated by plant-plant interactions. Stress tolerance and recovery often require a biomass investment that may have consequences for these plant-plant interactions. Therefore, we questioned whether phenotypic plasticity in response to flooding and drought affected the balance between competition and facilitation for species with specific adaptations to drought or flooding. Location Utrecht University. Methods Stem elongation, root porosity, root:shoot ratio and biomass production were measured for six species during drought, well-drained and submerged conditions when grown alone or together with conspecifics. We quantified competition and facilitation as the `neighbour intensity effect' directly after the 10-day treatment and again after a seven-day recovery period in well-drained conditions. Results Water stress, planting density and species identity interactively affected standardized stem elongation in a way that could lead to facilitation during submergence for species that preferably grow in wet soils. Root porosity was affected by the interaction between neighbour presence and time-step. Plant traits were only slightly affected during drought. The calculated neighbour interaction effect indicated facilitation for wetland species during submerged conditions and, after a period to recover from flooding, for species that prefer dry habitats. Conclusions Our results imply that changing plant-plant interactions in response to submergence and to a lesser extent to drought should be considered when predicting vegetation dynamics due to changing hydroclimatic regimes.

JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,Vertical and horizontal light heterogeneity along gradients of secondary succession in cool- and warm-temperate forests,"Aims Light availability varies drastically in forests, both vertically and horizontally. Vertical light heterogeneity (i.e., patterns of light attenuation from the forest canopy to the floor) may be related to light competition among trees, while horizontal light heterogeneity (i.e., variations in light intensity at a given height within forests) may be associated with light-niche partitioning among tree species. However, light heterogeneity in vertical and horizontal directions and their associations with forest structure are rarely studied to date. Here we report the first comprehensive study to compare the vertical and horizontal light heterogeneity in differently aged forests in two forest types. Location Twelve forest stands of different ages in cool-temperate forests (consisting of deciduous broad-leaved trees) and five of different ages in warm-temperate forests (evergreen conifer and deciduous broad-leaved trees) in Japan. Methods We measured vertical light profiles at 1-m intervals from the understorey (1 m above the ground) to the top canopy (12-22 m depending on stands) at 16 locations for each stand (20 m x 20 m). We also measured structural parameters (diameter at breast height, height, and crown dimensions) for all major trees in these stands. Results Along the secondary successional gradients, the vertical and horizontal light heterogeneity changed in a systematic manner in both forests. The vertical light attenuation rate was steeper in early succession and more gradual in late succession, and the horizontal light heterogeneity was relatively small in early succession and more pronounced in late succession. The vertical light attenuation rate was different between the two forest types; the light intensity dropped more sharply from the canopy surface in the cool-temperate forests due to the crown being vertically shorter and denser (i.e., higher leaf density per unit volume). Conclusion In early succession, a steeper light attenuation rate is likely related to the strong light competition among co-occurring trees and thus a self-thinning process. In late succession, the high spatial light heterogeneity in forests (i.e., larger horizontal light heterogeneity and gradual light attenuation rate) may allow more species to partition light, and thus may enhance species coexistence and diversity.",forest structure; horizontal light heterogeneity; light attenuation rate; light competition; secondary succession; species coexistence; temperate forests; understorey light intensity; vertical light profile,2022,33,3,10.1111/jvs.13135,1100-9233,15,119,343,2345,9,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,Ecotones in Central European forest-steppe: Edge effect occurs on hard rocks but not on loess,"Aims We asked how geological substrate affects the distribution of plant species between forest interiors, forest edges, and steppe patches in the forest-steppe landscapes. Specifically, we sought for the presence of the edge effect at the forest-grassland transitions on different substrates. Location Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and western Ukraine. Methods We recorded the occurrence of vascular plant species in forest interiors, at forest edges and in steppe patches on 40 forest-steppe sites located on four substrates (andesite, dolomite, limestone and loess). We compared the distribution of species diversity, beta diversity (using multivariate analysis), the number of shared species between habitats and the estimation of vegetation biomass among forest-steppe habitats on different substrates. Results The edge effect was observed on hard rocks, while it was absent on loess, where the ecotone species richness was intermediate between that of forest and steppe. Loess sites also had the lowest species turnover between forest and steppe and the lowest number of edge specialists. Conclusions Substrate has a strong effect on the formation of forest-steppe mosaics. It shapes the assembly rules and plant community diversity within individual habitat mosaics. Plant communities on each substrate can respond differently to changing climate. The strong assembly rules on hard rocks may be more likely to result in species loss than on loess or similar soft sediments, where a larger number of species find their optimum in more than one forest-steppe habitat.",ecotone; edge-effect; forest-steppe; habitat mosaic; substrate; vegetation,2022,33,5,10.1111/jvs.13149,1100-9233,15,93,234,1585,6,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,Which regionalization scheme is the best to predict wetland plant distribution in Western Patagonia?,"QuestionsGiven the current multiplicity of threats to pond biodiversity, there is a clear need to examine which environmental drivers determine the composition and distribution of species. Using wetland plants as pond biodiversity surrogates, two questions led to this work: How do wetland plant species assemblages and abundance vary across local- and regional-scale classification schemes in wetlands? How does wetland plant beta-diversity vary within these wetland classification schemes? LocationWestern Patagonia, Argentina, from 36 degrees S to 56 degrees S and from 73 degrees W to 65 degrees W. MethodsWetland plant distribution constrained by water and climatic factors was analyzed using canonical correspondence analysis. Variance partitioning analysis was performed to assess which classification scheme (phytogeographical units, wetland regions, wetland genesis and hydrogeomorphological types) better explained variation in plant composition. An IndVal analysis was also carried out to detect taxa with the highest association values (indicator taxa) for the different categories of wetland classification. Beta-diversity was calculated to evaluate variation patterns within classification schemes. ResultsPlant distribution was mainly related to site location across the latitudinal gradient, following a decreasing pattern of air temperature from northern to southern wetlands. Variance partitioning analysis confirmed the effectiveness of a regional-scale classification (wetland regions) in predicting plant associations, and the IndVal analysis also highlighted this classification scheme above the remainder, sustaining the highest number of indicator taxa. Wetland plant beta-diversity patterns were explained by relatively high species turnover, with species composition showing low nestedness values. ConclusionClimate factors rather than local characteristics were the main drivers of plant distribution at the wide regional scale analyzed. Wetland region (classification based on climatic criteria) was the most effective scheme in predicting plant associations and sustaining the highest number of indicator taxa. Also, ponds located in the Patagonian Andes and those with a glacigenic origin contribute most to the regional wetland plant diversity. Therefore, these aspects should be taken directly into account in the future delineation of protected areas to increase the resilience of Patagonian wetland habitats and their associated biota, and to maintain the ecosystem services that they provide.",beta-diversity; climate; genesis; hydrogeomorphological types; Patagonian wetlands; phytogeographical units; water quality; wetland plants; wetland regions,2022,33,6,10.1111/jvs.13157,1100-9233,14,100,339,2527,9,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,yes,no,yes
JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Dynamics of a mountain grassland: Environment predicts long-term trends, while species' traits predict short-term fluctuations","Aims Dynamics of plant communities are an outcome of species' responses to the external environment influenced by species' life history, growth patterns and their mutual interactions. We aimed to disentangle the long-term directional trends, likely associated with decadal change in environmental conditions, from short-term species fluctuations. Location Krkonose Mountains, North Bohemia, Czech Republic. Method To disentangle these processes, we used data from four plots in a temperate mountain grassland recorded yearly from 1985 to 2019. Results We identified distinct types of temporal dynamics of individual species (using Fourier analysis) as well as directional shifts in abundance of individual species. Species fluctuations were best predicted by species' traits (namely taller species and those with a larger bud bank being less likely to fluctuate), likely due to demographic processes specific for individual species within the community. In contrast, directional trends were better predicted by species' environmental preferences expressed by Ellenberg indicator values. We found consistent shifts in vegetation composition towards that with higher Ellenberg indicator values for soil reaction and light and lower indicator value for moisture, which can be explained both by the global change and local factors. Conclusion Our results thus show that short-term dynamics of individual species is determined by their traits, while long-term trends of a grassland community are determined by the environmental change.",Ellenberg-type indicator values; global environmental change; plant species and community dynamics; plant traits; spectral analysis,2022,33,3,10.1111/jvs.13138,1100-9233,15,126,216,1530,5,NA,300,10,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY,On the Road Again: Touring iNaturalist for roadkill observations as a new tool for ecologists,"As human populations continue to increase and utilize highways, the potential negative impact of roadways on wildlife mortality (roadkill), is expected to increase accordingly. Documenting vertebrates killed on roadways can be time consumptive for local wildlife managers researching population trends of predominantly mammals and reptiles encountered. New citizen science observations taken on cell phones using the application iNaturalist provide a potentially powerful new tool to inform roadkill occurrence and its impact across taxonomic groups and geographic areas. To this end, I downloaded and surveyed data observations on iNaturalist for ???road kill??? and ???dead on road??? or ???DOR???, within the United States, resulting in 17,926 total observations following database quality control, spanning 1973 to February of 2022. Overall of the 710 distinct species identified as roadkill, reptiles were the most frequently reported (12,127 observations), with eight of the top ten reported observations of roadkill being snakes. Mammals represented 3,094 observations followed by birds and amphibians, with 1,363 and 1,342 observations, respectively. Interestingly, I noted some differences for a season of roadkill observations with summer having the highest reports of roadkill for both reptiles and amphibians, with more reports of mammals as roadkill in fall. This study contributes to our body of knowledge on roadkill ecology and can provide wildlife diversity biologists with a new avenue using citizen science data as this smartphone application becomes increasingly utilized for research on biodiversity.",roadkill; vertebrate biology; scavenging ecology; iNaturalist; biodiversity; road mortality; conservation; citizen science; road ecology,2022,6,3,10.22120/jwb.2022.300322.1479,NA,15,93,229,1621,9,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY,Investigating the relationship between haplotype diversity of Asia minor spiny mouse (Acomys cilicicus) and environmental factors,"Asia Minor Spiny Mouse (Acomys Cilicicus) is one of the endemic spiny mouse species of Turkey. The species is vulnerable to environmental threats as conservation measures have not yet been determined. Understanding the genetic makeup of the species and its responses to ecological factors is, therefore, an important issue to develop applicable conservation measures. In the study, we aimed to identify the Acomys cilicicus' haplotype diversity for Cytochrome b (CYTB), Growth hormone receptor (GHR), and Recombination activating gene 2 (RAG2) genes and to explore spatial relationships between environmental factors and haplotype diversity of each gene. The spatial distribution pattern of haplotype diversity of genes was estimated using the Geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation, respectively. Moreover, the Monte Carlo permutation test was applied to reveal the relationship pattern between environmental predictors and haplotype diversity through local coefficient estimates. As a result, a logistic prediction map of the GWR model was obtained to indicate the distribution of haplotype diversity of genes. Outputs also showed considerable spatial variability in local coefficients estimates with the negative or positive association, and it was understood that the distribution pattern of haplotype diversity is delineated accordingly. In that context, it was concluded that local fluctuations of environmental conditions might negatively affect the haplotype diversity of genes, thus decreasing the species' adaptability to environmental changes. Outputs of the study are valuable to support the conservation efforts of the target species and can be a guide for species with similar characteristics.",Acomys cilicicus; environmental factors; haplotype diversity; geographically weighted regression; species conservation,2022,6,3,10.5281/zenodo.6569494,NA,16,129,248,1765,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY,"Nutrition of the Edible dormouse (Glis glis Linnaeus, 1766) across the distributional range","The edible dormouse is an example of adaptations of mammal nutrition for a long hibernation. Because of the absence of caecum, the food of dormice is rather refined. The animals prefer foods with a significant content of nutrients. The main food is tree seeds, such as beech nuts and acorns. Also, hazelnuts, walnuts, chestnuts, cones, and birch seeds may become the main forages in several localities. All available fruits in biotopes make a significant part of the species' diet. Green parts of plants and animal food are permanent additions. Strong seasonal changes depend on the availability of forages in biotopes present. At the beginning of the active season in May-June tree buds, flowers, leaves, young bark, last-year tree seeds, and invertebrates are the main forages. In July-August, mainly fruits, berries, and unripe tree seeds become the basis of the diet. Before hibernation, high-calorie tree seeds are the most important. Geographical differences determine the species' diet depending on the composition of plant communities in biotopes. Predation of birds is also registered in several regions.

JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY,Impact of forest wildfires on components of mountain landscapes of the Baikal region,"Forest wildfires cover vast territories of mountainous Siberia. As a result, the appearance of the landscape changes completely, as well as the properties of its components. The paper considers the impact of wildfires on the components of the mountain-taiga geosystems of the Primorskii Range, which stretches along the western shore of Lake Baikal. This is the driest area in the Baikal region, with Goletz and mountain-taiga landscapes, coupled with steppe areas. Wildfires regularly occur during hot and dry periods in all zones of the range, especially since 2015. We made landscape descriptions of the territory of the key site and compiled a map of the landscape structure with conflagration fires overlapped with partially and, optionally, completely burnt-out areas. The vegetation cover has suffered the most, and the characteristics of the hydrological regime and the properties of soils have changed. The vegetation is at the initial stage of recovery, and only a few species can be found in the herbaceous-subshrub cover. The characteristics of the water regime, primarily the temperature on the pyrogenically disturbed catchments, undergo significant changes. The mode of mineralization of streams is unstable, and the amplitudes of water level fluctuations are higher due to the destruction of the natural underlying surface of the catchment. The chemical composition of water in streams after wildfires is generally preserved. Although, an increase in the concentration of nitrates and hydrocarbons is possibly due to fires. Pyrogenic destruction of forest ecosystems inevitably leads to the degradation of mountain soils, which are restored over many decades. After fires in soils, acidity and, consequently, the content of organic matter decreases due to their mineralization.",Baikal region; mountain-taiga landscapes; mapping; wildfires,2022,6,2,10.5281/zenodo.6570597,NA,13,84,269,1793,4,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

We carried out a reconnaissance recce survey at a sampling intensity of 85\% of 1??1 sq km per grid cell. Accordingly, field operations included accessing the data collection zone within the Southeast section from the East to the South and then to the North. Reconnaissance recce walks were done within a 1km??1km grid cell. Compass, secateurs, GPSs, and Cyber trackers were used to orientate field operations. All nests irrespective of the distance from the reconnaissance recce walks, feeding signs, tree nest-group count, tree height, and water points were recorded in the cyber tracker. GPS ID and waypoints collected irrespective of the distance within the recce survey cell were recorded. For 28 surveyed grid cells, four nest sites of mixed ages containing 34 recent and eight old nests were recorded. Chimpanzee presence/signs were only recorded in the montane forest (encounter rate of 1.2/Km), and in areas of close (visibility of 5 ??? 10m) to open (visibility of 10 ??? 15m) canopies, with no sign observed in areas of highly open canopies (visibility of >15m). Also, these areas fall within an altitude of 1235 to 1325 m asl. with the presence of available water especially from waterfalls. The presence of available food for chimpanzees was also recorded in this area, and all the nests observed were tree nests.

JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY,Morphological and morphometric variations of the water frogs (genus Pelophylax) in Iran,"Despite the efforts conducted on the identification of species of the genus Pelophylax from Iran, recent studies revealed that the taxonomy and identification of local populations within this genus have been still unresolved. Here, the morphological and morphometric variations of water frog populations (Pelophylax) from different localities of Iran were studied. To assess suitable morphological and morphometric diagnosis for taxonomic identification of the genus, 13 morphological and 23 morphometric characters of 160 specimens were analyzed. Our result indicated P. cf. bedriagae and Pelophylax sp. show cryptic variation in morphology and melanistic diversity. In water frogs, this character is much more influenced by compatibility to special habitat, so its value is less to be considered as a taxonomic trait or key character for identification. However, the morphometric variables of Pelophylax sp. are larger than P. cf. bedriagae from the west of Iran. Following generalized Gloger's rule, a comparison of character states of 12 biological variables revealed that dorsal coloration of water frog populations become paler from north to south in eastern Iran, while the ventral part shows low variation in color. This pattern indicates the low selective value of ventral coloration in the viability of water frogs in eastern Iran. Moreover, natural selection stabilized olive coloration on the populations of water frogs living in the green habitats of north Iran while compromising light grey and dark brown in contrasting ecosystems through the semi-desert and humid oases of south Iran via a disruptive selection mechanism.",Pelophylax; Morphological characters; Polymorphism; Iran,2022,6,3,10.5281/zenodo.6826803,NA,12,87,243,1637,4,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Socio-demographic factors mainly gender, age, education level, and distance of household from the park boundary influence (at alpha=0.05 and 0.001) local community perceptions and attitudes towards wildlife conservation. Local community perceptions of the park and wildlife were influenced (at alpha=0.05 and 0.001) by community knowledge and awareness of the existence and importance of the park, its attributes, wildlife resources, and benefits. Local community attitudes were influenced (at alpha=0.05 and 0.001) by the level of conservation education and awareness, resource access and use, handling of victims of illegal entry into the parks, and the costs incurred from invasion by wild animals. We conclude that socio-demographic factors, community knowledge and awareness of the existence of the park, its attributes and resources, community benefits, and costs incurred by the community as a result of invasion by wild animals and vermin, influence community perceptions and attitudes towards conservation of parks and wildlife.

This study investigated the relationship of D. racemosa presence (abundance) and occurrence with static (soil properties and elevation from sea level) and dynamic (climate, precipitation, and human disturbance) variables. Plant and soil samples from 21 locations of occurrence (sites) of D. racemosa were collected along the Caspian Sea's southern coastline. At each site of occurrence (site), three 100 m(2) (10x 10 m) plot was set up, and plant biometry and density were recorded. Soil samples were taken from depths of 0-25 cm and left to air dry in the lab. Later, dried soil samples were crust left to pass through a 2 mm mesh sieve and analyzed for different physicochemical properties. Meteorological data over the past 10 years (2009-2019) in the relevant area were obtained from Iran Meteorological Organization. Cluster analysis classified 21 sampling sites into four groups of habitats. Data were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methods and habitats are classified based on environmental factors. Correlation analysis between environmental factors and density showed that soil texture (clay content), precipitation, and human activity are the most important factors affecting the abundance of D.racemosa.

Sequence analysis of two gene regions was conducted after PCR analysis. An aligned data set was used for creating phylogenetic trees. The results demonstrated that the previously identified S. squatina specimen was revealed as S. aculeata after molecular analysis. Two other specimens which were morphologically identified as S. squatina demonstrated the same results both with molecular and morphological analysis.

This group of nematodes is characterized by a quite homogeneous morphology and cosmopolitan distribution and is prevalent in cultivated and natural soil ecosystems. The present study describes the first interactive and illustrated web-assisted polytomous identification key for the genus Paratylenchus. The updated Paratylenchus species polytomous key was based on a wide list of 24 diagnostic characters generated for the 140 species comprising this genus. Here we developed a web-assisted method to achieve an easy and accurate Paratylenchus species characterization that will greatly improve the identification of these plant-parasitic nematodes for many diagnostic laboratories and researchers. However, this identification needs to be completed with the use of molecular markers available for the species due to the existence of species complexes studied in former researches. This idea is pointed in the polytomous key in the specific species complexes up-to-know. In some cases, the presence in the soil as survival stage of few individuals in the fourth-stage juvenile (J4) required the use of molecular markers for species identification. We suggest the use of at least a fragment of mitochondrial COI gene for species identification or the combination of nuclear D2-D3 regions of the 28S rRNA and the COI to complement each marker. However, for some species complexes, the use of the D2-D3 regions alone has not enough resolution to separate the putative species inside the species complex. Web-based polytomous key was constructed using the free software Xper3, for computers and mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, and pocket PCS).",NA,2022,2022,NA,10.1155/2022/6216266,0947-5745,28,208,253,1708,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,"Avian Diversity and Abundance of Taunsa Barrage Ramsar Site in Punjab, Pakistan","The study of avian species diversity and abundance at the Taunsa Barrage Ramsar site was carried out from September 2019 to March 2020. Taunsa Barrage is an important wetland for international and local migratory birds, including waterfowls, waders, and long-distance migrant avifauna. Data were collected by direct counts made on four-point transects representing a disturbance gradient due to humans and different habitats. Species diversity indices, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and other statistical methods were used to analyze data. A total of 150 avian species of 19 orders and 53 families were recorded. These included 66 migrant species and 84 resident species. The spotting of ten globally threatened species also highlights the importance of wetland for avian species. On average, 1511 +/- 373 (mean +/- SD) species of birds were recorded every month. Shannon's diversity index indicated that Transect Point 2 had higher species diversity (H'=3.779), followed by Transect Points 3, 4, and 1 (H'=3.769, H'=3.491, and H'=3.457, respectively). Evenness index showed that birds evenly distributed in September (E=0.5584) than November (E=0.3109). ANOVA showed a significant difference (F=4.800, df=3, P=0.002) of avian diversity and abundance among the transect points. But there was no statistically significant interaction between months (F=1.23, df=6, P=0.233). The results showed that the Taunsa Barrage Ramsar site harbors plenty of resident migratory and threatened bird species. Hence, it is important to protect its habitat and need to protect avian diversity by overcoming major threats.",NA,2022,2022,NA,10.1155/2022/4736195,0947-5745,12,79,236,1604,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Recent surveys in the northern Arabian Gulf suggest the presence of numerous unidentified species, some of which form shallow reef ecosystems while others are cryptic and found under rocks. In this study, we focused on small oysters from Kuwait, which show typical characteristics in common with the genus Ostrea except for the presence of lophine chomata that would link it to the genera Lopha, Dendostrea, and Alectryonella. Phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial and nuclear markers unambiguously placed the Kuwait oyster within the Ostreinae as a sister to the Japanese species Ostrea futamiensis. The hypothesis that the Kuwait oyster represents a new species was assessed with phylogenetic and species delimitation methods combined with a morphological assessment. Results corroborated the Kuwait oysters as a new species herein described as Ostrea oleomargarita Oliver, Salvi, and Al-Kandari, sp. nov. The phylogeny of the Ostreinae shows extensive disagreement between morphology-based genera and phylogenetic clades. The genus Ostrea is polyphyletic, and the form and distribution of taxonomic characters such as chomata are not as definitive as suggested in previous studies. This study, along with other recent investigations, confirmed the Arabian Gulf as a key region for discovering marine animal diversity and suggested a possible biogeographic divide between the Eastern and Western Indo-Pacific.

JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,DNA Barcoding and Phylogeny of Acari Species Based on ITS and COI Markers,"Acari harbor numerous minute species of agricultural economic importance, mainly Tetranychidae and Phytoseiidae. Great efforts have been established by means of recovering morphological, molecular, and phylogenetic traits for species identification. Traditional identification still relies on external diagnostic characters, which are limited and usually exhibit large phenotypic plasticity within the species, rendering them useless for species delimitation and identification. We decided to increase the number of sequences of the Acari mitochondrial COI (Cytochrome C oxidase I) marker and ITS nuclear ribosomal DNA region for species identification in Tetranychidae and Phytoseiidae. The molecular data allow us to establish species boundaries and phylogenetic relationships among several clades of Acari, mainly Tetranychidae and Phytoseiidae. Sequence comparisons between complete COI and the Acari mitochondrial COI, ITS1-5,8S-ITS2, and ITS2 among all Acari sequences have demonstrated that the selected regions, even small, gave enough informative positions for both species' identification and phylogenetic studies. Analyses of both DNA regions have unveiled their use as species identification characters, with special emphasis on Acari mitochondrial COI for Tetranychidae and Phytoseiidae species in comparison with the Folmer fragment, which has been universally used as a barcode marker. We demonstrated that the Acari mitochondrial COI region is also a suitable marker to establish a barcode dataset for Acari identification. Our phylogenetic analyses are congruent with other recent works, showing that Acari is a monophyletic group, of which Astigmata, Ixodida, Mesostigmata, Oribatida, and Prostigmata are also monophyletic.",NA,2022,2022,NA,10.1155/2022/5317995,0947-5745,13,73,234,1741,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

In this work, we aimed to explore the effect of geographic barriers on the distribution of the phenotypic and genetic variation of a spider species that is widespread in continental and insular America. We obtained an alignment of the mitochondrial locus Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) for 408 individuals across the geographic range of Gasteracantha cancriformis. We used phylogenetics, population genetics, and morphology to explore the genetic and phenotypic variation of this species. We found five genetically differentiated and geographically structured populations. Three of them are distributed in continental America, separated by the Andes mountains, and two are in the Caribbean and Galapagos Islands. Some of these geographic clades shared haplotypes between them, which may be a consequence of dispersal. We detected at least 20 phenotypes of G. cancriformis, some of which were exclusive to a geographic region, while others occurred in multiple regions. We did not observe well-defined morphological differences across male genitalia. This evidence suggests that G. cancriformis is a widespread species with high phenotypic variation that should be explored in more depth.",NA,2022,2022,NA,10.1155/2022/8112945,0947-5745,13,120,189,1306,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Somite formation begins in the body part close to the skull and ends in the tail. The time of separation of somites from the proximal mesoderm depends on the temperature of the air and the substrate. Myoblast cells reach their targets and are connected, and the membranes in the area of their contact are destroyed. Myoblast's fusion creates myosymplasts. The intermediate stage is observed after the formation of small myosymplasts. After that, the chain shape of myosymplasts are transformed into an intermediate plaque form. At this intermediate stage, the number of a nucleus is small, the shape of the nucleus differs from each other, and the location of the nucleus varies. Afterward, the connection of the intermediate forms with each other and with myoblasts forms a rounded shape, where the initial development of myotubules takes place. A fully formed myotubular and myosatellite cells are surrounded by a basal membrane and shape a muscle fiber. The skeletal muscles of the adult Caspian thin-toed gecko are mainly composed of white fibers. Thus, it allows the gecko to move very fast in a short time.

JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,"Landscape Genetics and Species Delimitation in the Andean Palm Rocket Frog (Aromobatidae, Rheobates)","The complex topography of the species-rich northern Andes creates heterogeneous environmental landscapes that are hypothesized to have promoted population fragmentation and diversification by processes such as vicariance or local adaptation. Previous phylogenetic work on the palm rocket frog (Anura: Aromobatidae: Rheobates spp.), endemic to midelevation forests of Colombia, suggested that valleys were important in promoting divergence between lineages. In this study, we first evaluated previous hypotheses of species-level diversity, then fitted an isolation-with-migration (IM) historical demographic model, and tested two landscape genetic models to explain genetic divergence within Rheobates: isolation by distance and isolation by environment. The data consisted of two mitochondrial and four nuclear genes from 24 samples covering most of the geographic range of the genus. Species delimitation by Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography recovered five highly divergent genetic lineages within Rheobates, among which few to no migrants are exchanged according to IM. We found that isolation by environment provided the only variable significantly correlated with genetic distances for both mitochondrial and nuclear genes, suggesting that local adaptation may have a role in driving the genetic divergence within this frog genus. Thus, genetic divergence in Rheobates may be driven more by variation among the local environments where these frogs live rather than by geographic distance.",NA,2022,2022,NA,10.1155/2022/6774225,0947-5745,13,100,206,1500,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,Reproductive Variability in Hippolytid Shrimp Shape Morphotypes,"Shape morph-specific studies in hippolytid shrimps revealed significant results on their ecomorphology and evolutionary adaptations. Among the species of the genus Hippolyte, only one exhibits an unusual, sharp rostral dimorphism and has been used as an animal model for the investigation of mechanisms of the morph-specific adaptation: the intertidal Hippolyte sapphica. The species is endemic of the Central/Eastern Mediterranean basin and exhibits morph-A with a long dentate rostrum and morph-B with a short, juvenile-like one. The two morphotypes were recently confirmed to be conspecific, while offspring and morphological studies showed significant microevolutionary adaptations, which balance the disadvantage of the ``rostral loss.{'' The present study aims to investigate the effect of such phenotypic variation on the reproductive traits of the species. We collected ovigerous females of H. sapphica in mixed (morph-A and morph-B) and unmixed populations (morph-A) along the species geographical range. We measured seven morphometric and maternal investment traits: carapace length, fecundity, embryo volume, egg density, female dry weight, brood dry weight, and reproductive output. Our results showed that ovigerous females were bigger in morph-A than in morph-B, whereas fecundity did not show any significant differences between the two morphotypes. High egg volume might be attributed to the latitudinal differences of our sampling sites compared to congenerics. Interestingly, the reproductive output was found to be bigger in morph-A specimens, suggesting that the maternal energy investment is selectively determined from the rostral presence/absence and the morphotype's higher viability in the species populations.",NA,2022,2022,NA,10.1155/2022/8342656,0947-5745,7,63,241,1735,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,A comprehensive appraisal of evolutionary diversity in venomous Asian coralsnakes of the genus Sinomicrurus (Serpentes: Elapidae) using Bayesian coalescent inference and supervised machine learning,"While species boundaries between conspicuously divergent populations of the medically important snake genus Sinomicrurus are well established, instances of erratic chromatic and meristic variation continue to confound taxonomists, since the mid-1800s. This predicament can be attributed to an inadequate molecular phylogenetic framework and the lack of a comprehensive taxonomic representation of geographic variants. Here, we revisit lineage delineation in this genus, drawing cohesive evidence from a plurality of data and analysis types, including a promising, yet taxonomically under-utilized, supervised machine learning algorithm (random forest). Overall, this study incorporates data generated by molecular analyses as well as morphometrics and comparative anatomy based on 236 specimens from 28 different natural history collections examined by us, and an additional 161 records from 47 other sources. Our results indicate several very divergent evolutionary lineages concealed as subspecies. Thus, to better reflect this phylogenetic diversity, we raise S. macclellandi iwasakii from the southern Ryukyus and S. m. swinhoei from Taiwan to full species, and resurrect S. annularis. We highlight the need to distinguish at species level the current subspecies of S. japonicus, namely as, S. japonicus and S. boettgeri, and provide diagnostic characters to that end. On the other hand, given unpersuasive support of lineage independence, we sink Taiwanese S. hatori into S. sauteri and S. nigriventer into S. macclellandi. We also meticulously redescribe S. peinani from mainland China and Vietnam based on a substantial number of additional specimens, while synonymizing the recently described S. houi under S. kelloggi.

JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,A new terraranan genus from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest with comments on the systematics of Brachycephaloidea (Amphibia: Anura),"``Eleutherodactylus{''} bilineatus has long been an enigma. Recent phylogenetic analyses have recovered this species as part of a clade including Barycholos and Noblella, but the relationship among these groups still remains contentious. In this study, we test the phylogenetic position and reassess the taxonomic status of this long-term incertae sedis species. We use phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequences and data for external morphology and osteology of ``E.{''} bilineatus and its related genera. We recover the species as an independent lineage forming a fully supported clade with Barycholos and Noblella. The combination of inferred relationships and morphological traits supports the erection of a new genus that we name and diagnose. Our analyses also recover a non-monophyletic Noblella and the species of the genus, although morphologically similar, are part of different clades: one including species from central Andes and the other one including species from northern Andes. Moreover, distribution patterns point out connections among distant biogeographical areas of South America and a widespread distribution of an ancestor for the clade including Barycholos, ``E.{'' bilineatus, and Noblella. We also compare the relationships among clades of Brachycephaloidea and, hence, the family and subfamily classifications in different studies. We show that the family classification is probably far from becoming stable, mostly due to arbitrary selections of hierarchy of the clades.

In this study, the entire family of Pherusellidae is revised with description of two new species, Pherusella minima from the Mediterranean Sea and Pherusella liowae from Singapore. Serial semithin sections and 3-D reconstruction are used for the first time on an entire family of bryozoans. Soft-tissue morphology yields numerous characters such as details of the digestive tract, duplicature bands, and pore-plate structure that are useful and necessary for species identification. Cystid characters alone are regarded as insufficient for proper species recognition. Numerous previous studies have reported Pherusella tubulosa from Asia, but probably have misidentified this species. Hence, it appears to be restricted to the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.

In this study, we performed a broad sampling of Hypostomus in NMA and SF to investigate the interspecific boundaries and phylogenetic relationships using a multilocus approach based on one mitochondrial and three nuclear markers. Seven genetic groups were found for both ecoregions, in addition to one lineage exclusive to the SF represented by populations of the species Hypostomus velhochico. Moreover, multilocus analyses validated 16 formally described species and two new lineages for the NMA and SF ecoregions, as well as putative cases of species complexes.

Despite these harsh conditions, some specialized species thrive in this extreme habitat. Misonne's spider gecko, Rhinogecko misonnei de Witte, 1973 (Reptilia, Squamata, Gekkonidae) is an endemic species that is native to the central part of the Lut Desert. This research aimed to explore the dietary gut content and ecology of Misonne's spider gecko populations inhabiting the Lut Desert. A DNA metabarcoding approach was applied to obtain data from the stomach content of six collected specimens. A total of 147,451 amplicon reads representing a total of 94 OTU (=Operational Taxonomic Units) for the CO1-5P barcode region were sequenced. Of 94 OTUs, 50 (53.2\%) identically matched >= 97\% with BOLD and/or NCBI database and were identified at the genus level. Blasting in both databases revealed the presence of three phyla including Chordata (55.23\%), Arthropoda (44.72\%), and Annelida (0.05). 99.54\% of Chordata DNA belonged to Rhinogecko misonnei mainly coming from stomach tissue of the examined specimens. Within the arthropods, 87.64\% of the OTUs matched Insecta and 12.08\% Arachnida. Our findings indicate that Rhinogecko misonnei is a generalist gecko that feeds on a variety of food items. About 81\% of Rhinogecko food items in the central Lut are migratory insects that come from adjacent areas of the Lut District, although the arachnid food items originate from the central Lut.

JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,"An integrative approach uncovered variation within Trapelus ruderatus (Olivier, 1804) (Squamata: Agamidae) in Western Asia","The Agamid lizard Trapelus ruderatus has a large distribution in western Asia. There is as yet neither a comprehensive molecular phylogeny nor morphological variation studies on populations of this species. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the morphology and genetic attributes of this species from populations in Iran, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. For the morphological examination, 18 characters (nine metric, eight meristic, and one ratio characters) were examined on all specimens. The populations were divided into four Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs; three in Iran and one in Turkey). The Iraqi population was distinguished as Trapelus persicus by morphological characters. Morphological analyses confirmed that all OTUs could be considered as distinct and that the Turkey population is clearly separated from the Iranian populations. In the genetic component of the project, two mitochondrial (Cytb and ND2) gene fragments were used to reveal phylogenetic relationships among the populations. Molecular phylogenetic reconstruction showed five distinct clades (three in Iran, one in southeastern Turkey, and one in central-southern Turkey-western Syria). Iraqi populations clustered with T. persicus, with high genetic distances from all other populations, as seen using morphological data. Based on the molecular genetic analyses, southeastern Turkey and central-southern Turkey-Syrian populations are clearly distinct (8.4\% mean distance) and far from the type population in Iran. This suggests that they should be considered as different taxa. Iranian populations were differentiated into three major groups, the type population in Fars Province and two others in northwest and western Iran. The morphological and molecular genetic results gave a similar output with three Iranian populations having minor divergence, but being clearly separated from the population in Turkey. We suggest each of these groups should be considered as full species. According to divergence time estimation, T. ruderatus firstly diverged at 26.5 mya and subsequently diversified due to the uplifting of the Zagros Mountains and Anatolian Diagonal 15 mya.

JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,Biodiversity modelling reveals a significant gap between diversity hotspots and protected areas for Iranian reptiles,"The global struggle to conserve as many species as possible with limited resources requires an improvement of our knowledge on the distribution of biodiversity. In Iran, the state of knowledge is poor for most groups of organisms, except few vertebrate groups and vascular plants. Reptiles are one of the best known, most diverse vertebrate groups in Iran, with a high rate of endemism (ca. 29\%), but distribution patterns and related environmental drivers remain poorly understood. In the present study, based on a large publicly available dataset, we use general additive modelling (GAM) to identify explanatory variables for species richness of reptiles in Iran. Results indicate heterogeneity parameters (range +entropy) as the variables with the highest explanatory values. Based on the grid cells of the predicted environmental richness, using hotspot analysis, we suggest seven hotspots of reptile diversity (HRDs) across the country. Our results corroborate the previously recognized HRDs and detect three additional ones, located alongside the major mountain ranges around the central deserts plateau, particularly in the Zagros Mountains. Four of the largest HRDs (ca. 90\%) situate within the Irano-Anatolian and Caucasus global biodiversity hotspot. In addition, our results reveal a large gap between identified HRDs and the current network of protected areas (PAs) in the country. While three of the detected HRDs in this study are partially touched (ca. 18\%) by the PA network, overall, these areas are only covered by less than 10\%.

Defining biodiversity of bat species can help conservation biologists to prioritize areas for bat conservation. In this study, we assembled distribution records of all bats of Iran to generate the first richness map of bats, as no richness map is available for bat species in the country. By constructing generalized linear models, we determined which historical and environmental factors drive the richness of bat species across the country. Results of richness mapping showed that Zagros Mountains host the highest number of species in Iran. We found that precipitation is the most influential variable in shaping bat richness in Iran by explaining 26\% of variation in species richness. Topographic heterogeneity, with 19\% of explained variance, was the second most important determinant of bat richness. We also estimated bat assemblage similarity among the biomes in the country. Temperate Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands biome was the most distinct biome based on bat assemblage. On the other hand, Montane Grasslands and Shrublands and Deserts and Xeric Shrublands were the most similar biomes based upon distributions of the bat species. Areas that were identified to have higher species diversity were regions with high priority for the conservation of bat biodiversity in the country.

Their wide morphological, behavioral, and ecological diversity is remarkable, making them subject of basic and applied studies. The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) proposed as a DNA barcode for Metazoa is used in species discovery and identification, relying on threshold values to split intra- and interspecific sequences and a comprehensive library to accurate identification. Here, we scanned all the pentatomomorphan cox1 sequences on Barcode of Life Data System library aiming to provide an overview of available data; verify barcoding gaps at generic level; infer individual empirical threshold values to distinguish congeneric species; and test efficiency of cox1 based on the Probability of Correct Identification (PCI) analysis. Our final dataset comprised 12,189 sequences, covering five superfamilies, 32 families, 460 genera, and 1068 species. The dataset abundance and composition were biased to families with economic importance, that is, Pentatomidae, Lygaeidae, Scutelleridae, Coreidae, and Rhyparochromidae. Barcode gaps were detected for most of the analyzed genera, reaffirming the efficiency of cox1 for Pentatomomorpha. We inferred threshold values for 131 genera and found a global PCI of 74.33\%, suggesting that one out of four analyzed species suffer from operational biases or hide cryptic species.

JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,Brain morphological adaptations of Gambusia affinis along climatic gradients in China,"Many studies have confirmed the impact of the environment on the brain. However, it is still controversial whether the cause of the change is phenotypically plastic or heritable. In this study, we studied morphological variations of the brain among Gambusia affinis obtained from 10 different populations in China. We found that the sizes of total brain and brain regions were affected by climatic gradients. For instance, there was a decrease in the volume of olfactory bulbs, optic tectum, corpus cerebelli, and total brain from north to south. Common-garden experiments indicated that the variations in the sizes of the hypothalamus and the total brain were heritable, while that of other brain regions were phenotypically plastic. Variation in brain morphology of wild fish supports the mosaic hypothesis. The common-garden experiments provide a reference for heritability estimates and phenotypic plasticity of brain volumes. In addition, our study has laid the foundation for in-depth research on the adaptive evolution of the brain of G. affinis.",brain; climatic gradients; Gambusia affinis; heritability; phenotypic plasticity,2021,59,8,10.1111/jzs.12544,0947-5745,11,85,161,1053,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,Application of a quantitative PCR method for monitoring of geosmin-producing Anabaena spp. in a Japanese reservoir,"Cyanobacteria blooms occur frequently in lakes and reservoirs worldwide and the blooms are often accompanied by changes in the taste and odor of the water caused by cyanobacterial metabolites, such as geosmin. The amount of geosmin in drinking water in Japan is limited legally and requires regular monitoring. The approaches for detecting geosmin are generally based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which requires experienced personnel or sophisticated instrumentation. Here, we applied a TaqMan probe method for detecting geosmin-producing cyanobacteria, Anabaena (Dolichospermum) spp. in a Japanese reservoir. Quantitative PCR amplification using the methods which targeted geosmin synthase gene, worked successfully and the DNA concentrations may correspond with both the number of Anabaena spp. cells and the geosmin concentration. The tests of suitable glass microfiber filters for monitoring Anabaena spp. revealed that the samples filtered through GF/D (particle retention size 2.7 mu m) yielded significantly higher concentrations of Anabaena DNA compared with the samples filtered through the GF/F and GF/A.",Water quality; Cyanobacteria; TaqMan probe; Glass microfiber filter,2023,19,"1, SI",10.1007/s11355-022-00533-7,1860-1871,16,114,158,1134,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,Basin-scale spatiotemporal distribution of ayu Plecoglossus altivelis and its relationship with water temperature from summer growth to autumn spawning periods,"As climate warming progresses, it becomes necessary to study the effects of water temperature on the basin-scale dynamic distribution of riverine fish. This study examined the spatiotemporal distribution of Plecoglossus altivelis using the environmental DNA approach and its relationship with water temperature from summer growth to autumn spawning periods in the Nagara River basin, central Japan. The overall results of the spatiotemporal distribution of P. altivelis were consistent with the known life history: a wide-range distribution in the basin during summer and aggregation in the middle mainstem during autumn. Additionally, this study found three intriguing distribution patterns depending on water temperature. During summer (August), the warmest period, P. altivelis was distributed in the upper mainstem, one tributary, and the mainstem downstream of the tributary confluences in relation to the relatively colder water (< 25 degrees C). During early autumn (September-early October), it spread widely in the middle and upper mainstem without the constraint of the upper limit of water temperature. During late autumn (late October-November), it steadily aggregated to the middle mainstem because of downstream migration for spawning at water temperatures below 20 degrees C. This study suggests the importance of river connectivity for P. altivelis migration to suitable habitats during its freshwater life stages, upper mainstem and tributaries as summer growth habitats, and cooling effects of tributaries on the mainstem during mid-summer.",Global warming; Environmental DNA; Spawning migration; Sweet fish; Water temperature,2023,19,"1, SI",10.1007/s11355-022-00509-7,1860-1871,20,159,223,1558,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,Development of environmental DNA chip for monitoring the invasive alien fishes in dam reservoirs,"Control and prevention of invasive alien species (IAS) are important issues for the environmental management of dam reservoirs. Recently, environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has been used for monitoring IAS in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, as a simple and user-friendly eDNA method for monitoring IAS, we developed an eDNA chip analysis for monitoring three IAS, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu and bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, in dam reservoirs. The eDNA chip analysis using each IAS-specific primer and probe only amplified and detected the target species. The developed eDNA chip detected three IAS from water samples collected in five dam reservoirs, indicating that eDNA chip analysis can be used as a monitoring tool for IAS. However, IAS were not detected by the eDNA chip at some survey sites where the qPCR assays showed low eDNA concentrations, indicating a lower sensitivity of the eDNA chip at low eDNA concentrations. For the establishment of an eDNA chip for biomonitoring, some challenges faced by other techniques like qPCR and metabarcoding remain, such as sensitivity at low target concentrations and ``real-time{''} detections in the field and further improvement of performance in eDNA chip will be required.",eDNA; DNA microarray; Alien species; Reservoir; Real-time qPCR,2023,19,"1, SI",10.1007/s11355-022-00513-x,1860-1871,14,96,194,1284,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,Diurnal detection of environmental DNA of the semi-aquatic water shrew Chimarrogale platycephala using 25-h water sampling in streams,"Whether environmental DNA (eDNA) testing methods are effective for semi-aquatic organisms that spend time both in rivers and on land remains unclear. We designed a species-specific primer-probe set for the semi-aquatic Japanese water shrew, Chimarrogale platycephala, an endangered top predator species for which limited ecological information is available. The designed primer-probe set was used to determine the effective sampling time for detecting eDNA from this species in running water. Hourly water sampling was conducted for 25 h in the autumn of 2020. Water sampling and camera trapping were conducted in the two streams in which feces had been observed on stream rocks. No C. platycephala activity was captured by the camera traps at any sampling point during the investigation. However, eDNA was mainly detected at night in both streams and twice during the daytime in one stream; the eDNA detection periods differed between streams (21:00-23:00 vs. 1:00-8:00 and daytime). These results demonstrate that eDNA testing methods are effective for detecting small semi-aquatic mammals. However, the sampling time affected the results, and eDNA was mostly detected at night, possibly because of the nocturnal activity of the species. Therefore, the sampling time should be adjusted to match the activity period of a species to improve the efficiency of eDNA testing for semi-aquatic organisms.",Environmental DNA; Species-specific primer-probe; Sampling time; Quantitative PCR; Endangered species,2023,19,"1, SI",10.1007/s11355-022-00526-6,1860-1871,18,133,211,1399,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,Error estimation of trunk diameter and tree height measured with a backpack LiDAR system in Japanese plantation forests,"Trunk biomass in a forest is necessary information for good forest management. The trunk biomass is usually calculated by an allometric formula using trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (TH) as non-destructive input values. To confirm the measurement errors of a backpack LiDAR system in forest inventory, DBH and TH values obtained by the LiDAR system were compared with conventional survey data from Japanese plantation forests. Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) and Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) form large plantation forests in Japan. The backpack LiDAR system was used in five plots of these species-dominated forests (20 m x 20 m for each plot). The tree detection rates were 100\% in all plots. The relative RMSEs of the DBH and TH estimations ranged from 6.8 to 10.0\% and 5.4-10.1\%, respectively. The negative biases indicated underestimation of DBH and TH. The DBH and TH results of the present study were close to those obtained using the backpack LiDAR approach in previous studies. The paper demonstrated a fully automated solution for measuring DBH and TH using the backpack LiDAR system. The solution showed that the system has a distinct capability as an efficient and practical tool for forest inventory and management.",DBH; Forest inventory; Japanese cedar; Japanese cypress; Point cloud; Wearable device,2023,19,"1, SI",10.1007/s11355-022-00530-w,1860-1871,18,119,200,1269,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,Nutrients' distribution during fertigation of a felt-based living wall,"The lack of space in cities has favoured the development of vertical gardens in indoor and outdoor environments. For an adequate development and appearance of the plants in these living walls, it is necessary to provide nutrients (usually by means of fertigation). One of the main limitations is the difficulty in obtaining a uniform distribution of nutrients, especially in felt systems. The objective of this research was to identify whether the distribution of nutrients (particularly iron and phosphorous) applied by fertigation in a felt living wall depended on the species used and the location of the plants in height. Three modules of a Fytotextile (R) felt-based living wall were used, each module containing three columns of different species: Soleirolia soleirolii, Philodendron hederaceum, and Nephrolepis exaltata. Fertigation was applied using a Hoagland-Arnon solution for 4 months. Measurements of leaf area, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), chlorophyll meter readings (CMR), fresh and dry weight, and P and Fe concentration were carried out for each of the plants. Comparing variables within the same species at different heights showed no significant differences in the variables. This means that the distribution of nutrients along the living wall (especially in height) was uniform. It is important to note that these results could vary for other types of living walls or for other configurations of the fertigation system.",Fertilization; Vertical greening systems; Green wall; Iron; Phosphorous,2023,19,"1, SI",10.1007/s11355-022-00529-3,1860-1871,9,70,221,1457,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

However, it is necessary to explore these issues in an integrated manner for more comprehensive and efficient planting plans. This study addresses a tree-selection optimization problem incorporating variables for planting planning in a mathematical model. Three scenarios are evaluated: minimizing costs, maximizing CO2 absorption, and maximizing species diversity. The proposed optimal tree selection model is applied to a park in an apartment complex. Based on the case study, optimal tree species are selected very efficiently to satisfy various objective functions.

To prevent its extinction, effective ecological survey methods are necessary in order to guide habitat management. Recently, environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has proven useful for detection and censusing of endangered aquatic species that are difficult to locate and capture. In this study, we developed and evaluated a semi-quantitative system to track R. a. suigensis using eDNA. We designed primers and a fluorescent probe specific to the mitochondrial gene for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND-1) of R. a. suigensis for quantitative real-time PCR. We first confirmed the utility of this analysis in aquarium experiments, before performing field surveys. We sampled water for eDNA analysis and set fish traps at 48 points in an agricultural channel in the Ashida River basin, inhabited by R. a. suigensis, and examined the relationship between fish occurrence and eDNA concentration. The concentration was correlated with the distance downstream from the point where specimens of R. a. suigensis were captured, indicating that the eDNA concentration reflects distribution and abundance of R. a. suigensis.

Because the word ``culture{''} brings with it deep complexities, there is a need to understand varying contexts in looking for suitable strategies toward the advancement of cycling culture. The stage for cycling culture is the landscape where cycling infrastructure can be properly provided. With development, an influential element would be economic capacity. The paper explores the influence of the economic development divide by comparing cyclist perception between developed and developing countries, namely Taiwan and the Philippines. An online survey between 122 Taiwanese and 111 Filipino cyclists was conducted to find out the landscape needs of people to consider cycling transport based on affordances in the landscape. The variables selected were based on landscape elements for cycling as a commuting activity. The data were processed through factor analysis to reveal latent landscape needs to profile cycling needs.

LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,Atmospheric deposition of Pb and Cd in the Cedrus atlantica for environmental biomonitoring,"Atmospheric heavy metal deposition is widely occurring due to anthropogenic effects such as industrial activities and motor vehicles. As a result, it has increased significantly and reached a level that threatens human health and the environment. Among these deposition factors, it is of great importance to monitor the atmospheric concentrations of heavy metals that do not easily degrade in nature, tend to bioaccumulate, and can be toxic even at low concentration levels. Biomonitoring is one of the most impressive passive methods in determining the change of heavy metal concentrations in the atmosphere. This study investigates the effect of anthropogenic emission sources in urban areas using tree rings as a biomonitor. Cedrus atlantica was selected, because it is generally preferred in parks, roadside and landscape design. Samples were collected from parks near the road, densely populated, and close to the small-scale industry in Kastamonu, Turkiye. Atmospheric deposition of Lead (Pb) and Cadmium (Cd) in organs were analyzed based on years and directions. Their accumulation in the outer bark was determined to be quite high (Cd value is 2226.2 ppb and Pb value is 38201.1 ppb) compared to other organs.

They are also ecosystems which provide biodiversity as part of the green infrastructure. To evaluate greenspaces as ecosystems, seventeen urban greenspaces in Yokohama, Japan, were selected to conduct surveys of flora and construct a vegetation table. The present study investigated the number of woody plant species; their growth form (tree, shrub, or liana); the ratio of evergreen to deciduous plants; and whether plant species were native, exotic, wild, or planted. The greenspaces were compared with the control area, Enkaizan, a suburban greenspace within Yokohama and representative of Satoyama (a traditional landscape model with sustainable living space). The comparison used cluster analysis to match the correlation of identified species in each greenspace and split them into four groups: (1) natural, (2) quasi-natural, (3) quasi-artificial, and (4) artificial.

Due to serious depopulation and aging trends in East Asia, including Japan, few people are being involved in managing green areas and conserving biodiversity. Depending on specific events and age groups that contribute to the experience, knowledge, and preferences of citizens, green area management and biodiversity conservation activities can be effectively conducted through strong collaborations between various stakeholders and generations. We aimed to understand the differences in the perceptions of citizens, belonging to different generations in the metropolitan Nagoya City, towards the Satoyama areas in Japan through an online survey. The status of Satoyama areas is reflected by the rare species of endangered category II in the Act on Conservation of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Analyzing the perceptions revealed gaps in the experience, knowledge, and preference between different age groups for various management and conservation activities. In addition to the intergenerational gaps, gaps between different household income levels and the duration of the activities were identified.

The ways in which to explore a comprehensive and efficient ecological health functional greenway plant landscape model are of particular importance for greenway construction and community belt park management. In the present study, nine landscape configuration patterns of three green space structure types (trees-shrubs-grass, trees-grass, and shrubs-grass) in typical community demonstrative belt park greenways in Changchun Fitness Park in Beijing were selected as the study objects on which to perform quantitative study and evaluation of the single and comprehensive effects of six core ecological health factors, namely green space landscape beauty degree, negative air ions, human comfort, PM2.5, and bacteria and noise reduction.

LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,Effects of advance and retreat of agricultural landscapes on Rana japonica and R. ornativentris,"Paddy fields are essential habitats for frogs. We evaluated the impacts of both farmland consolidation including agricultural road improvement and farmland abandonment on the two Rana species using a model incorporating spatial autocorrelation. A sampling unit consists of several paddy fields that share a ditch and are isolated from other blocks by roads or other land covers. We surveyed 619 blocks in an area of about 1000 km(2) from the plain to the mountains of Toyota City in central Japan. Among them, 124 blocks included at least a flooded paddy field where frogs could lay eggs. R. ornativentris and R. japonica bred in 50 and 25 blocks, respectively. We constructed models to explain the presence/absence of two species by GLM (non-spatial model) and hierarchical Bayesian model with INLA (spatial model) that includes spatial autocorrelation as a random effect. Explanatory variables of the local scale were the altitude, location of the paddy field (yatsuda (valley bottom paddy fields) or non-yatsuda), farmland consolidated or not consolidated, and under cultivation or abandoned. Those of the landscape scale were areas of forest and paddy fields, and road density in 14 circles with different radius from 50 to 2000 m. Both species' distribution had significant spatial autocorrelation. The spatial model had a higher discriminative ability than the non-spatial model. Farmland consolidation and the forest area in the 400 m radius had a positive effect on R. ornativentris. Altitude and road density in the 50 m radius had negative effects, cultivation had a positive effect, and farmland consolidation and yatsuda had no or negative effects on R. japonica.

Traditional rigid defense methods cannot meet the needs of modern disaster mitigation and should shift to resilience approaches. However, most existing resilience studies stopped at qualitative analysis and static evaluation. Quantitative evaluation of dynamic resilience is quite rare. In this study, focusing on flood resilience, we applied the process-based ``Robustness-Resistance-Recovery (3Rs){''} quantitative assessment framework, and used the Dongting Lake Basin as an empirical area. The results showed that the resilience of the whole Dongting Lake Basin was high, but the Dongting Lake Eco-economic Zone had poor flood resilience. The low value of robustness was concentrated in the north and central part of Hunan Province, affected by the distribution of water systems. The resistance was relatively low and the administrative units with the top two low levels accounted for 61.99\%, while the recovery level was high with obvious good performance in the west. In addition, the synergy of robustness and resistance dominated the flood resilience.

LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,"A virtual reality investigation of factors influencing landscape preferences: Natural elements, emotions, and media creation","Understanding natural landscape preferences is essential to creating attractive green spaces that promote the benefits people may receive from nature. Previous research on landscape preference has primarily relied on quantitative, theory-driven approaches that may neglect complex and detailed human feelings and thoughts, as well as still images, which may not represent moving immersive stimuli representative of real-world experiences. The current study sought to reveal the key reasons for landscape preferences using virtual reality (VR) and openended questions. Ninety-five university students in the U.S. watched six 360 degrees videos of natural environments from Costa Rica and the U.S. We found that tropical beaches and rainforests were the favorite and the least favored landscapes in our sample, respectively. Preference rankings were explained by natural elements, emotional responses, and to a lesser degree, the creation of the 360 degrees videos. Sounds, water, coastal elements, and feeling relaxed were the most frequent reasons for ``favoriting{''} a video; greenery and feeling bored were the most frequent reasons for ``least favoring{''} a video. Low arousal emotions (i.e., relaxing, boring) and multiple scene transitions played important roles in explaining preferences. The results demonstrated the relevance of landscape preference theories while suggesting a greater emphasis on open views, sounds, and rhythmic features of the coast for landscape planning and design.",Natural environments; Natural elements; Preference; Virtual reality; Emotional responses,2023,230,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104616,0169-2046,15,124,212,1497,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,An urban cast of characters: Landscape use and cover influencing mammal occupancy in an American midwestern city,"With future human population growth concentrating in urban areas, cities are working to counterbalance ecological disturbances resulting from development by incorporating green space that supports greater biodiversity. An initial line of inquiry into designing wildlife-inclusive green space involves evaluating landscapes that are associated with the habitat use of urban species. In this study, we utilized occupancy modeling to estimate select terrestrial mammal presence in a fast-growing mid-sized midwestern city to determine possible taxa-specific associations with multiple land use and cover variables, specifically those associated with higher degrees of human activity. Using motion-triggered infrared trail cameras over eight seasons from winter 2017 to fall 2018, we applied a single-species, single -season stacked design to estimate occupancy for eight urban dwelling mammals. Taxa-specific models contained one of three possible detection variables (null, percent green space, or percent impervious surface) and combinations of three species-specific variables, natural and anthropogenic. We hypothesized that large species, coyote (Canis latrans) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), would exhibit the most positive association to natural land cover and the most negative association to anthropogenic land cover. We also hypothesized that small and medium sized species, eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), would demonstrate a neutral association to land cover type, anthropogenic or natural. Our results indicated that the presence of anthropogenic features rather than any particular natural land cover may be driving wildlife distribution in our study area, as none of our species demonstrated a positive association to natural land cover (percent recreation, residential yards, vacant land, or woodland). Species with a wide range of body sizes, showed a negative association with residential yards, indicating that this type of green space may be an unnecessary or unsuitable subsidizing resource in our study area. With our results in mind, we recommend increasing the amount of natural or less manicured green space to offset the intensity of impervious surface as well as encouraging the establishment of native vegetation in existing and newly con-structed residential development to better connect urban green space and residential yards to larger adjoining tracts of natural landscapes. For our study area and other cities in similar phases of development, these suggestions may be essential first steps to reduce biodiversity loss and strengthen community ecology as urban areas continue to grow.",NA,2023,229,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104582,0169-2046,17,112,391,2803,NA,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Developing a Multi-sensory Public Participation GIS (MSPPGIS) method for integrating landscape values and soundscapes of urban green infrastructure,"This paper develops, tests and validates a Multi-sensory Public Participation GIS (MSPPGIS) method combining the qualities of soundscapes and landscape values mapping. The development of the method involved: a) Public Participation GIS survey design; b) three-phase evaluation of survey addressing analytical, applicability and usability criteria; c) survey refinement; d) sampling and data collection, and; e) spatial data analysis. The analysis consisted of hotspot mapping involving Kernel Density Estimation, spatial overlap assessment using Jaccard coefficients and value compatibility analysis showing the level of spatial compatibility between positive landscape values and positive and negative soundscapes. Results indicated very low to low spatial overlap between the different landscape values and pleasant/unpleasant sound hotspots, suggesting that landscape values do not necessarily reflect sonic perception of urban green and blue spaces. Pleasant and unpleasant sounds were located closer to home than landscape values (except for urban life values), indicating that respondents' soundscape `cognitive map' is smaller in spatial range. The MSPPGIS method enables the elicitation of a more dynamic and diverse set of sounds compared to previous soundscape mapping which tend to focus on `noise' instead of multiple experiences of different sounds. Also, the combination of landscape values and soundscapes in MSPPGIS provides for a more integrated assessment of `where' and `how' to design urban green infrastructure.",NA,2023,230,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104617,0169-2046,18,147,212,1532,NA,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Emergency department visits for mental disorders and the built environment: Residential greenspace and historical redlining,"The built environment has been increasingly shown to impact mental health. However, little is known about how and the extent to which exposure to greenspace in the residential environment is associated with emergency department visits for mental disorders. In addition, despite recent findings highlighting the links between his-torical discriminatory housing policies and health outcomes, no evidence is available regarding historical red-lining and mental health. We aimed to investigate the extent to which the availability of greenspace in residential surroundings and historical redlining was associated with risks of mental disorder-related emergency department visits. In this ecological study, we analyzed state-wide data on emergency room visits for mental health in all metropolitan areas in Texas between 2016 and 2019. Greenspace coverage was determined using the National Land Cover Database. Historical redlining was defined as the type C (definitely declining) or D (hazardous) designations according to the 1930 s Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) Security Maps. We fitted a conditional autoregressive spatial model with zero truncated negative binomial distribution to assess associations among emergency department visits, greenspace availability, and redlining, adjusted for risk and protective urban and social-demographic factors. We found that, with a 1\% increase in greenspace coverage in a zip code area, the risk of emergency department visits due to mental health disorders was expected to decrease by 0.16\% (IRR = 0.9984, 95\% CI: 0.9971-0.9997). Meanwhile, a 1\% increase of historically redlining zones was associated with a 0.88\% increase (IRR = 1.0088, 95\% CI: 1.0056-1.0120) in the risk of emergency department visits for mental health disorders. Our findings support the notion that exposure to natural environments is linked to lower risks of emergency department visits for mental disorders. They also indicate that systematic segregation insti-tutionalized by historical housing policies might be related to present-day mental health-related emergency department visits. This study offers novel insights into the built environmental correlates of mental health and provides planning and policy implications related to mental health and health equity promotion.",Mental health; Mental disorders; Greenspace; Redlining,2023,230,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104568,0169-2046,15,123,325,2303,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Olympic effects on reshaping urban greenspace of host cities,"The Olympic Games are one of the most influential mega-events worldwide, yet little is known about the extent how these events transform the physical appearance of urban greenspaces. To fill this knowledge gap, we use time-series satellite images to map annual greenspace distribution across eight host cities of the Summer Olympics between 1988 and 2016, and quantify changes in greenspace coverage, exposure, and landscape before and after the games. By further applying a difference-in-differences model, we unravel the underlying causal impacts of Olympic Games on urban greening. Results show that Olympic Games not only promote overall in-creases in greenspace coverage but also enhance people's ambient exposure to greenspace, of which the influ-encing magnitude is more evident nearby Olympic venues and the associated buffers. We also find urban greenspace landscape generally becomes more irregular and disaggregated after the Games. Statistically, Olympic-associated urban modifications directly contribute to a 3.41 \% increment in greenspace coverage within the urban extent (p < 0.01). Our findings indicate the widespread Olympic effects on reshaping urban green -spaces, which provide new insights on maintaining Olympic sustainability and facilitating green city development.",Olympic sustainability; Urban greenspace; Spectral unmixing; Landsat; Exposure assessment; Difference-in-differences,2023,230,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104615,0169-2046,9,60,184,1292,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Research note: Associations between the implementation of communal open space design guidelines and residents' use of these spaces in apartment developments,"Background: Communal open spaces (COS) in apartment developments can be an important resource for residents, but little is known about the implementation of COS policy design requirements and its impact on residents' use of these spaces. Methods: Apartment design policies across three Australian states (NSW, Victoria and Western Australia) were screened for quantifiable policy requirements relating to COS. Building plans for 112 apartment complexes across Sydney, Melbourne and Perth were scored for the implementation of state level and total (i.e., pooled) policy requirements. Residents of these buildings also completed a self-report survey on their use of COS. Results: Strong positive associations were found between COS policy implementation scores and COS use, with the NSW and `total' policy implementation scores demonstrating the strongest effect. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that more comprehensive design guidance is important for delivering COS that appeals to apartment residents.",Communal open space; Policy implementation; Design guidelines; Apartment buildings; Resident use; Australia,2023,230,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104613,0169-2046,21,156,142,1004,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Transforming US urban green infrastructure planning to address equity,"Cities across the Unites States have embraced green infrastructure (GI) in official planning efforts. The plans conceptualize GI as providing multiple functions and benefits for urban residents, and form part of complex responses to intersectional urban challenges of social injustice and inequity, climate change, aging and expensive infrastructure, and socio-economic change. To date, it is unclear whether official city GI programs address systemic racism and urban inequality. To fill this knowledge gap, we coded and analyzed 122 formal plans from 20 US cities to examine if and how they address equity and justice in three domains: visions, processes, and distributions. We find a widespread failure of plans to conceptualize and operationalize equity planning prin-ciples. Only 13\% of plans define equity or justice. Only 30\% of cities recognize that they are on Native land. Over 90\% of plans do not utilize inclusive processes to plan, design, implement, or evaluate GI, and so target many communities for green improvements without their consent. Although 80\% of plans use GI to manage hazards and provide multiple benefits with GI, less than 10\% identify the causes of uneven distributions and vulnera-bility. Even fewer recognize related issues of houselessness and gentrification. Very few plans have mechanisms to build community wealth through new GI jobs. We find promising seeds of best practices in some cities and plan types, but no plan exemplified best practices across all equity dimensions. If formal GI planning in US cities does not explicitly and comprehensively address equity concerns, it may reproduce the inequalities that GI is meant to alleviate. Based on our results, we identify-three key needs to improve current GI planning practices for green infrastructure and equity. First, clear definitions of equity and justice are needed, second, planning must engage with causes of inequality and displacement, and third, urban GI planning needs to be transformed through a focus on inclusion.",Equity; Green infrastructure; Urban planning; USA; Environmental justice,2023,229,NA,10.1016/j.lurbplan.2022.104591,0169-2046,9,69,309,2026,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,"Urban infrastructure expansion and artificial light pollution degrade coastal ecosystems, increasing natural-to-urban structural connectivity","Urbanization is provoking habitat loss and fragmentation, driving rapid landscape transformation worldwide. Remnant habitats in urban areas can be especially prone to degradation by human activities at short time scales, and poor planning during urban expansion can erode their structural and functional connectivity. Foredunes in particular are threatened significantly by human activities, including coastal urban infrastructure expansion, by bulldozing them and/or by interrupting their continuity across the shoreline, and also by associated light pollution. However, there is still scarce quantification about how urban processes determine changes in remnant habitat extent and modify the configuration of structural connectivity in coastal urban settings. Using an expanding conurbation located in north-central Chile (similar to 29 degrees S) as model system, we investigated the rate of coastal foredune loss and spatial fragmentation due to urban expansion, and the change in the type of structural connectivity, i.e. with other natural habitats vs with urban infrastructure. Based on map analyses of structural connectivity among habitats and with urban infrastructure through time, we estimated foredune habitat extent and fragmentation and their shared border with other habitats and built infrastructure during two time intervals, 2010-2015 and 2015-2020. Distribution and intensity of light pollution on present foredunes were also quantified in situ through field sampling. We found 36 \% decline in foredune area and increase in their connection with urban infrastructure. Urban wetlands and parallel dunes also experienced persistent area loss and increase in connection with urban infrastructure. Light pollution was intense in the foredune-beach ecotone. Given the rapid erosion of functional and structural connectivity of natural habitats, it becomes imperious to halt the reduction of remnant habitats and ecotones, and improve natural corridors in urban settings.",Coastal landscapes; Conurbation; Structural connectivity; Foredunes; Urbanization,2023,229,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104609,0169-2046,14,141,278,1986,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,A global analysis of multifaceted urbanization patterns using Earth Observation data from 1975 to 2015,"Urbanization as a global phenomenon is a multifaceted process. Here we do the first global attempt to characterize the complexity of urbanization from 1975 to 2015 in terms of population, built-up structure, and greenness per 5 x 5 km2 grid covering global inhabited areas, using Earth Observation data sources. Our results emphasize the multifaceted nature of urbanization that varies greatly across regions and times, in addition to the steady expansion of built-up land. Increased population density and built-up patch density were the dominant characteristics in Asia and Africa, while urbanization in Europe and North America took a rather steady pace, combined with widespread greening. According to the urbanization types identified by a self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm, a large proportion of urban and suburban areas experienced two dynamic urbanization types - built-up extension/leapfrog and built-up infill with large population increase. During different historical periods (1975-1990, 1990-2000, and 2000-2015), annual rates of increase in population and built-up density were slowing coinciding with an increasing greenness - signaling that urbanization processes are becoming less intense, more compact, and `greener' over the most recent period. Our findings facilitate the comprehensive understanding of global urbanization that is a complex process with many local variations and characteristics, and underscore the need for region-based strategies towards sustainable development instead of a `one-size-fitsall' policy for cities.",Built-up expansion; Population change; Greenness loss; Urbanization types; Social-land cover-environment interactions,2022,219,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104316,0169-2046,15,102,218,1553,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,A room with a view: Automatic assessment of window views for high-rise high-density areas using City Information Models and deep transfer learning,"Every windowed room has a view, which reflects the visibility of nature and landscape and has a strong influence on the health, living satisfaction, and housing value of inhabitants. Thus, automatic accurate window view assessment is vital in examining neighborhood landscape and optimizing the social and physical settings for sustainable urban development. However, existing methods are labor-intensive, inaccurate, and non-scalable to assess window views in high-rise, high-density cities. This study aims to assess Window View Indices (WVIs) quantitatively and automatically by using a photo-realistic City Information Model (CIM). First, we define four WVIs to represent the outside (i) greenery, (ii) water-body, (iii) sky, and (iv) construction views quantitatively. Then, we propose a deep transfer learning method to estimate the WVIs for the window views captured in the CIM. Preliminary experimental tests in Wan Chai District, Hong Kong confirmed that our method was highly satisfactory (R2 > 0.95) and fast (3.08 s per view), and the WVIs were accurate (RMSE < 0.042). The proposed approach can be used in computing city-scale window views for landscape management, sustainable urban planning and design, and real estate valuation.",Window view; View quality index; High-rise buildings; City information model; Deep learning; Urban computing,2022,226,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104505,0169-2046,22,146,184,1244,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Accounting for diversity: Exploring the inclusivity of recreation planning in the United Kingdom's protected areas,"Protected areas (PAs) deliver a wide variety of benefits to visitors including mental and physical health, environmental knowledge, and a sense of community. Unfortunately, many barriers have led to the underrepresentation of several socio-demographic groups within PAs (e.g., minority ethnic groups, those with disabilities). In the UK, a clear national mandate exists for designing more accessible outdoor spaces, but despite a growing understanding of the access barriers experienced by underrepresented groups, the institutional factors contributing to these barriers remain underexplored. To help alleviate this gap, we examined governing documents for UK PAs and surveyed PA managers to explore links between PA management approaches in the UK and access disparities. We found that diversity and inclusion objectives were seldom emphasized within management plans, yet most PA managers held clear concerns about the underrepresentation of several groups. We also identified several shortcomings in PA management that could impede the achievement of diversity targets. Most notably, PA organizations seldom targeted minority ethnic groups and rarely placed purposeful emphasis on the delivery of social benefits, instead prioritizing environmental knowledge which they most often linked to environmentalism. These findings reflect the Anglo-normative lens that has historically governed PA management in the UK. To fully embrace national diversity objectives, PA organizations should explicitly prioritize diversity and inclusion and integrate alternative worldviews related to the human-nature relationship.",Access; Equity; Outdoor recreation; Protected area management,2022,221,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104361,0169-2046,15,114,220,1613,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,"An exploration of factors characterising unusual spatial clusters of COVID-19 cases in the East Midlands region, UK: A geospatial analysis of ambulance 999 data","Complex interactions between physical landscapes and social factors increase vulnerability to emerging infections and their sequelae. Relative vulnerability to severe illness and/or death (VSID) depends on risk and extent of exposure to a virus and underlying health susceptibility. Identifying vulnerable communities and the regions they inhabit in real time is essential for effective rapid response to a new pandemic, such as COVID-19. In the period between first confirmed cases and the introduction of widespread community testing, ambulance records of suspected severe illness from COVID-19 could be used to identify vulnerable communities and regions and rapidly appraise factors that may explain VSID. We analyse the spatial distribution of more than 10,000 suspected severe COVID-19 cases using records of provisional diagnoses made by trained paramedics attending medical emergencies. We identify 13 clusters of severe illness likely related to COVID-19 occurring in the East Midlands of the UK and present an in-depth analysis of those clusters, including urban and rural dynamics, the physical characteristics of landscapes, and socio-economic conditions. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of VSID vary depending on wider geographic location.

LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,Assessing catchment-scale performance of in-stream Provisional Green Infrastructure interventions for Dry Weather Flows,"Provisional Green Infrastructure (PGI) refers to a range of instream intervention strategies that are currently being developed and deployed by non-state actors in the context of Indian megacities to supplement inefficient operation of grey infrastructures while providing localized multi-functional benefits. This study addresses how variations in the location and configuration of PGI interventions at the watershed catchment scale impact their cumulative performance in terms of contaminant removal efficiency, cost, and public accessibility using a SWMM-based TOPSIS approach. We consider 4 PGI upscaling scenarios in a 5.4 sq. km. watershed in the periphery of Bangalore, India: S1) Downgradient dispersed S2) Downgradient centralized S3) Upgradient dispersed S4) Upgradient centralized. Additionally, S0 was employed as a `control' scenario (in which no interventions are made), and S5 assumed the construction of a conventional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Total Suspended Solids (TSS) removal efficiencies ranged from 53\% to 97\% and performed better in upgradient locations. Total Phosphorus (TP) removal ranged from 59\% to 90\% and were less sensitive to catchment location, but were substantially improved in scenarios with dispersed configurations. Costs associated with PGI upscaling (4.2-6.3 million INR) were substantially lower than for S5 (37.5 million INR), and accessibility scores were considerably larger in upgradient PGI scenarios. Results suggest dispersed configurations of PGI interventions are optimal wherever such an approach is feasible. In cases where dispersed configurations prove unfeasible, centralized configurations should be placed preferentially in upgradient locations in the watershed, and in locations with higher pollutant concentrations and lower flow rates such as channels with shallower slopes. Authors emphasize PGI should not be viewed as a functional replacement for conventional wastewater treatment infrastructures, but rather as a supplementary stop-gap function in contexts where functional separation of wastewater and storm water are unlikely to occur, or where existing large scale WWTP's operate below their designed capacity.",SWMM; TOPSIS; Dry Weather Flows; Green Infrastructure; Megacity; Water quality,2022,226,NA,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104448,0169-2046,13,119,301,2192,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Influence of roads on space use by European hares in different landscapes,"Context Roads are ubiquitous in human inhabited landscapes, and can impact animal movement and population dynamics, due to barrier effects, road mortality, but also by providing resources at road verges. Thus, we need a better understanding of how roads, in interaction with seasonal changes in habitat structure, affect space use and habitat selection of the animals that persist in these landscapes. Objectives Here, we used the European hare (Lepus europaeus) as model species to investigate how human-induced changes in landscape composition-measured as road density, land cover type, and field size-affect home range location, seasonal habitat selection and road crossings, which are likely to correlate with wildlife-vehicle collision risk. Methods We collected > 240,000 GPS positions of 90 hares from three populations (one in Denmark and two in Germany) that differed regarding agricultural intensification and road density. Using this data, we analyzed home range location and habitat selection (using step-selection functions) in relation to roads, habitat composition, and seasonality, and quantified how these factors affected road crossings by hares. Results In comparatively more heterogeneous landscapes, hares established home ranges in areas with lower road densities compared to the surrounding area, but not in more simple landscapes. Moreover, hares generally avoided main roads and selected for minor roads during the vegetation growth seasons, especially in areas with comparatively less heterogeneous habitat structure. Hares crossed more main roads when moving greater distances, with movement distances being comparatively larger in simpler landscapes. Conclusions Our findings emphasize that it is important to distinguish between road types, as different roads can have different impacts on animals (e.g., small roads providing foraging opportunities via roadside vegetation and large roads being avoided). Moreover, animals in comparatively more heterogeneous landscapes are better able to adjust their habitat selection to avoid main roads than animals inhabiting simpler landscapes. More generally, homogenous landscapes increase the space use requirements of animals, leading to increased probability of road crossings, which in turn might affect population dynamics via increased road mortality risk.",Agricultural intensification; GPS; Habitat fragmentation; Habitat selection; Lepus europaeus; Road ecology,2023,38,1,10.1007/s10980-022-01552-3,0921-2973,12,73,328,2333,6,NA,250,6,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Monitoring changes in landscape structure in the Adirondack-to-Laurentians (A2L) transboundary wildlife linkage between 1992 and 2018: Identifying priority areas for conservation and restoration,"Context Although many species have transboundary geographic ranges, most conservation initiatives do not cross political boundaries. The landscape between the Adirondack Mountains in New York and the Laurentian Mountains in Quebec includes one of three potential north-south transboundary wildlife movement linkages that connect wilderness areas in northeastern USA and southeastern Canada. Although this region still maintains habitats of high ecological integrity and biodiversity, increasing land-cover changes and fragmentation are putting landscape connectivity at risk. Objectives We measured changes in landscape composition and configuration within the Adirondack-to-Laurentians transboundary wildlife linkage (A2L) between 1992 and 2018 to identify priority areas for conservation and restoration. Methods Land-cover change was calculated by measuring area and proportion of land-cover classes, and landscape fragmentation was determined by measuring patch number, mean patch size, the effective mesh size, and road density, at three spatial scales and four fragmentation geometries (i.e., combinations of fragmenting elements). Results Extensive changes in land-cover and landscape fragmentation occurred within the A2L between 1992 and 2018. Forest areas declined by 1363 km(2) and wetlands declined by 1365 km(2) (69\%). This was most pronounced in the Quebec portion of the A2L where wetland areas declined by 872 km(2) (88.5\%). Forest areas in the Quebec portion experienced the greatest amount of fragmentation with a m(eff\_CUT) decline of 3262.5 km(2) (58.5\%) since 2000. Conclusions Coordinated and collaborative transboundary conservation efforts help improve protection of species with transboundary ranges. Monitoring of land-cover changes and landscape fragmentation is an effective way to identify priority areas for conservation and support transboundary coordination.

LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Potential cougar habitats and dispersal corridors in Eastern North America,"Context Cougars (Puma concolor) have been recolonizing Midwestern North America during the past 3 decades with > 950 cougar confirmations east of established populations. Due to an increase in confirmations east of current breeding populations, evaluation of cougar habitat suitability and connectivity is needed. However, few studies have assessed the habitat potential for cougar recolonization in the eastern portion of their former range. Objectives We used various habitat quality thresholds to model potential cougar habitats and dispersal corridors throughout eastern North America. Methods Based on expert opinion, we used landcover, slope, human density, distance to roads, and distance to water as model variables. Least-cost path methods were used to model dispersal corridors from western populations to potential eastern habitat patches. Results Patches of suitable habitat ranged in size from 3868 km(2) (Ozark Mountains) to > 2,490,850 km(2) (central and eastern Canada). Potential habitats were predominantly forest and shrubland, contained little anthropogenic development, and had high stream densities. Dispersal corridors were present throughout the study area. Corridors largely consisted of forested and cultivated landscapes and had higher road densities than habitat patches. Conclusions Our research provides conservationists with insights into areas suitable for cougar recolonization so they may proactively plan for potential cougar populations east of their current range.

LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,Spatial dynamics of soundscapes and biodiversity in a semi-arid landscape,"Context Semi-arid landscapes are naturally heterogeneous with several factors influencing this variation. Fauna responses and adaptations vary in xeric environments, and the scale of observation is important. Biodiversity monitoring at several scales can be challenging, and acoustics are an alternative to this issue. Objectives We investigated how audible biodiversity is influenced by environmental factors (e.g.: vegetation metrics, climatic variables, etc.) across a fine spatial scale, aiming to provide a better understanding of the variation in audible species across recording locations placed close together. These results will improve the current knowledge on ecoacoustics as a tool for measuring ecological processes in this biome, and better inform conservation plans. Methods We collected data in the semi-arid region in Queensland, Australia placing 24 recorders 200 m apart for 48 h. We also sampled environmental attributes (e.g.: temperature and vegetation structure metrics) and used acoustic indices in a time-series algorithm to categorise sound into classes. Bird species and feeding guilds were also identified. Results We found significant differences between proximate sensors, demonstrating that soundscape differences occur across fine spatial scales. Birds and insects were the predominant biophonic sound observed and both groups were associated with shrub cover and subcanopy height. Environments with higher shrub and subcanopy cover had a higher percentage of all birds' feeding guilds and insects. Sixty-three bird species were identified, including a threatened bird species in Queensland. Conclusion We show biodiversity is influenced by vegetation heterogeneity across fine spatial scales in semi-arid regions, identifying which attributes sustain higher levels of biodiversity activity. Our study reveals the practicality of acoustic surveys for this biodiversity monitoring by covering a large area in 48 h. However, we caution that scale is an important consideration when designing surveys.",Vegetation mosaics; Acoustic indices; Shrub cover; Subcanopy cover; Spatial scale; Biodiversity,2023,38,2,10.1007/s10980-022-01568-9,0921-2973,10,73,283,2030,6,NA,250,6,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,The role of habitat features in patterns of population connectivity of two Mediterranean amphibians in arid landscapes of central Iberia,"Context Mediterranean wetland ecosystems are in continuous decline due to human pressure. Amphibians are key elements of biotic communities of Mediterranean temporary ponds and streams, and their persistence depends on the availability and inter-connectivity of breeding sites. Objectives We investigated the role of different factors potentially driving functional connectivity patterns in two amphibian species at the landscape and local scales. We focused on two Mediterranean endemic pond-breeding amphibians inhabiting semi-arid landscapes of central Spain, the common parsley frog (Pelodytes punctatus) and the common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans). Methods We genotyped 336 individuals of P. punctatus and 318 of A. obstetricans from 17 and 16 breeding populations at 10 and 17 microsatellite loci, respectively. We used remotely sensed vegetation/moisture indices and land use/cover data to derive optimized resistance surfaces and test their association with estimates of gene flow and migration rates across populations. Results We found evidence for higher population connectivity in common midwife toads than in common parsley frogs, with a strong effect of water availability in patterns of population connectivity of both species. However, the two species differ in the role of landscape features on population connectivity, with the distance and spatial distribution of artificial land-use types positively influencing connectivity in A. obstetricans and meadows/pastureland favouring P. punctatus. This is in line with reported breeding site preferences for the two species, with A. obstetricans successfully breeding in artificial water bodies that P. punctatus generally avoid. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of assessing species-habitat relationships shaping connectivity when developing and implementing conservation and management actions to benefit fragmented amphibian populations in the Mediterranean region. Our results show that amphibian species respond differently, even contrastingly to landscape features and thus require alternative, complementary strategies to improve population connectivity and ensure long-term viability.",Conservation; Remote sensing; Landscape resistance; Gene flow; Wetlands; Population genetics,2023,38,1,10.1007/s10980-022-01548-z,0921-2973,20,136,292,2178,6,NA,250,6,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,The interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship in rocky intertidal communities,"A commonly assumed pattern in species assemblages is the abundance-occupancy relationship (AOR), which refers to a relationship between the mean local abundance of each species and the proportion of local sites that each species occupies. The AOR concept is relevant because it allows researchers to make inferences or predictions between species abundance and occupancy, which are key variables in ecology. Although the AOR is thought to be ubiquitous, it has not been found for every system where it has been tested. To date, the studies that have evaluated its generality were largely done in terrestrial systems. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate its occurrence in aquatic systems. This study tests whether the AOR occurs in rocky intertidal systems. Using data for algae and invertebrates from Atlantic Canada, we show that the negative binomial model properly describes the relationship between abundance and occupancy in rocky intertidal communities. Moreover, we found the AOR to hold for two hydrodynamically contrasting habitat types. Overall, these findings expand the applicability of the AOR to marine benthic systems. The raw data are included as part of this article and should be valuable for future syntheses on the AOR, as such studies will benefit from using datasets spanning terrestrial and aquatic systems. In this sense, our abundance data are particularly relevant because they describe density of organisms, which is a condition for AOR modelling that intertidal ecological studies typically do not follow entirely, as the abundance of sessile species is often measured as percent cover.",Benthic; intertidal; invertebrate; seaweed; species composition; wave exposure,2022,18,1-Feb,10.1080/17451000.2022.2105895,1745-1000,8,82,249,1617,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,Redescription of two Phyllodoce (Annelida: Phyllodocidae) species from Hawaii,"The two endemic Hawaiian phyllodocid species Phyllodoce hawaiia (Hartman, 1966) and P. hiatti Hartman, 1966 are only known from the original description. A redescription based upon type material helped clarify the taxonomic status of these species and to confirm the synonym of Prophyllodoce Hartman, 1966 with Phyllodoce Lamarck, 1818. Phyllodoce hawaiia is characterized by having a strongly cordate prostomium, proximal region of proboscis with 20 rows of round papillae and distal region with six longitudinal rows of tubercles, tentacular cirri with short and ringed cirrophores and long cirrostyles and parapodial prechaetal lobes bilobed and asymmetrical.

MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,Recolonization behavior of rapa whelk (Rapana venosa) and common starfish (Asterias rubens) eradicated from mussel bed,"This study aimed to investigate the recolonization behaviour of the rapa whelk (Rapana venosa) and the common starfish (Asterias rubens) on the mussel beds in their natural habitat. The monitoring studies were carried out seasonally on an island covered by a complete mussel bed in the Sea of Marmara (Turkey) between 19 October 2020 and 9 August 2021. Inhabitant rapa whelk and common starfish on the experimental study island (ESI) were tagged, then moved 10 m away from ESI. The recolonization potential of tagged invaders was monitored for 14 days with underwater surveys after their local eradication each season. The percentage of returned rapa whelk to the ESI was higher than common starfish end of the monitoring period. Rapa whelk moved non-stop towards the mussel bed, reaching the ESI at the latest 6th hour. Common starfish reached the mussel bed much later (at the 15(th) hour) than rapa whelk. The common starfish began to leave the ESI at the end of the 7(th) day, while the rapa whelk addicted to the ESI for 14 days. Re-invasion behaviour varied significantly seasonally, and both invaders reached the ESI much later in winter. During the monitoring periods, the highest invader densities were seen in the patches with the most abundant mussels, indicating continued uninterrupted feeding. The re-invasion duration and daily feeding activities support the spread of these invaders and could be considered a threat to marine resources.",Biological invasion; non-indigenous species; prey-predator; feeding behavior; marine invader,2022,18,5-Jun,10.1080/17451000.2022.2120202,1745-1000,16,118,234,1452,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,"Maturity and reproduction in the Arabian carpet shark, Chiloscyllium arabicum from the Saudi Arabian waters of the Arabian Gulf","The Arabian carpet shark, Chiloscyllium arabicum is endemic to the Arabian Gulf and the northern Arabian Sea. The aim of this work is to study the reproduction and maturity of this species. A total of 87 males and 139 females, including 19 egg-bearing individuals collected from bottom set longline fisheries in the Saudi Arabian waters of the Arabian Gulf between October 2017 and February 2019, were examined. The size at 50\% maturity was estimated as 62.3 and 62.5 cm total length (TL) for males and females, respectively. Changes in the gonadosomatic index (GSI) of males indicated the mating to happen between December and February. The maximum follicle diameter, oviducal gland width and GSI in mature females, suggested the ovulation to extend from September to May with the peak during March-May. Females carried 2-4 egg cases in the uteri, and the egg-laying period was between February and May. The segregation of sexes was observed in the larger (70-80 cm TL) size ranges.",Bamboo shark; biology; egg case; elasmobranch; oviparity,2022,18,5-Jun,10.1080/17451000.2022.2131824,1745-1000,19,127,161,984,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,Simulating cyanide fishing: photosynthetic effects of short-term cyanide exposure in three different hermatypic coral species,"Since the 1960s the demand for ornamental aquarium fish has grown steadily and consequently cyanide fishing is still a popular fishing method despite its prohibition. This poses a severe threat to coral reefs in Southeast Asia. This study aimed to investigate the short-term stress reaction on photosynthetic yield in the tissues of three different hard coral colonies (branching growth forms Pocillopora damicornis and Seriatopora hystrix, and massive Porites lobata) to initially high and then decreasing cyanide exposure, mimicking cyanide fishing by fishermen. Experiments were performed both in situ in the coral reefs of the Marine Protected Area Pulau Pieh, West Sumatra, Indonesia, and in the aquaria facilities of ZMT in Germany. A Diving-PAM fluorometer was used for in vivo stress assessment of the holobiont. While in all species the photosynthetic efficiency was significantly reduced right after cyanide application, the massive species displayed much lower Delta F/Fm' values. After three days in cyanide-free water all three coral species recovered to initial values of Fv/Fm, except for P. lobata. No bleaching or discolouration was detected by the conclusion of the experiment after 38 days. Especially Indonesian reefs with massive corals may be therefore more severely impacted by cyanide fishing since the retention time of the water in these reefs is longer than in reefs that consist primarily of branching corals. This might have implications for the management of different reef parts of the MPA.",Indonesia; destructive fishing; MPA; photosynthesis; PAM,2022,18,7-Aug,10.1080/17451000.2022.2147947,1745-1000,15,125,232,1521,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,"Under pressure: Cassiopea andromeda jellyfish exposed to increasing water temperature or lead, cadmium and anthropogenic gadolinium contamination","Similar to other cnidarians such as stony corals, the upside-down jellyfish (Cassiopea spp.) lives in endosymbiosis with dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae. These jellyfish have been described as invasive species and are now found circumtropically in coastal marine environments. This study investigates the response of Cassiopea andromeda and its symbiotic algae to increased water temperature, further elucidating potential impacts of climate change on its populations in tropical ecosystems. It is demonstrated that water temperatures above 34 degrees C are lethal for the C. andromeda medusae tested in this study. A non-lethal temperature rise triggers significant changes in the animals behaviour and physiology, including significant changes in bell pulsation rate and a significant decrease in photochemical efficiency, once 33 degrees C is reached. Additionally, it is demonstrated that C. andromeda is capable of bioconcentrating significant amounts of cadmium from the surrounding water column. In the case of lead exposure, the jellyfish appear capable of regulating intake; no significant bioconcentration has been observed in this study. Our results do not indicate significant differences between the uptake patterns of anthropogenically complexed gadolinium chelates - emerging aquatic pollutants originating from hospital effluents - and the natural, non-chelated rare earth element terbium. This study supports the potential use of Cassiopea jellyfish as an attractive bioindicator species, serving to detect both continuous and pulse-contamination of coastal marine ecosystems. Cassiopea andromeda appears stable up until temperatures of about 34 degrees C, suggesting that temperature increase concomitant with climate change might drive important range extensions of this tropical species into new environments - environments in which the holobiont will play significant roles in local pollutant dynamics.",Temperature stress; bioconcentration; heavy metals; Symbiodiniaceae; pollution,2022,18,1-Feb,10.1080/17451000.2022.2066132,1745-1000,17,145,268,1937,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

The present study aimed to assess the occurrence of juvenile Atlantic goliath grouper in a tropical estuary on the southeastern Brazilian coast. The sample collections were performed from April to November 2015 and from March 2018 to October 2019. A total of 265 juveniles ranging from 5.4-50.5 cm were sampled, from which 148 individuals were tagged using pit tags. Seventeen (11.5\%) of the total tagged individuals were recaptured at least once over time, with two specimens recaptured on two different occasions. Some recaptures occurred in less than a week, while others occurred after six months. The length-weight-relationship of all juveniles resulted in a negative allometric growth pattern.

To identify future changes caused by this activity, we assessed the structure of the megabenthos community in the Perdido Fold Belt (PFB) and its relationships with environmental variables, hydrocarbons, and heavy metals. To achieve this, biological and sediment samples were obtained during the surveys Perdido II (PII) and Perdido III (PIII). 325.75 10(3) ind km(-2) and 582.34 kg AFDW km(-2) were collected, distributed in 110 species. Crustaceans and echinoderms comprised more than 70\% of the total abundance and biomass.

MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,Inferring ecological strategies of Psenopsis spp. (Teleostei: Centrolophidae) inhabiting Indian waters from morphological features,"Morphology of the fish and otoliths are popularly used in the discrimination of species/stocks/populations and also to gather meaningful conclusions about their ecology. This approach is useful to enhance our understanding of the relationship between form and function in fishes when a direct assessment is impossible. Inter-species variation was analysed using geometric morphometric analysis for fish body shape, while morphometry and wavelet functions for sagittae morphology. A clear ecomorphological pattern in the body, as well as otolith shape, is evident among species as deeper inhabiting species possess a deeper body with oblong otoliths compared with shallower species that possess a more streamlined body with fusiform otoliths. We also observed that deeper species (P. obscura) possess bigger eyes for the optimum use of available light and bigger otoliths with higher otolith sensory area and otolith area ratio (S:O) for better sound reception capacities. Our hypothesis supports that the differences in fish morphological as well as sensorial traits (otoliths), which are closely related to their locomotion, foraging pattern and depth of habitation, lead to trophic segregation which in turn encourages their coexistence. This is the first work that discusses the relationship between body shape, otolith morphometry and morphology in deep-sea fishes and their ecomorphological interpretations.",Fish body; otoliths; ecomorphology; Psenopsis; Centrolophidae; Indian waters,2022,18,3-Apr,10.1080/17451000.2022.2101124,1745-1000,14,130,203,1412,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

This study aims to investigate the egg production (number and volume) in P. transversus in a temperate region (Torres, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), comparing between three stages of egg development and four seasons. Ovigerous females were sampled in 2019 at Praia Prainha once per season. In the laboratory, females were identified, measured, and their eggs were classified by stage of development, counted and measured. The main results were: ovigerous females were collected in all seasons, but showed a sharp decrease in winter; fecundity (stage I) was positively correlated with female body size and the highest number of eggs was found in spring and summer; the egg volume was higher in autumn than all other seasons; there was an increase in egg volume during development, while egg loss was only detected in spring.

The sea urchin Sphaerechinus granularis has been commonly tested by exposing its developmental stages to a variety of stressors, but current descriptions about developmental time and morphological features are lacking. This study aimed to describe for the first time the embryonic and larval development of Sphaerechinus granularis with detailed light micrographs and morphological measurements. Adult sea urchins were obtained and spawned to rear embryos and larvae in laboratory conditions at 19 degrees C until competence. Development was monitored by observing individuals in a light microscope and taking microphotographs for description. Embryonic development from fertilization to two-arm pluteus lasted 72 h post fertilization and larvae reached a competent stage 33 days post fertilization. Skeletal post oral rods in larvae from this research lacked lateral spines, which were illustrated by other authors in previous studies. This intraspecific variation should be further studied to understand changes in functional morphology of populations from the same species. Development from fertilization to metamorphosis of S. granularis can be achieved under laboratory conditions in less than 40 days.

MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,grid-net design that successfully reduces discarded catch and damage to benthic species in the veined rapa whelk beam trawl fishery,"In this study, a grid-net design (GND) with three different bar spacings was compared with the commercial beam trawl used in the veined rapa whelk fishery to minimize the discarded catch amount and the loss of commercial product. In addition, the damage and mortality rates of the species that entered the tested fishing gear were determined to understand whether the tested fishing gear has a possible negative effect on benthic species. In the grid-net design, a rectangular metallic grid positioned 6 cm off the ground substituted half of the codend to allow the escape of discard species. Sea trials were carried out in the south-eastern Black Sea between 13 and 24 October 2021. Results showed that the discarded catch amount was significantly reduced by each GND (P < 0.05). Compared with the commercial fishing gear, the reductions in the discarded catch amounts (in terms of number) were 91.6\%, 92.2\%, and 95.0\% for 22, 25, and 28 mm GNDs, respectively. The minimum commercial product loss was determined at 22 mm GND. In addition, it was seen that each GND compared to commercial gear caused statistically significantly less damage and mortality on the discarded species. In conclusion, 22 mm GND was the most successful design among the tested gears in minimizing commercial product loss and reducing the discarded catch amount. Recommendations are given for this design to be adopted by the commercial fleet.",Veined rapa whelk; beam trawl; discard; selectivity grid; damage assessment,2022,18,5-Jun,10.1080/17451000.2022.2123523,1745-1000,20,131,231,1422,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

The diet comprised 63 species (13 taxa). Fish was the most important prey, followed by decapod crustaceans. In 2016, walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) was the dominant fish prey species, while amphipods, decapods and Japanese lanternfish (Notoscopelus japonicus) were prominent in the diet in 2017. Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) were more predominant during 2018-2020. An ontogenetic comparison of diet indicated that smaller individuals (<= 400 mm standard length, SL) preyed mainly on small prey items, such as decapod crustaceans and polychaetes, whereas larger individuals (>400 mm SL) preyed mainly on fish. Moreover, prey size exhibited a significant increasing trend with predator body length. These results suggest that Pacific cod has a flexible feeding strategy that differs by life stage.

These locations are studied in an annual survey to estimate stock size and distribution of northern shrimp. In July 2015, an additional survey was conducted to study the benthic community structure and function to describe the habitat where the northern shrimp fisheries take place. Underwater images were taken from 26 stations, grab samples were collected at 11 stations and in addition, by-catch was collected from the annual Icelandic shrimp survey in August 2015. The sampling sites, despite being distributed throughout a relatively large area north of Iceland, were rather uniform in relation to sediment type and fauna composition. The stations were similar in grain size and dominated by soft sediment of sand and silt/mud and soft sediment fauna. The infauna was mainly burrowing infauna with affinity to soft sediment and surface deposit feeding. The epifauna were free-living crawlers with affinity for predation feeding habit. No relationship with environment was observed for either the epifauna or the infauna. Species diversity and community composition did not vary with depth, probably because of the narrow depth range of the sites.

Hydrocarbons were recorded at lower concentrations than the threshold effects level (TEL) reference values; however, the significant correlation between richness and dibenzothiophene must be evaluated. Beta diversity exhibited a high turnover and functional diversity showed an absence of regional distribution.

Data for the retrospective analysis come from a 20-year sampling (in 2000s) across the Crimean shelf and in adjacent open sea waters. Samples were collected onboard research vessels, in the upper 150 m layer, by Juday nets (vertical hauls) fitted with 145 mu m mesh. These data were compared to field surveys of the 1960s. Seasonal blooms of Noctiluca were pronounced during summer time, with the peak of abundance in June. The mesoscale spatial distribution of Noctiluca abundance was most heterogeneous in June as well. The annual concentration of cells in coastal waters exceeded that of the open sea by four times. The coefficient of Noctiluca seasonal abundance variation in coastal waters was 1.5 times higher than that of the open sea. The Principal Component Analysis implied that the seasonal variation of the Noctiluca abundance offshore was modulated by coupling of the atmospheric precipitation, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, euphotic depth, chlorophyll- a concentration, Noctiluca abundance in coastal waters, mesoscale eddies and wind stress.

MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,Growth and biochemical profiling of marine microalgae Chlorella salina with response to nitrogen starvation,"The present study aimed at investigating nitrogen stress-induced biochemical changes in the marine microalgae Chlorella salina. The algae were grown in N free medium (N-) in order to study the proximate composition via the determination of protein, lipid and carbohydrate. The chemical constituents of this algae were determined using GC-MS and mineral content was analysed using Inductive Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). From the results, the proximate analysis showed increased lipid (34.77 +/- 0.6\%), followed by carbohydrate (26.21 +/- 0.2\%) and protein (5.4\% dry weight). The chemical constituents of C. salina were successively extracted with diethyl ether, hexane, chloroform, acetone and methanol. The extract percentage varied greatly between various solvents, with the highest one (4.68\%) recorded for methanol. A total of 35 compounds were identified from the extracts and the identified chemical groups included ketones, terpenes, fatty acids (FA), fatty alcohols and esters derived fatty acids and/or dicarboxylic acid and hydrocarbons. The methanol extract consisted of FA (35\%), amino acids and N-containing metabolites (7\%), fatty alcohols (8\%), organic acids (3\%) and hydrocarbons (80\%). The algae exhibited high amounts of Mg (54.079 mg/50 g) followed by C (17.341 mg/50 g), S (5.702 mg/50 g) and Na (3.275 mg/50 g). These results demonstrated a strong correlation between the nitrogen content and lipid accumulation, hence showing that Chlorella salina could serve as a potential candidate for biodiesel production.",Carolin Regina Loscher; Microalgae; Chlorella; nitrogen-stress; culture optimization,2022,18,5-Jun,10.1080/17451000.2022.2131823,1745-1000,14,107,224,1554,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH,Catch composition of non-target species escaping dredge gear of Rapana fisheries in the western coast of the Black Sea,"Despite the importance of Rapana fisheries in the Black Sea region, few studies have focused on the non-target species, and determined discard rates from hauls on the deck, with no data on organisms that entered and subsequently escaped the fishing net during the dredge fishing. Rapana venosa is harvested along the entire coast of the Black Sea using dredging or beam-trawl fishing. This study adopted the cover net method to assess the composition and proportion of non-target escapees in Rapana fisheries by dredging along the western coast of the Black Sea. In this method, the dredge net bag (codend net) is covered with a second net bag that has a smaller mesh size to retain those individuals escaping from the dredge net bag. Up to 87\% of the total similar to 1.4x10(6) individuals per km (ind. km(-2)) cover net catches belonged to non-target species. Overall, 24 non-target species were caught in the cover net, with 46\% of species belonging to the Teleostei (mostly flatfishes), 21\% Malacostraca, 17\% Bivalvia, 8\% Gastropoda, 4\% Amphibia, and 4\% Ascidiacea. On the other hand, up to 6.8\% of the total similar to 0.16x10(6) ind. km(-2) catches of the codend net (dredge net) belonged to non-target species. Compared to the cover net, a total of seven non-target species were retained in the codend net, and six of them belonged to Bivalvia. This study demonstrated an apparent negative impact of Rapana fisheries, particularly on escapees that often go unaccounted for their vulnerability to stress and physical damage.",Bivalve; bycatch; discard mortality; dredging; flatfish; Gastropod; Turkiye,2022,18,5-Jun,10.1080/17451000.2022.2126857,1745-1000,19,118,250,1538,7,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Tidal water exchange drives fish and crustacean abundances in salt marshes,"Coastal salt marshes provide important habitat for fishes and crustaceans, including species of commercial value that feed or take refuge in the marsh. Yet population abundances vary considerably between sites, often without clear explanation. We hypothesised that faunal abundance and mean size would be positively related to 2 physical properties that govern marsh accessibility to water-dependent species, as has been found on the southeastern coast of the USA: (1) the volume of water exchanged by tidal flooding, which gives access to the marsh, and (2) edge amount, the length of the water-vegetation borderline per unit area where species can take refuge and feed. Digital terrain models and tidal information were used to select 5 marshes in Wales, UK, that differed in edge amount and water exchange (52 degrees N, 4 degrees W). Fishes and crustaceans were sampled using baited traps, fyke nets and seine nets. In total, 15 species were caught, including commercially valuable brown shrimp, European eel and sea bass. We found water exchange volume, but not edge amount, boosted fish and crustacean abundances. Crab and sea bass sizes were both negatively affected by water exchange, while shrimp and fish sizes were unaffected. Our findings show how the mechanisms that drive fish and crustacean abundances and sizes vary between geographical regions. Feasibly, fisheries associations with marsh hydro-geomorphology might operate differently as well.",Landscape effects; Salt marsh nekton; Pomatoschistus microps; Carcinus maenas; Dicentrachus labrax,2022,694,NA,10.3354/meps14118,0171-8630,11,74,223,1460,5,20,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,"Northward migration, molting locations, and winter residency of California breeding pigeon guillemots Cepphus columba","Pigeon guillemots Cepphus columba are ubiquitous along the coasts of the eastern North Pacific, yet little is known about their winter migration patterns, habitat needs, and potential threats faced during the non-breeding period. We used 3 seasons of year-long light level data from tagged individuals to estimate the migration timing and winter residency of pigeon guillemots breeding on Southeast Farallon Island in California (USA). Light level data were combined with a movement model to estimate positions of tagged animals, revealing that individuals from this population undertook a coordinated coastal migration north in the fall, stopping at sites near Haida Gwaii in British Columbia (Canada), presumably during a flightless prebasic molt, before continuing north to stationary overwintering sites in coastal British Columbia and Southeast Alaska. Birds then made an uninterrupted migration south in the spring, returning to waters around Southeast Farallon in late March and early April. Wet/dry data indicated nocturnal resting on land during the breeding season and likely on the water throughout the non-breeding months. This is the first study to confirm the migratory patterns of pigeon guillemots from California, and highlights the importance of the waters of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska for the studied population and possibly other major populations of this species.",Colonial seabirds; Alcidae; Geolocator; Farallon Islands; Tracking,2022,701,NA,10.3354/meps14194,0171-8630,14,117,206,1396,5,20,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Impacts of marine protected areas and the environment on larval rockfish species richness and assemblage structure in the Southern California Bight,"Although it is well established that marine protected areas (MPAs) are effective tools for augmenting the abundance of fished species, effects on biodiversity and assemblage structure are less clear. Many rockfish (genus Sebastes) species were overfished in the California Current Ecosystem at the turn of the 21st century, leading to establishment of 2 large MPAs in the Southern California Bight, the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs). The CCAs, alongside favorable environmental conditions, helped rebuild overfished rockfish stocks by 2019. Here we assessed the impacts of the CCAs and environment (temperature, oxygen, salinity, chlorophyll a) on rockfish diversity and assemblage structure using a 16 yr time series (1998-2013) of genetically identified rockfish larvae. Larval rockfish richness generally increased across the time series, with the greatest increases inside CCAs when temperature was low and dissolved oxygen was high. We also found a clear species assemblage shift after the implementations of the CCAs, driven largely by rockfishes targeted by fisheries. This shift was most likely initially driven by maturation of a strong 1999 year class, and sustained by protection from fishing and favorable environmental conditions. Our results suggest that the large and long-term MPAs along the southern California coast have induced increases in the diversity of larval rockfish, driven largely by the direct effects of fishing cessation on targeted species.",Sebastes; Cowcod Conservation Areas; Fisheries; Diversity,2022,698,NA,10.3354/meps14161,0171-8630,21,147,216,1475,4,20,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Combining telemetry and fisheries data to quantify species overlap and evaluate bycatch mitigation strategies in an emergent Canadian Arctic fishery,"Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides are bottom-dwelling flatfish that support commercial and community fisheries in Baffin Bay, Canada. Recently, exploratory inshore summer fisheries have raised concerns surrounding the bycatch of Greenland sharks Somniosus microcephalus and Arctic skate Amblyraja hyperborea, which are susceptible to overfishing due to their conservative life history traits. To explore fisheries selectivity and opportunities for bycatch mitigation, we combined pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) and fisheries data to assess habitat overlap and catch trends across these 3 species. PSAT data showed variable inter-specific overlap, with Greenland sharks primarily inhabiting depths <1000 m (725 +/- 193 m), Greenland halibut inhabiting a narrower depth range (1030 +/- 113 m), and Arctic skates overlapping depths (950 +/- 225 m) of both species. However, fisheries data suggested high inter-specific overlap at deepest depths, with peak catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of all species at depths 800-1000 m. A marked decline in Greenland shark CPUE was observed throughout the fishing season which was best explained by cumulative fishing pressure. Combined tagging and fisheries data suggest that targeting specific seasonal habitat will not decrease bycatch, and inshore summer longline fisheries should be evaluated in the context of potentially high elasmobranch mortality, with enforced bycatch handling practices and alternative mitigation measures (e.g. gear modification or reduced soak times) required.",Greenland shark; Somniosus microcephalus; Greenland halibut; Arctic skate; PSAT; Electronic tagging,2022,702,NA,10.3354/meps14212,0171-8630,20,148,211,1543,6,20,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Atlantic inflow is the primary driver of remotely sensed autumn blooms in the Barents Sea,"Arctic shelf seas have historically hosted a single spring bloom, contrasting with temperate seas, where additional smaller autumn blooms occur regularly, caused by storm systems mixing nutrient-rich deep waters towards the surface ocean. Post millennium, autumn blooms have increased in frequency in Arctic shelf seas. Delayed sea-ice formation, stronger autumn winds and greater inflows of nutrient-rich temperate waters have all been suggested to support growing annual net primary production and an increasing incidence of autumn blooms. Here, we investigated data sets of remotely sensed September chlorophyll a, sea surface temperature, current and wind speeds. We explored mechanistic drivers of autumn blooms in the Barents Sea, one of the most productive Arctic shelf seas, to better understand the role of strong winds and the ingression of Atlantic waters in the dynamics of autumn blooms. We performed geographically resolved regressions between remotely sensed September chlorophyll a and environmental conditions in the Barents Sea, demonstrating a strong dependency of autumn bloom intensity on Atlantic inflow. This result highlights the importance of increased study of autumn phytoplankton bloom dynamics on Arctic shelf seas, especially the further collection and dissemination of in situ cell count and nutrient data to determine the significance of autumn blooms for wider ecosystem function.",Phytoplankton; Phenology; Ocean colour; Arctic; Atlantification; Climate change,2022,701,NA,10.3354/meps14201,0171-8630,15,89,204,1413,6,20,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,The importance of shell debris for within-patch heterogeneity and disturbance-recovery dynamics of intertidal macrofauna,"Shell debris increases habitat diversity and ecological heterogeneity, stabilizing sediments and providing substrate for encrusting and epifaunal animals and protection against predation. However, how shell debris influences disturbance-recovery dynamics in different habitats has not been evaluated. We experimentally tested the effects of shell debris on early colonization of macroinvertebrates into defaunated patches across 12 sites along a mud-to-sand gradient. The addition of shell debris enhanced species richness compared to plots without shells and increased variability in the local contributions to beta-diversity, mostly at the muddier sites. The variation in the strength of these effects along the mud gradient highlights the effects of shell debris on community structure and how the muddying of coastal sediments shifts species composition. Loss of shellfish and burying of shells with elevated rates of sedimentation diminishes the role of small-scale sediment heterogeneity for sustaining beta-diversity in low-energy environments.",Macrofauna; Species richness; Recolonization; Beta-diversity; Estuaries; Seafloor,2022,700,NA,10.3354/meps14186,0171-8630,14,120,142,1051,6,20,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,Mesopelagic fishes in a hurry at low latitudes,"We studied mesopelagic fishes in the Red Sea (22 degrees N), hypothesizing that the rapid shifts between day and night at low latitudes would translate into rapid vertical migration speeds and brief near-surface `antipredation windows'. Using a bottom-moored echosounder, we found that diel vertical migration speeds of acoustical scattering layers were up to double that of the global average. Visits to upper water by some of the layers were strikingly brief, around 10 min, and included unusual rapid ascent and descent (up to 22 cm s(-1)), apparently with a high degree of behavioral plasticity. We suggest that the behavior of mesopelagic fishes in upper waters relates to their respective light sensitivities but is controlled by the arrival of predators. Rapid shifts between day and night appear to be an inherent factor in structuring marine ecosystems at low latitudes.",Diel vertical migration; Antipredation window; Migration speed; Scattering layer; Red Sea,2022,694,NA,10.3354/meps14114,0171-8630,8,46,138,879,5,20,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Developing nondestructive species-specific tree allometry with terrestrial laser scanning,"1. Allometric equations predict organism attributes from simple measurements and underlie many global-scale estimates, from plant productivity to ecosystem carbon stocks. In forests, destructive harvesting of trees in common groups (e.g. plant functional type) or at the species level is necessary to develop allometry but, since sampling is extremely difficult, predictions from these equations have high uncertainty due to low sample size, spatial bias and unrepresentative sampling of tree size. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is a promising remote sensing technology that enables efficient and nondestructive estimates of tree-level structure for developing allometric equations. 2. Here, we nondestructively estimated component biomass of three coniferous tree species (Pinus ponderosa, Pinus contorta and Pseudotsuga menziesii) in Colorado, USA using TLS. We evaluated the suitability for this nondestructive data to be supplanted for destructive data in the development of species-specific allometric equations and compared the prediction accuracy against a commonly used national-scale allometry. 3. We found TLS biomass estimates were consistently more precise across species (RMSE = similar to 19\%) than nation-scale allometry (RMSE = similar to 39\%). Nondestructive biomass estimates from TLS are a suitable addition to or replacement for traditional sampling methods, with indistinguishable biomass predictions across most of the tested diameter range. We further show how TLS can be used to develop allometric equations compatible with airborne LiDAR and other remote sensing variables (e.g. height and crown area), developing generalized biomass predictions from crown area and tree height (R-2 = 0.87). 4. The ability for TLS to support the development of nondestructive allometry at a global scale will enable a more nuanced understanding of the drivers of individual tree architecture, while supporting the next generation of biomass remote sensing.",3D; allometry; carbon; LiDAR; metabolic scaling theory; Pinus contorta; Pinus ponderosa; Pseudotsuga menziesii; terrestrial laser scanners,2023,14,1,10.1111/2041-210X.14027,2041-210X,9,89,278,1970,9,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Estimating competition in metacommunities: accounting for biases caused by dispersal,"1. Estimating the strength of interactions among species in natural communities has always been a challenge for empirical ecologists. Sessile organisms, like plants or corals, often occur in metacommunities where they compete only with their immediate neighbours but disperse propagules over a wider area. To estimate the strength of competitive interactions, ecologists often count abundances in cells on a spatial grid for at least two time-points. This data is then analysed using regression, by modelling the change in population size as a function of local densities, using cells as independent data-points: a technique known as space-for-time substitution. These analyses generate estimates of competition coefficients; however, the method ignores dispersal among cells. 2. To determine the impact of ignoring dispersal, we derived the bias that would arise when we apply regression methods to a metacommunity in which a fraction of seeds disperse beyond their natal cells but this dispersal is ignored in the model fitting process. We present results from a range of population models that make different assumptions about the nature of competition and assess the performance of our bias formulae by analysing data from simulated metacommunities. 3. We reveal that: estimates of competition coefficients are biased when dispersal is not properly accounted for; and the resulting bias is often correlated with abundance, with rare species suffering the greatest overestimation. We also provide a standardized metric of competition that allows the bias to be calculated for a broad range of other population models. 4. Our study suggests that regression methods that ignore dispersal produce biased estimates of competition coefficients when using space-for-time substitution. Our analytical bias formula allows empirical ecologists to potentially correct for biases, but it requires either tailored experiments in controlled conditions or an estimate of the average dispersal rate in a natural community, so may be challenging to apply to real datasets.",bias in estimation; conspecific and heterospecific competition; metacommunities; negative density dependence; regression models; simulations; spatially explicit models,2023,14,1,10.1111/2041-210X.14022,2041-210X,10,84,305,2059,7,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,FlywayNet: A hidden semi-Markov model for inferring the structure of migratory bird networks from count data,"Every year, millions of birds migrate between breeding and nonbreeding habitat, but the relative numbers of animals moving between sites are difficult to observe directly. Here we propose FlywayNet, a discrete network model based on observed count data, to determine the most likely migration links between regions using statistical modelling and efficient inference tools. Our approach advances on previous studies by accounting for noisy observations and flexible stopover durations by modelling using interacting hidden semi-Markov Models. In FlywayNet, individual birds sojourn in stopover nodes for a period of time before moving to other nodes with an unknown probability that we aim to estimate. Exact estimation using existing approaches is not possible, so we designed customised versions of the Monte Carlo expectation-maximisation and approximate Bayesian computation algorithms for our model. We compare the efficiency and quality of estimation of these approaches on synthetic data and an applied case study. Our algorithms performed well on benchmark problems, with low absolute error and strong correlation between estimated and known parameters. On a case study using citizen science count data of the Far Eastern Curlew (Numenius madagascariensis), an endangered shorebird from the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the ABC and MCEM algorithms generated contrasting recommendations due to a difference in optimisation criteria and noise in the data. For ABC, we recovered key features of population-level movements predicted by experts despite the challenges of noisy unstructured data. Understanding connectivity places local conservation efforts and threat mitigation in the global context, yet it has proven difficult to rigorously quantify connectivity at the population level.

METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Limits to ecological forecasting: Estimating uncertainty for critical transitions with deep learning,"In the current age of a rapidly changing environment, it is becoming increasingly important to study critical transitions and how to best anticipate them. Critical transitions pose extremely challenging forecasting problems, which necessitate informative uncertainty estimation rather than point forecasts. In this study, we apply some of the most cutting edge deep learning methods for probabilistic time series forecasting to several classic ecological models that examine critical transitions. Our analysis focuses on three different simulated examples of critical transitions: a Hopf bifurcation, a saddle-node bifurcation and a stochastic transition. For each scenario, we compare the forecasts from four deep learning models, long-short term memory networks, gated recurrent unit networks, lock recurrent neural networks and transformers, to forecasts from an ARIMA model and a MCMC estimated model that is given the true transition dynamics. We found that the deep learning models were able to perform comparably to the idealized MCMC model on the stochastic transition case, and generally in between the MCMC and ARIMA models on the Hopf and saddle-node bifurcation examples. Our results establish that deep learning methods warrant further exploration on the challenging class of critical transition forecasting problems.",artificial intelligence; forecasting; machine learning; time series; tipping points,2023,14,3,10.1111/2041-210X.14013,2041-210X,12,100,190,1330,5,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"A Bayesian stable isotope mixing model for coping with multiple isotopes, multiple trophic steps and small sample sizes","We introduce a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model for estimating the relative contributions of different dietary components to the tissues of consumers within food webs. The model is implemented with the probabilistic programming language Stan. The model incorporates isotopes of multiple elements (e.g. C, N, H) for two trophic levels, when the structure of the food web is known. In addition, the model allows inclusion of latent trophic levels (i.e. for which no empirical data are available) intermediate between sources and measured consumers. Running the model in simulations driven by a real dataset from Finnish lakes, we tested the sensitivity of the posterior distributions by altering critical prior parameters and assumptions in the data-generating process. Importantly, we found that the model estimations were particularly sensitive to the assigned prior value for omega (the fraction of H in aquatic consumer tissue that is derived from environmental water rather than diet) so that reliable empirical data for this parameter are required. When reliable information is not available for omega, we suggest that an uninformative prior should be used. The proposed model and inferences are suitable for studies where resources for collecting new data are limited, but useful prior information for each specific trophic level is available from earlier studies.",Bayesian mixing model; informative prior; multiple levels; stable isotope,2022,13,11,10.1111/2041-210X.13989,2041-210X,18,119,207,1373,4,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,A cost-effective method to passively sample communities at the forest canopy-aerosphere interface,"The ecology of the canopy-aerosphere interface within forested ecosystems remains underexplored largely due to the challenges of physically accessing this zone. Sky bridges, towers and other permanent structures are most commonly used to sample the forest canopy-aerosphere interface, but these methods are costly, challenging to replicate, and often alter and degrade the local environment during construction. Thus, there is a clear need for cost-effective and replicable methods for accessing and passively sampling above the forest canopy. We designed and deployed an inexpensive and lightweight telescopic hanger composed of common materials to sample aerial invertebrates above the forest canopy. Deployment involved climbing into tree crowns and securing our hanger design to vertical branches. We sampled the invertebrate community above forest fragments on the campus of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA by suspending blue vane traps from hangers, which were extended to approximately 1 m above the highest terminal bud of the tree, continuously from April through August 2021. We also recorded the microclimate conditions above the canopy at each hanger, including temperature and light intensity. All hangers and traps remained in place and active throughout the study period. In May, we made minor repairs at two locations where the hangers were attached to the trees and, following an intense weather event in July, observed damage to one hanger that did not affect sampling effort. We include cost breakdowns of design components as well as detailed building instructions. This tool offers a durable and inexpensive solution for researchers to access and sample the forest canopy-aerosphere interface that has minimal impacts on the environment and is more easily replicated compared to previous methods.

METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,A general framework for jointly modelling thermal and hydric constraints on developing eggs,"Eggs are a vulnerable stage because they are sensitive to thermal and hydric conditions and yet cannot behaviourally avoid stressful environments. A general mechanistic model of egg development in natural nests requires microclimatic predictions of temperature, humidity, radiation (if above ground) and water potential (if buried in soil) to be integrated with models of heat and water exchange of the egg and the metabolism of the developmental process. Although all the required pieces for such a model now exist, they have not been integrated into a general modelling framework. We developed such an integration using NicheMapR package for mechanistic niche modelling. Specifically, we took an existing general model of egg water exchange and connected it with the microclimate model in NicheMapR to simulate nest thermal and hydric environments, including the effects of soil water potential on liquid and vapour exchange and moisture-mediated soil thermal conductivity on heat exchange. We then used the Dynamic Energy Budget model within the ectotherm model of NicheMapR as the mechanistic engine for the developmental process, allowing the explicit computation of the dynamics of metabolic heat production and all aspects of mass exchange. We illustrate the modelling framework using existing laboratory and field data on reptiles, insects, and birds. We show that it can capture laboratory observations of water exchange and metabolic heat production and how it can be used to map potential development and water uptake under natural conditions at the continental scale. The modelling framework can be used to interpret laboratory experiments and allows strong inferences to be made about the abiotic constraints on egg development in natural nests under past, present, and future environmental change.",biophysical ecology; birds; Dynamic Energy Budget theory; embryonic development; insects; metabolic heat production; NicheMapR; reptiles; water exchange,2022,NA,NA,10.1111/2041-210X.14018,2041-210X,13,91,272,1811,9,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes

One tool that can help both the scientific and applied management communities understand the infection risk during an outbreak is the basic reproductive number, Script capital R0\$\$ \{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{\textbackslash{}mathcal\{R\}\}\}\_0 \$\$. In this paper, we use a network method to calculate and analyse the basic reproductive number, specifically flow network theory. We convert traditional compartmental models to flow networks and then apply the fundamental Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem to calculate the basic reproductive number. We show that this method is equivalent to the traditional next generation matrix method for the calculation of Script capital R0\$\$ \{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{\textbackslash{}mathcal\{R\}\}\}\_0 \$\$, and thus a valid alternative. Then we provide step-by-step instructions and illustrate how to apply this method to epidemic models. The current methods available for calculating Script capital R0\$\$ \{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{\textbackslash{}mathcal\{R\}\}\}\_0 \$\$ are complicated, requiring mathematical training. This can act as a barrier to understanding and cause delays in a real-time response.

METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,A novel red-edge spectral index for retrieving the leaf chlorophyll content,"The leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(leaf)) is a crucial vegetation parameter in carbon cycle modelling and agricultural monitoring at local, regional and global scales. The red-edge spectral region is sensitive to variations in Chl(leaf.) An increasing number of sensors are capable of sampling red-edge bands, providing opportunities to estimate Chl(leaf). However, the contributions of canopy/foliar/soil factors are always combined in the reflectance signal, which limits the generalizability of vegetation index (VI)-based Chl(leaf) inversions. This study aims to propose a new red-edge chlorophyll index to decouple the effects of the canopy and soil background from the Chl(leaf) estimation. The chlorophyll sensitive index (CSI) was proposed, and the regression equations between the CSI and Chl(leaf) were acquired using PROSAIL (PROSPECT + SAIL) and the 4-Scale-PROSPECT model. Sensitivity analyses showed that the CSI is resistant to variations in the canopy structure and soil background. Validation results obtained using 308 ground-measured samples over nine sites world-wide revealed that CSI improves the Chl(leaf) retrieval accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE = 9.39 mu g cm(-2)) compared with the existing Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI; RMSE = 13.00 mu g cm(-2)). Moreover, the CSI method steadily achieves a highly accurate inversion under different LAI and Chl(leaf) conditions.

METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Digitizing the coral reef: Machine learning of underwater spectral images enables dense taxonomic mapping of benthic habitats,"Coral reefs are the most biodiverse marine ecosystems, and host a wide range of taxonomic diversity in a complex spatial community structure. Existing coral reef survey methods struggle to accurately capture the taxonomic detail within the complex spatial structure of benthic communities. We propose a workflow to leverage underwater hyperspectral image transects and two machine learning algorithms to produce dense habitat maps of 1150 m(2) of reefs across the Curacao coastline. Our multi-method workflow labelled all 500+ million pixels with one of 43 classes at taxonomic family, genus or species level for corals, algae, sponges, or to substrate labels such as sediment, turf algae and cyanobacterial mats. With low annotation effort (only 2\% of pixels) and no external data, our workflow enables accurate (Fbeta of 87\%) survey-scale mapping, with unprecedented thematic detail and with fine spatial resolution (2.5 cm/pixel). Our assessments of the composition and configuration of the benthic communities of 23 image transects showed high consistency. Digitizing the reef habitat and community structure enables validation and novel analysis of pattern and scale in coral reef ecology.

MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,A Variety of Fungal Species on the Green Frogs' Skin (Pelophylax esculentus complex) in South Banat,"In the last several decades, amphibian populations have been declining worldwide. Many factors have been linked to global amphibian decline, including habitat destruction, pollution, introduced species, global environmental changes, and emerging infectious diseases. Recent studies of amphibian skin infections were mainly focused on the presence of chytridiomycosis, neglecting other members of the frogs' skin communities. The diversity pattern of fungal dwellers on the skin of green frogs (Pelophylax esculentus complex) was investigated. A total of 100 adults were sampled from three localities in South Banat (northern Serbia) over three consecutive years and detected fungal dwellers were identified using light microscopy and ITS and BenA gene sequencing. Structures belonging to fungi and fungus-like organisms including a variety of spores and different mycelia types were documented in the biofilm formed on amphibian skin, and are classified into 10 groups. In total, 42 fungal isolates were identified to species, section, or genus level. The difference in mycobiota composition between sampling points (localities and green frog taxa) was documented. The highest number of fungal structures and isolates was recorded on the hybrid taxon P. esculentus and locality Stevanove ravnice. Parental species showed a markedly lower diversity than the hybrid taxon and were more similar in diversity patterns and were placed in the same homogenous group. The locality Stevanove ravnice exhibited more pronounced differences in diversity pattern than the other two localities and was placed in a distinct and separate homogenous group. Among the fungal isolates, the highest isolation frequency was documented for Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus sp. sect. Nigri, Epicoccum nigrum, Fusarium proliferatum, and Trichoderma atroviride. Among the documented species, dematiaceous fungi, causative agents of chromomycosis in amphibians, were also recorded in this research with high isolation frequency. Also, some rare fungal species such as Quambalaria cyanescens and Pseudoteniolina globosa are documented for the first time in this research as microbial inhabitants of amphibian skin.",Anura; Frog integument; Mycobiota; Pathogens; Pelophylax esculentus complex,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02135-0,0095-3628,16,99,310,2188,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Environments and Hosts Structure the Bacterial Microbiomes of Fungus-Gardening Ants and their Symbiotic Fungus Gardens,"The fungus gardening-ant system is considered a complex, multi-tiered symbiosis, as it is composed of ants, their fungus, and microorganisms associated with either ants or fungus. We examine the bacterial microbiome of Trachymyrmex septentrionalis and Mycetomoellerius turrifex ants and their symbiotic fungus gardens, using 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing, over a region spanning approximately 350 km (east and central Texas). Typically, microorganisms can be acquired from a parent colony (vertical transmission) or from the environment (horizontal transmission). Because the symbiosis is characterized by co-dispersal of the ants and fungus, elements of both ant and fungus garden microbiome could be characterized by vertical transmission. The goals of this study were to explore how both the ant and fungus garden bacterial microbiome are acquired. The main findings were that different mechanisms appear to explain the structure the microbiomes of ants and their symbiotic fungus gardens. Ant associated microbiomes had a strong host ant signature, which could be indicative of vertical inheritance of the ant associated bacterial microbiome or an unknown mechanism of active uptake or screening. On the other hand, the bacterial microbiome of the fungus garden was more complex in that some bacterial taxa appear to be structured by the ant host species, whereas others by fungal lineage or the environment (geographic region). Thus bacteria in fungus gardens appear to be acquired both horizontally and vertically.",Trachymyrmex; Mycetomoellerius; Microbiome; Fungus-gardening ants,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02138-x,0095-3628,15,118,224,1519,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Environmental and Anthropogenic Factors Shape the Skin Bacterial Communities of a Semi-Arid Amphibian Species,"The amphibian skin microbiome is important in maintaining host health, but is vulnerable to perturbation from changes in biotic and abiotic conditions. Anthropogenic habitat disturbance and emerging infectious diseases are both potential disrupters of the skin microbiome, in addition to being major drivers of amphibian decline globally. We investigated how host environment (hydrology, habitat disturbance), pathogen presence, and host biology (life stage) impact the skin microbiome of wild Dhofar toads (Duttaphrynus dhufarensis) in Oman. We detected ranavirus (but not Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) across all sampling sites, constituting the first report of this pathogen in Oman, with reduced prevalence in disturbed sites. We show that skin microbiome beta diversity is driven by host life stage, water source, and habitat disturbance, but not ranavirus infection. Finally, although trends in bacterial diversity and differential abundance were evident in disturbed versus undisturbed sites, bacterial co-occurrence patterns determined through network analyses revealed high site specificity. Our results therefore provide support for amphibian skin microbiome diversity and taxa abundance being associated with habitat disturbance, with bacterial co-occurrence (and likely broader aspects of microbial community ecology) being largely site specific.",Ranavirus; Amphibian; Skin microbiome; Habitat disturbance; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Toad,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02130-5,0095-3628,14,109,182,1360,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"Long-Read Sequencing Analysis Revealed the Impact of Forest Conversion on Soil Fungal Diversity in Limu Mountain, Hainan","Soil fungi are essential to soil microorganisms that play an important role in the ecosystem's soil carbon cycle and mineral nutrient transformation. Understanding the structural characteristics and diversity of soil fungal communities helps understand the health of forest ecosystems. The transition from tropical rainforest to artificial forest greatly impacts the composition and diversity of fungal communities. Hainan Limushan tropical rainforest National Park has a large area of artificial forests. Ecologists have conducted in-depth studies on the succession of animals and plants to regenerate tropical rainforests. There are few reports on the diversity of soil fungi and its influencing factors in the succession of tropical rainforests in Limu Mountain. In this study, 44 soil samples from five different stands were collected in the tropical rainforest of Limushan, Hainan. High-throughput sequencing of rDNA in its region was used to analyze fungal communities and study their alpha and beta diversity. Analysis of variance and multiple regression models was used to analyze soil variables and fungal functional groups to determine the effects of interaction between fungi and environmental factors. A total of 273,996 reads and 1290 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained, belonging to 418 species, 325 genera, 159 families, eight phyla, 30 classes, and 73 orders. The results showed that the composition of soil fungal communities in the five stands was similar, with ascomycetes accounting for 70.5\% and basidiomycetes accounting for 14.7\%. alpha and beta diversity analysis showed that soil fungi in Limushan tropical rainforest had high abundance and diversity. Multiple regression analysis between soil variables and functional groups showed that organic matter, TN, TP, TK, and AK were excellent predictors for soil fungi. TP was the strongest predictor in all functional groups except soil saprotroph. Organic matter and total nitrogen were the strongest predictors of soil rot. The transformation from tropical rainforest to artificial forest in Limushan did not change the soil fungal community structure, but the richness and diversity of soil fungi changed. The forest transformation did not lead to decreased soil fungal abundance and diversity. Different vegetation types and soil properties affect the diversity of soil fungal communities. We found that Caribbean pine plantations can improve soil fungal diversity, while long-term Eucalyptus spp. plantations may reduce soil fungal diversity.",Soil fungi; Diversity; Tropical rainforest; Limu Mountain plantation; Soil factors,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02129-y,0095-3628,17,120,369,2534,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,An Insight into an Olive Scab on the{''}Istrska Belica{''}Variety: Host-Pathogen Interactions and Phyllosphere Mycobiome,"The olive tree is one of the most important agricultural plants, affected by several pests and diseases that cause a severe decline in health status leading to crop losses. Olive leaf spot disease caused by the fungus Venturia oleaginea can result in complete tree defoliation and consequently lower yield. The aim of the study was to obtain new knowledge related to plant-pathogen interaction, reveal mechanisms of plant defense against the pathogen, and characterize fungal phyllosphere communities on infected and symptomless leaves that could contribute to the development of new plant breeding strategies and identification of novel biocontrol agents. The highly susceptible olive variety ``Istrska Belica{''}' was selected for a detailed evaluation. Microscopy analyses led to the observation of raphides in the mesophyll and parenchyma cells of infected leaves and gave new insight into the complex V. oleaginea pathogenesis. Culturable and total phyllosphere mycobiota, obtained via metabarcoding approach, highlighted Didymella, Aureobasidium, Cladosporium, and Alternaria species as overlapping between infected and symptomless leaves. Only Venturia and Erythrobasidium in infected and Cladosporium in symptomless samples with higher abundance showed statistically significant differences. Based on the ecological role of identified taxa, it can be suggested that Cladosporium species might have potential antagonistic effects on V. oleaginea.",Anatomy; Metabarcoding; Olive scab; Phyllosphere mycobiota; Raphides; Venturia oleaginea,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02131-4,0095-3628,14,120,202,1453,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Multilayer Networks Assisting to Untangle Direct and Indirect Pathogen Transmission in Bats,"The importance of species that connect the different types of interactions is becoming increasingly recognized, and this role may be related to specific attributes of these species. Multilayer networks have two or more layers, which represent different types of interactions, for example, between different parasites and hosts that are nonetheless connected. The understanding of the ecological relationship between bats, ectoparasites, and vector-borne bacteria could shed some light on the complex transmission cycles of these pathogens. In this study, we investigated a multilayer network in Brazil formed by interactions between bat-bacteria, bat-ectoparasite, and ectoparasite-bacteria, and asked how these interactions overlap considering different groups and transmission modes. The multilayer network was composed of 31 nodes (12 bat species, 14 ectoparasite species, and five bacteria genera) and 334 links, distributed over three layers. The multilayer network has low modularity and shows a core-periphery organization, that is, composed of a few generalist species with many interactions and many specialist species participating in few interactions in the multilayer network. The three layers were needed to accurately describe the multilayer structure, while aggregation leads to loss of information. Our findings also demonstrated that the multilayer network is influenced by a specific set of species that can easily be connected to the behavior, life cycle, and type of existing interactions of these species. Four bat species (Artibeus lituratus, A. planirostris, Phyllostomus discolor, and Platyrrhinus lineatus), one ectoparasite species (Steatonyssus) and three bacteria genera (Ehrlichia, hemotropic Mycoplasma and Neorickettsia) are the most important species for the multilayer network structure. Finally, our study brings an ecological perspective under a multilayer network approach on the interactions between bats, ectoparasites, and pathogens. By using a multilayer approach (different types of interactions), it was possible to better understand these different ecological interactions and how they affect each other, advancing our knowledge on the role of bats and ectoparasites as potential pathogen vectors and reservoirs, as well as the modes of transmission of these pathogens.",Bartonella; Chiroptera; Ehrlichia; Hemoplasmas; Neorickettsia; Host-parasite association,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02108-3,0095-3628,12,91,322,2312,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"Red Mangrove Propagule Bacterial Communities Vary With Geographic, But Not Genetic Distance","Bacterial communities associated with plant propagules remain understudied, despite the opportunities that propagules represent as dispersal vectors for bacteria to new sites. These communities may be the product of a combination of environmental influence and inheritance from parent to offspring. The relative role of these mechanisms could have significant implications for our understanding of plant-microbe interactions. We studied the correlates of microbiome community similarities across an invasion front of red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle L.) in Florida, where the species is expanding northward. We collected georeferenced propagule samples from 110 individuals of red mangroves across 11 populations in Florida and used 16S rRNA gene (iTag) sequencing to describe their bacterial communities. We found no core community of bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) across the Florida range of red mangroves, though there were some ASVs shared among individuals within most populations. Populations differed significantly as measured by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, but not Unifrac distance. We generated data from 6 microsatellite loci from 60 individuals across 9 of the 11 populations. Geographic distance was correlated with beta diversity, but genetic distance was not. We conclude that red mangrove propagule bacterial communities are likely influenced more by local environmental acquisition than by inheritance.",Rhizophora mangle; Microsatellites; 16S rRNA; Mangrove; Microbiome; Propagule,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02147-w,0095-3628,12,91,198,1431,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,A Matter of Metals: Copper but Not Cadmium Affects the Microbial Alpha-Diversity of Soils and Sediments - a Meta-analysis,"Heavy metal (HM) accumulation in soil affects plants and soil fauna, yet the effect on microbial alpha-diversity remains unclear, mainly due to the absence of dedicated research synthesis (e.g. meta-analysis). Here, we report the first meta-analysis of the response of soil microbial alpha-diversity to the experimental addition of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu). We considered studies conducted between 2013 and 2022 using DNA metabarcoding of bacterial and fungal communities to overcome limitations of other cultivation- and electrophoresis-based techniques. Fungi were discarded due to the limited study number (i.e. 6 studies). Bacterial studies resulted in 66 independent experiments reported in 32 primary papers from four continents. We found a negative dose-dependent response for Cu but not for Cd for bacterial alpha-diversity in the environments, only for Cu additions exceeding 29.6 mg kg(-1) (first loss of - 0.06\% at 30 mg kg(-1)). The maximal loss of bacterial alpha-diversity registered was 13.89\% at 3837 mg kg(-1). Our results first highlight that bacterial communities behave differently to soil pollution depending on the metal. Secondly, our study suggests that even extreme doses of Cu do not cause a dramatic loss in alpha-diversity, highlighting how the behaviour of bacterial communities diverges from soil macro-organisms.",Bacterial communities; Alpha-diversity; Soil; Sediment; Rhizosphere; Heavy metals; Meta-analysis,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02115-4,0095-3628,19,121,198,1349,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Changes in Bacterial Community Structure Across the Different Life Stages of Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens),"The digestive capacity of organic compounds by the black soldier fly (BSF, Hermetia illucens, Diptera: Stratiomyidae, Linnaeus, 1758) is known to rely on complex larva-microbiota interactions. Although insect development is known to be a driver of changes of bacterial communities, the fluctuations along BSF life cycle in terms of composition and diversity of bacterial communities are still unknown. In this work, we used a metabarcoding approach to explore the differences in bacterial diversity along all four BSF developmental stages: eggs, larvae, pupae, and adult. We detected not only significant differences in bacterial community composition and species richness along the development of BSF, but also nine prevalent amplicon single variants (ASVs) forming the core microbiota. Out of the 2010 ASVs identified, 160 were significantly more abundant in one of the life stages. Moreover, using PICRUSt2, we inferred 27 potential metabolic pathways differentially used among the BSF life cycle. This distribution of metabolic pathways was congruent with the bacterial taxonomic distribution among life stages, demonstrating that the functional requirements of each phase of development are drivers of bacterial composition and diversity. This study provides a better understanding of the different metabolic processes occurring during BSF development and their links to changes in bacterial taxa. This information has important implications for improving bio-waste processing in such an economically important insect species.",Black soldier fly; Bacterial communities; Metabolic pathways; Metabarcoding; Development,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02146-x,0095-3628,16,114,218,1531,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,The Ecological Differentiation of Particle-Attached and Free-Living Bacterial Communities in a Seasonal Flooding Lake-the Poyang Lake,"Particle-attached (PA) and free-living (FL) bacterial communities play essential roles in the biogeochemical cycling of essential nutrients in aquatic environments. However, little is known about the factors that drive the differentiation of bacterial lifestyles, especially in flooding lake systems. Here we assessed the compositional and functional similarities between the FL and PA bacterial fractions in a typical flooding lake-the Poyang Lake (PYL) of China. The results revealed that PA communities had significantly different compositions and functions from FL communities in every hydrological period, and the diversity of both PA and FL communities was affected mainly by the water regime rather than bacterial lifestyles. PA communities were more diverse and enriched with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, while FL communities had more Actinobacteria. There was a higher abundance of photosynthetic and nitrogen-cycling bacterial groups in PA communities, but a higher abundance of members involved in hydrocarbon degradation, aromatic hydrocarbon degradation, and methylotrophy in FL communities. Water properties (e.g., temperature, pH, total phosphorus) significantly regulated the lifestyle variations of PA and FL bacteria in PYL. Collectively, our results have demonstrated a clear ecological differentiation of PA and FL bacterial communities in flooding lakes, suggesting that the connectivity between FL and PA bacterial fractions is water property-related rather than water regime-related.",Bacterioplankton; Particle-attached bacteria; Free-living bacteria; Water regime; Poyang Lake,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02134-1,0095-3628,16,133,206,1511,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Bacterial Skin Assemblages of Sympatric Salamanders Are Primarily Shaped by Host Genus,"Bacterial assemblages on the skins of amphibians are known to influence pathogen resistance and other important physiological functions in the host. Host-specific factors and the environment play significant roles in structuring skin assemblages. This study used high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing and multivariate analyses to examine differences in skin-bacterial assemblages from 246 salamanders belonging to three genera in the lungless family Plethodontidae along multiple spatial gradients. Composition and alpha- and beta-diversity of bacterial assemblages were defined, indicator species were identified for each host group, and the relative influences of host- versus environment-specific ecological factors were evaluated. At the broadest spatial scale, host genus, host species, and sampling site were predictive of skin assemblage structure, but host genus and species were more influential after controlling for the marginal effects of site, as well as nestedness of site. Furthermore, assemblage similarity within each host genus did not change with increasing geographic distance. At the smallest spatial scale, site-specific climate analyses revealed different relationships to climatic variables for each of the three genera, and these relationships were determined by host ecomode. Variation in bacterial assemblages of terrestrial hosts correlated with landscape-level climatic variability, and this pattern decayed with increasing water dependence of the host. Results from this study highlight host-specific considerations for researchers studying wildlife diseases in co-occurring, yet ecologically divergent, species.",Distance decay; Plethodon; Desmognathus; Eurycea; Microbiome,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02127-0,0095-3628,12,86,218,1640,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Obligate Gut Symbiotic Association with Caballeronia in the Mulberry Seed Bug Paradieuches dissimilis (Lygaeoidea: Rhyparochromidae),"Many insects possess symbiotic bacteria in their bodies, and microbial symbionts play pivotal metabolic roles for their hosts. Members of the heteropteran superfamilies Coreoidea and Lygaeoidea stinkbugs harbor symbionts of the genus Caballeronia in their intestinal tracts. Compared with symbiotic associations in Coreoidea, those in Lygaeoidea insects are still less understood. Here, we investigated a symbiotic relationship involving the mulberry seed bug Paradieuches dissimilis (Lygaeoidea: Rhyparochromidae) using histological observations, cultivation of the symbiont, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and infection testing of cultured symbionts. Histological observations and cultivation revealed that P. dissimilis harbors Caballeronia symbionts in the crypts of its posterior midgut. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of field-collected P. dissimilis confirmed that the genus Caballeronia is dominant in the midgut of natural populations of P. dissimilis. In addition, PCR diagnostics showed that the eggs were free of symbiotic bacteria, and hatchlings horizontally acquired the symbionts from ambient soil. Infection and rearing experiments revealed that symbiont-free aposymbiotic individuals had abnormal body color, small body size, and, strikingly, a low survival rate, wherein no individuals reached adulthood, indicating an obligate cooperative mutualism between the mulberry seed bug and Caballeronia symbionts.",Symbiosis; Caballeronia; Stinkbug; Paradieuches dissimilis; Obligate gut symbiosis,2023,86,2,10.1007/s00248-022-02117-2,0095-3628,15,132,189,1433,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,Impact of Sulfoxaflor Exposure on Bacterial Community and Developmental Performance of the Predatory Ladybeetle Propylea japonica,"Insects maintain a vast number of symbiotic bacteria, and these symbionts play key roles in the hosts' life processes. Propylea japonica (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is an abundant and widespread ladybeetle in agricultural fields in Asia. Both larvae and adults of P. japonica are likely to be exposed to insecticide residue in the field during their predatory activity. Sulfoxaflor is a highly powerful insecticide that has strong efficacy in controlling sap-sucking pests. To date, there have been several studies on the acute and long-term toxicity of sulfoxaflor to insects, but few studies have reported the impact of sulfoxaflor on the predators' micro-ecosystems. This study was to determine the impact of sulfoxaflor on the symbiotic bacteria and developmental performance of P. japonica. In the present study, two concentrations (1 mg/L and 5 mg/L) and two exposure periods (1 day and 5 days) were set for P. japonica under sulfoxaflor exposure. The survival rate, developmental duration, pupation rate, emergence rate, and body weight of P. japonica were examined. Moreover, the bacterial community of P. japonica was investigated by high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Our results indicated that bacterial community of P. japonica was mainly composed of Staphylococcus, Pantoea, Acinetobacter, Rhodococcus, and Ralstonia at the genus level. The bacterial community of P. japonica in 1 mg/L and 5 mg/L sulfoxaflor groups was significantly altered on day 1, compared with that in control group. The results also showed that the larval duration was significantly prolonged but the pupal duration was significantly shortened in both sulfoxaflor groups. Meanwhile, the pupation and emergence rate was not significantly changed, but the body weights of adults were significantly decreased in both sulfoxaflor groups.

However, few studies have evaluated field conditions where livestock wastes have been used for extended periods of time. In this study, physicochemical parameters, metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA gene, and ecotoxicity indexes were used for the characterization of chicken manure and poultry litter to examine the effect of their application to agricultural soils for 10 years. Poultry wastes showed high concentrations of nutrients and increased electrical conductivity leading to phytotoxic effects on seeds. The bacterial communities were dominated by typical members of the gastrointestinal tract, noting the presence of pathogenic bacteria. Soils subjected to poultry manure applications showed statistically higher values of total and extractable phosphorous, increasing the risk of eutrophication. Moreover, while the soil bacterial community remained dominated by the ones related to the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients and plant growth promotion, losses of alpha diversity were observed on treated soils.

MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Genomic Analyses Reveal Association of ASIP with a Recurrently evolving Adaptive Color Pattern in Frogs,"Traits shared among distantly related lineages are indicators of common evolutionary constraints, at the ecological, physiological, or molecular level. Here, we show that the vertebral stripe, a cryptic color pattern, has evolved hundreds of times in the evolutionary history of anurans (frogs and toads) and is favored in terrestrial habitats. Using a genome-wide association study, we demonstrate that variation near the Agouti signaling protein gene (ASIP) is responsible for the different vertebral stripe phenotypes in the African grass frog Ptychadena robeensis. RNAseq and real-time quantitative PCR revealed that differential expression of the gene and an adjacent long non-coding RNA is linked to patterning in this species. Surprisingly, and although the stripe phenotypes are shared with closely related species, we found that the P. robeensis alleles are private to the species and unlikely to evolve under long-term balancing selection, thus indicating that the vertebral stripe phenotypes result from parallel evolution within the group. Our findings demonstrate that this cryptic color pattern evolved rapidly and recurrently in terrestrial anurans, and therefore constitutes an ideal system to study repeated evolution.",repeated evolution; adaptation; Agouti signaling protein; color polymorphism; Anura,2022,39,11,10.1093/molbev/msac235,0737-4038,15,103,177,1235,5,NA,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

We investigate this phenomenon in a population of largely Oryza sativa ssp. indica rice landraces under normal unstressed wet and stressful drought field conditions. We include single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion/deletion mutations, and structural variants in our analysis and find a stronger association between rare variants and gene expression outliers under the stress condition. We also show an association of the strength of this rare variant effect with linkage, gene expression levels, network connectivity, local recombination rate, and fitness consequence scores, consistent with the stabilizing selection model of gene expression.",crop; rare variant; gene dysregulation; stabilizing selection,2022,39,9,10.1093/molbev/msac193,0737-4038,11,72,124,910,4,NA,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

However, the relationship between the evolution of UCP1 and fat deposition in the blubber layer in cetaceans remains unclear. Here, frameshift mutations, premature termination, and relaxed selection pressure (omega = 0.9557, P < 0.05) were detected in UCP1 in cetaceans, suggesting that UCP1 was inactivated during cetacean evolution. By time estimation, it was found that the inactivation of UCP1 in cetaceans occurred between 53.1 and 50.2 Ma. However, combined with findings from immunohistochemical analysis of the blubber layer of the Yangtze finless porpoise and in vitro functional assays, a premature termination of cetacean UCP1 resulted in a reduction of UCP1-mediated NST capacity (about 50\%) and lipolytic capacity (about 40\%), both of which were beneficial to maintain blubber layer and body temperature without excessive fat consumption. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the blubber thickening in cetaceans and highlights the importance of UCP1 attenuation in cetaceans for secondary aquatic adaptation.",cetaceans; UCP1; blubber; thermoregulation; pseudogenization,2022,39,11,10.1093/molbev/msac230,0737-4038,15,100,181,1255,5,NA,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,The High Mutational Sensitivity of ccdA Antitoxin Is Linked to Codon Optimality,"Deep mutational scanning studies suggest that synonymous mutations are typically silent and that most exposed, nonactive-site residues are tolerant to mutations. Here, we show that the ccdA antitoxin component of the Escherichia coli ccdAB toxin-antitoxin system is unusually sensitive to mutations when studied in the operonic context. A large fraction (similar to 80\%) of single-codon mutations, including many synonymous mutations in the ccdA gene shows inactive phenotype, but they retain native-like binding affinity towards cognate toxin, CcdB. Therefore, the observed phenotypic effects are largely not due to alterations in protein structure/stability, consistent with a large region of CcdA being intrinsically disordered. E. coli codon preference and strength of ribosome-binding associated with translation of downstream ccdB gene are found to be major contributors of the observed ccdA mutant phenotypes. In select cases, proteomics studies reveal altered ratios of CcdA:CcdB protein levels in vivo, suggesting that the ccdA mutations likely alter relative translation efficiencies of the two genes in the operon. We extend these results by studying single-site synonymous mutations that lead to loss of function phenotypes in the relBE operon upon introduction of rarer codons. Thus, in their operonic context, genes are likely to be more sensitive to both synonymous and nonsynonymous point mutations than inferred previously.",codon preference; saturation mutagenesis; translational efficiency; ribosome pausing; protein and RNA levels,2022,39,10,10.1093/molbev/msac187,0737-4038,12,79,206,1441,5,NA,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,The Genomic Landscapes of Desert Birds Form over Multiple Time Scales,"Spatial models show that genetic differentiation between populations can be explained by factors ranging from geographic distance to environmental resistance across the landscape. However, genomes exhibit a landscape of differentiation, indicating that multiple processes may mediate divergence in different portions of the genome. We tested this idea by comparing alternative geographic predctors of differentiation in ten bird species that co-occur in Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts of North America. Using population-level genomic data, we described the genomic landscapes across species and modeled conditions that represented historical and contemporary mechanisms. The characteristics of genomic landscapes differed across species, influenced by varying levels of population structuring and admixture between deserts, and the best-fit models contrasted between the whole genome and partitions along the genome. Both historical and contemporary mechanisms were important in explaining genetic distance, but particularly past and current environments, suggesting that genomic evolution was modulated by climate and habitat There were also different best-flit models across genomic partitions of the data, indicating that these regions capture different evolutionary histories. These results show that the genomic landscape of differentiation can be associated with alternative geographic factors operating on different portions of the genome, which reflect how heterogeneous patterns of genetic differentiation can evolve across species and genomes.",genomics; isolation by distance; genomic landscapes; isolation by ecology; model selection; divergence,2022,39,10,10.1093/molbev/msac200,0737-4038,11,69,205,1553,6,NA,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Taming the Selection of Optimal Substitution Models in Phylogenomics by Site Subsampling and Upsampling,"The selection of the optimal substitution model of molecular evolution imposes a high computational burden for long sequence alignments in phylogenomics. We discovered that the analysis of multiple tiny subsamples of site patterns from a full sequence alignment recovers the correct optimal substitution model when sites in the subsample are upsampled to match the total number of sites in the full alignment. The computational costs of maximum-likelihood analyses are reduced by orders of magnitude in the subsample-upsample (SU) approach because the upsampled alignment contains only a small fraction of all site patterns. We present an adaptive protocol, ModelTamer, that implements the new SU approach and automatically selects subsamples to estimate optimal models reliably. ModelTamer selects models hundreds to thousands of times faster than the full data analysis while needing megabytes rather than gigabytes of computer memory.",phylogenetics; maximum likelihood; substitution model,2022,39,11,10.1093/molbev/msac236,0737-4038,14,103,136,937,3,NA,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Transcriptome-based Phylogeny of the Semi-aquatic Bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Gerromorpha) Reveals Patterns of Lineage Expansion in a Series of New Adaptive Zones,"Key innovations enable access to new adaptive zones and are often linked to increased species diversification. As such, innovations have attracted much attention, yet their concrete consequences on the subsequent evolutionary trajectory and diversification of the bearing lineages remain unclear. Water striders and relatives (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Gerromorpha) represent a monophyletic lineage of insects that transitioned to live on the water-air interface and that diversified to occupy ponds, puddles, streams, mangroves and even oceans. This lineage offers an excellent model to study the patterns and processes underlying species diversification following the conquest of new adaptive zones. However, such studies require a reliable and comprehensive phylogeny of the infraorder. Based on whole transcriptomic datasets of 97 species and fossil records, we reconstructed a new phylogeny of the Gerromorpha that resolved inconsistencies and uncovered strong support for previously unknown relationships between some important taxa. We then used this phylogeny to reconstruct the ancestral state of a set of adaptations associated with water surface invasion (fluid locomotion, dispersal and transition to saline waters) and sexual dimorphism. Our results uncovered important patterns and dynamics of phenotypic evolution, revealing how the initial event of water surface invasion enabled multiple subsequent transitions to new adaptive zones on the water surfaces. This phylogeny and the associated transcriptomic datasets constitute highly valuable resources, making Gerromorpha an attractive model lineage to study phenotypic evolution.",adaptation; adaptive zone; Gerromorpha; key innovation; phylogeny; semi-aquatic bugs,2022,39,11,10.1093/molbev/msac229,0737-4038,21,164,224,1644,6,NA,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Demographic and Selection Histories of Populations Across the Sahel/Savannah Belt,"The Sahel/Savannah belt harbors diverse populations with different demographic histories and different subsistence patterns. However, populations from this large African region are notably under-represented in genomic research. To investigate the population structure and adaptation history of populations from the Sahel/Savannah space, we generated dense genome-wide genotype data of 327 individuals-comprising 14 ethnolinguistic groups, including 10 previously unsampled populations. Our results highlight fine-scale population structure and complex patterns of admixture, particularly in Fulani groups and Arabic-speaking populations. Among all studied Sahelian populations, only the Rashaayda Arabic-speaking population from eastern Sudan shows a lack of gene flow from African groups, which is consistent with the short history of this population in the African continent. They are recent migrants from Saudi Arabia with evidence of strong genetic isolation during the last few generations and a strong demographic bottleneck. This population also presents a strong selection signal in a genomic region around the CNR1 gene associated with substance dependence and chronic stress. In Western Sahelian populations, signatures of selection were detected in several other genetic regions, including pathways associated with lactase persistence, immune response, and malaria resistance. Taken together, these findings refine our current knowledge of genetic diversity, population structure, migration, admixture and adaptation of human populations in the Sahel/Savannah belt and contribute to our understanding of human history and health.",Africa; population structure; admixture; selection; pastoralists; camel herders; CNR1 gene,2022,39,10,10.1093/molbev/msac209,0737-4038,10,81,217,1640,7,NA,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Environmental filtering and mass effect are two important processes driving lake benthic diatoms: Results of a DNA metabarcoding study in a large lake,"Environmental filtering is often found to dominate assembly rules in diatoms. These microalgae are diverse, especially at subspecies level, and tend to exhibit a niche phylogenetic conservatism. Therefore, other rules, such as competition or mass effects, should be detectable when environmental gradients and dispersal barriers are limited. We used metabarcoding to analyse benthic littoral diatom communities in 153 sites in a large lake (Geneva) exhibiting weak geographical barriers and weak environmental gradients outside river estuaries. We assessed assembly rules using variance partitioning, phylogenetic and source tracking analyses. No phylogenetic over-dispersion of communities, indicative of exclusive competition, was detected. Instead, we found these communities to be phylogenetically over-clustered, indicating environmental filtering, which was even stronger near river estuaries where environmental gradients are stronger. Finally, using a Bayesian method (SourceTracker), we found that rivers flowing into the lake bring communities that settle, especially in sites close to estuaries. Rivers with the highest discharges are primarily responsible for immigration, explaining 27\% of lake composition. Therefore, despite favourable conditions to observe other rules, our results support that diatom communities are prominently assembled by environmental filtering and immigration processes, in particular from rivers. However, this does not exclude that other assembly rules may be at play at a finer spatial, temporal and/or phylogenetic scale.",assembly rules; Bacillariophyta; large lake; metabarcoding; phylogeny; RuBisCo large subunit,2023,32,1,10.1111/mec.16737,0962-1083,23,150,209,1565,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Epigenetics and island-mainland divergence in an insectivorous small mammal,"Geographically isolated populations, specifically island-mainland counterparts, tend to exhibit phenotypic variation in many species. The so-called island syndrome occurs when different environmental pressures lead to insular divergence from mainland populations. This phenomenon can be seen in an island population of Nova Scotia masked shrews (Sorex cinereus), which have developed a specialized feeding habit and digestive enzyme compared to their mainland counterparts. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), can impact phenotypes by altering gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. Here, we used a de novo masked shrew genome assembly and a mammalian methylation array profiling 37 thousand conserved CpGs to investigate morphological and DNA methylation patterns between island and mainland populations. Island shrews were morphologically and epigenetically different than their mainland counterparts, exhibiting a smaller body size. A gene ontology enrichment analyses of differentially methylated CpGs implicated developmental and digestive system related pathways. Based on our shrew epigenetic clock, island shrews might also be aging faster than their mainland counterparts. This study provides novel insight on phenotypic and epigenetic divergence in island-mainland mammal populations and suggests an underlying role of methylation in island-mainland divergence.",DNA methylation; epigenetic clock; genome assembly; island divergence; island syndrome; masked shrew,2023,32,1,10.1111/mec.16735,0962-1083,9,75,185,1405,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Genomic and phenotypic changes associated with alterations of migratory behaviour in a songbird,"The seasonal migration of birds is a fascinating natural wonder. Avian migratory behaviour changes are common and are probably a polygenic process as avian migration is governed by multiple correlated components with a variable genetic basis. However, the genetic and phenotypic changes involving migration changes are poorly studied. Using one annotated near-chromosomal level de novo genome assembly, 50 resequenced genomes, hundreds of morphometric data and species distribution information, we investigated population structure and genomic and phenotypic differences associated with differences in migratory behaviour in a songbird species, Yellow-throated Bunting Emberiza elegans (Aves: Emberizidae). Population genomic analyses reveal extensive gene flow between the southern resident and the northern migratory populations of this species. The hand-wing index is significantly lower in the resident populations than in the migratory populations, indicating reduced flight efficiency of the resident populations. Here, we discuss the possibility that nonmigratory populations may have originated from migratory populations though migration loss. We further infer that the alterations of genes related to energy metabolism, nervous system and circadian rhythm may have played major roles in regulating migration change. Our study sheds light on phenotypic and polygenic changes involving migration change.",Emberiza elegans; gene flow; hand-wing index; migration change; polygenic,2023,32,2,10.1111/mec.16763,0962-1083,13,95,190,1411,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Haptophyte communities along the Kuroshio current reveal their geographical sources and ecological traits,"Haptophytes are one of the most ecologically successful phytoplankton groups in the modern ocean and tend to maintain balanced and stable communities across various environments. However, little is known about the mechanisms that enable community stability and ecological success. To reveal the community characteristics and interactions among haptophytes, we conducted comprehensive observations from the upstream to downstream regions of the Kuroshio Current. Haptophyte abundance and taxonomy were assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and metabarcoding of 18S rRNA sequences, respectively. The haptophyte community structure changed abruptly at sites on the shelf-slope of the East China Sea, indicating the strong influence of shelf waters with high phytoplankton biomass on downstream communities. Correlation network analysis combined with the phylogeny suggested that haptophytes can coexist with their close relatives, possibly owing to their nutritional flexibility, thereby escaping from resource competition. Consistently, some noncalcifying haptophyte genera with high mixotrophic capacities such as Chrysochromulina constituted a major component of the co-occurrence network, whereas coccolithophores such as Emiliania/Gephyrocapsa were rarely observed. Our study findings suggest that noncalcifying haptophytes play crucial roles in community diversity and stability, and in sustaining the food web structure in the Kuroshio ecosystems.",biodiversity; ecological network; Haptophyta; Kuroshio; phytoplankton; quantitative metabarcoding,2023,32,1,10.1111/mec.16734,0962-1083,13,105,191,1467,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,How ancient forest fragmentation and riparian connectivity generate high levels of genetic diversity in a microendemic Malagasy tree,"Understanding landscape changes is central to predicting evolutionary trajectories and defining conservation practices. While human-driven deforestation is intense throughout Madagascar, exceptions in areas such as the Loky-Manambato region (north) raise questions regarding the causes and age of forest fragmentation. The Loky-Manambato region also harbours a rich and endemic flora, whose evolutionary origin remains poorly understood. We assessed the genetic diversity of an endangered microendemic Malagasy olive species (Noronhia spinifolia Hong-Wa) to better understand the vegetation dynamics in the Loky-Manambato region and its influence on past evolutionary processes. We characterized 72 individuals sampled across eight forests through nuclear and mitochondrial restriction-associated DNA sequencing data and chloroplast microsatellites. Combined population and landscape genetics analyses indicate that N. spinifolia diversity is largely explained by the current forest cover, highlighting a long-standing habitat mosaic in the region. This sustains a major and long-term role of riparian corridors in maintaining connectivity across these antique mosaic habitats, calling for the study of organismal interactions that promote gene flow.",connectivity; cpSSR; gene flow; habitat loss and fragmentation; habitat mosaic; landscape genetics; Madagascar; Malagasy olive; mitochondrial DNA; RADseq,2023,32,2,10.1111/mec.16759,0962-1083,18,132,162,1250,10,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Insights into the potential for mutualistic and harmful host-microbe interactions affecting brown alga freshwater acclimation,"Microbes can modify their hosts' stress tolerance, thus potentially enhancing their ecological range. An example of such interactions is Ectocarpus subulatus, one of the few freshwater-tolerant brown algae. This tolerance is partially due to its (un)cultivated microbiome. We investigated this phenomenon by modifying the microbiome of laboratory-grown E. subulatus using mild antibiotic treatments, which affected its ability to grow in low salinity. Low salinity acclimation of these algal-bacterial associations was then compared. Salinity significantly impacted bacterial and viral gene expression, albeit in different ways across algal-bacterial communities. In contrast, gene expression of the host and metabolite profiles were affected almost exclusively in the freshwater-intolerant algal-bacterial communities. We found no evidence of bacterial protein production that would directly improve algal stress tolerance. However, vitamin K synthesis is one possible bacterial service missing specifically in freshwater-intolerant cultures in low salinity. In this condition, we also observed a relative increase in bacterial transcriptomic activity and the induction of microbial genes involved in the biosynthesis of the autoinducer AI-1, a quorum-sensing regulator. This could have resulted in dysbiosis by causing a shift in bacterial behaviour in the intolerant algal-bacterial community. Together, these results provide two promising hypotheses to be examined by future targeted experiments. Although they apply only to the specific study system, they offer an example of how bacteria may impact their host's stress response.",brown algae; holobiont; host-microbiome interaction; low salinity acclimation; metabolic networks; metabolite profiling; meta-transcriptomics; virome,2023,32,3,10.1111/mec.16766,0962-1083,15,125,222,1634,8,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Migratory behaviour is positively associated with genetic diversity in butterflies,"Migration is typically associated with risk and uncertainty at the population level, but little is known about its cost-benefit trade-offs at the species level. Migratory insects in particular often exhibit strong demographic fluctuations due to local bottlenecks and outbreaks. Here, we use genomic data to investigate levels of heterozygosity and long-term population size dynamics in migratory insects, as an alternative to classical local and short-term approaches such as regional field monitoring. We analyse whole-genome sequences from 97 Lepidoptera species and show that individuals of migratory species have significantly higher levels of genome-wide heterozygosity, a proxy for effective population size, than do nonmigratory species. Also, we contribute whole-genome data for one of the most emblematic insect migratory species, the painted lady butterfly (Vanessa cardui), sampled across its worldwide distributional range. This species exhibits one of the highest levels of genomic heterozygosity described in Lepidoptera (2.95 +/- 0.15\%). Coalescent modelling (PSMC) shows historical demographic stability in V. cardui, and high effective population size estimates of 2-20 million individuals 10,000 years ago. The study reveals that the high risks associated with migration and local environmental fluctuations do not seem to decrease overall genetic diversity and demographic stability in migratory Lepidoptera. We propose a ``compensatory{''} demographic model for migratory r-strategist organisms in which local bottlenecks are counterbalanced by reproductive success elsewhere within their typically large distributional ranges. Our findings highlight that the boundaries of populations are substantially different for sedentary and migratory insects, and that, in the latter, local and even regional field monitoring results may not reflect whole population dynamics.

MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"Molecular phenotyping uncovers differences in basic housekeeping functions among closely related species of hares (Lepus spp., Lagomorpha: Leporidae)","Speciation is a fundamental evolutionary process, which results in genetic differentiation of populations and manifests as discrete morphological, physiological and behavioural differences. Each species has travelled its own evolutionary trajectory, influenced by random drift and driven by various types of natural selection, making the association of genetic differences between the species with the phenotypic differences extremely complex to dissect. In the present study, we have used an in vitro model to analyse in depth the genetic and gene regulation differences between fibroblasts of two closely related mammals, the arctic/subarctic mountain hare (Lepus timidus Linnaeus) and the temperate steppe-climate adapted brown hare (Lepus europaeus Pallas). We discovered the existence of a species-specific expression pattern of 1623 genes, manifesting in differences in cell growth, cell cycle control, respiration, and metabolism. Interspecific differences in the housekeeping functions of fibroblast cells suggest that speciation acts on fundamental cellular processes, even in these two interfertile species.

Although DNA barcoding methods are commonly used for plant identification, these are limited by the low amplification success and low discriminative power of selected genomic regions. In this study, we developed a k-mer-based approach, the DNA signature sequence (DSS), to accurately identify plant taxon-specific markers, especially at the species level. DSS is a constant-length nucleotide sequence capable of identifying a taxon and distinguishing it from other taxa. In this study, we performed the first large-scale study of DSS markers in plants. DSS candidates of 3899 angiosperm plant species were calculated based on a chloroplast data set with 4356 assemblies. Using Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons and high-throughput sequencing, DSSs were validated in four and 165 species, respectively. Based on this, the universality of the DSSs was over 79.38\%.

MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,Analysis of trapped mosquito excreta as a noninvasive method to reveal biodiversity and arbovirus circulation,"Emerging and endemic mosquito-borne viruses can be difficult to detect and monitor because they often cause asymptomatic infections in human or vertebrate animals or cause nonspecific febrile illness with a short recovery waiting period. Some of these pathogens circulate into complex cryptic cycles involving several animal species as reservoir or amplifying hosts. Detection of cases in vertebrate hosts can be complemented by entomological surveillance, but this method is not adapted to low infection rates in mosquito populations that typically occur in low or nonendemic areas. We identified West Nile virus circulation in Camargue, a wetland area in South of France, using a cost-effective xenomonitoring method based on the molecular detection of virus in excreta from trapped mosquitoes. We also succeeded at identifying the mosquito species community on several sampling sites, together with the vertebrate hosts on which they fed prior to being captured using amplicon-based metabarcoding on mosquito excreta without processing any mosquitoes. Mosquito excreta-based virus surveillance can complement standard surveillance methods because it is cost-effective and does not require personnel with a strong background in entomology.

Recent studies have detailed the sequencing of DNA extracted from shells up to thousands of years old and from various taphonomic and preservational contexts. However, previous approaches have largely addressed methodological rather than evolutionary research questions. Here, we report the generation of DNA sequence data from mollusc shells using such techniques, applied to Haliotis virginea Gmelin, 1791, a New Zealand abalone, in which morphological variation has led to the recognition of several forms and subspecies. We successfully recovered near-complete mitogenomes from 22 specimens including 12 dry-preserved shells up to 60 years old. We used a combination of palaeogenetic techniques that have not previously been applied to shell, including DNA extraction optimized for ultra-short fragments and hybridization-capture of single-stranded DNA libraries. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three major, well-supported clades comprising samples from: (1) The Three Kings Islands; (2) the Auckland, Chatham and Antipodes Islands; and (3) mainland New Zealand and Campbell Island. This phylogeographic structure does not correspond to the currently recognized forms. Critically, our nonreliance on freshly collected or ethanol-preserved samples enabled inclusion of topotypes of all recognized subspecies as well as additional difficult-to-sample populations.

MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,Average weighted nucleotide diversity is more precise than pixy in estimating the true value of pi from sequence sets containing missing data,"Nucleotide diversity remains an important statistic in population genetic/genomic studies. Although recent advances in massive sequencing make generating sequence data sets cheaper and faster, currently used technologies often introduce substantial amounts of missing nucleotides in their output. A novel method of estimating pi from data sets containing missing data - pixy - has also recently been proposed. In this study, the pixy estimator, pi(pixy), was compared to average weighted nucleotide diversity, pi(W). The estimators were tested both on sequences simulated in fastsimcoal and real sequence sets. Both sets were modified by random insertion of missing nucleotides. Weighted nucleotide diversity performed better in all pairwise comparisons. It was characterized by a smaller error and a narrower distribution of the results. pi(pixy) tends to overestimate the nucleotide diversity when both the proportion of missing data and the level of variation is low. Of the two estimators, only pi(W) estimated the true nucleotide diversity in a part of the simulations. A simple formula for estimating pi(W) allows for easy integration of the estimator in packages such as pixy, which would allow obtaining more precise estimates of nucleotide diversity either in a sliding window or for discrete genomic regions.",bioinfomatics/phyloinfomatics; genetic variation; missing data; next-generation sequencing; nucleotide diversity; statistics,2023,23,2,10.1111/1755-0998.13707,1755-098X,22,141,195,1318,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,Comparative analysis of fish environmental DNA reveals higher sensitivity achieved through targeted sequence-based metabarcoding,"Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based methods of species detection are enabling various applications in ecology and conservation including large-scale biomonitoring efforts. qPCR is widely used as the standard approach for species-specific detection, often targeting a fish species of interest from aquatic eDNA. However, DNA metabarcoding has the potential to displace qPCR in certain eDNA applications. In this study, we compare the sensitivity of the latest Illumina NovaSeq 6000 NGS platform to qPCR TaqMan assays by measuring limits of detection and by analysing eDNA from water samples collected from Churchill River and Lake Melville, NL, Canada. Species-specific, targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) assays had significantly higher sensitivity than qPCR, with limits of detection 14- to 29-fold lower.

MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,Comparison of destructive and nondestructive DNA extraction methods for the metabarcoding of arthropod bulk samples,"DNA metabarcoding is routinely used for biodiversity assessment, in particular targeting highly diverse groups for which limited taxonomic expertise is available. Various protocols are currently in use, although standardization is key to its application in large-scale monitoring. DNA metabarcoding of arthropod bulk samples can be conducted either destructively from sample tissue, or nondestructively from sample fixative or lysis buffer. Nondestructive methods are highly desirable for the preservation of sample integrity but have yet to be experimentally evaluated in detail. Here, we compare diversity estimates from 14 size-sorted Malaise trap samples processed consecutively with three nondestructive approaches (one using fixative ethanol and two using lysis buffers) and one destructive approach (using homogenized tissue). Extraction from commercial lysis buffer yielded comparable species richness and high overlap in species composition to the ground tissue extracts. A significantly divergent community was detected from preservative ethanol-based DNA extraction. No consistent trend in species richness was found with increasing incubation time in lysis buffer. These results indicate that nondestructive DNA extraction from incubation in lysis buffer could provide a comparable alternative to destructive approaches with the added advantage of preserving the specimens for postmetabarcoding taxonomic work but at a higher cost per sample.",arthropods; biodiversity assessment; DNA extraction; environmental DNA; insects; metabarcoding,2023,23,1,10.1111/1755-0998.13694,1755-098X,15,115,197,1454,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,Development of DNA methylation-based epigenetic age predictors in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda),"Biological ageing is connected to life history variation across ecological scales and informs a basic understanding of age-related declines in organismal function. Altered DNA methylation dynamics are a conserved aspect of biological ageing and have recently been modelled to predict chronological age among vertebrate species. In addition to their utility in estimating individual age, differences between chronological and predicted ages arise due to acceleration or deceleration of epigenetic ageing, and these discrepancies are linked to disease risk and multiple life history traits. Although evidence suggests that patterns of DNA methylation can describe ageing in plants, predictions with epigenetic clocks have yet to be performed. Here, we resolve the DNA methylome across CpG, CHG, and CHH-methylation contexts in the loblolly pine tree (Pinus taeda) and construct epigenetic clocks capable of predicting ages in this species within 6\% of its maximum lifespan. Although patterns of CHH-methylation showed little association with age, both CpG and CHG-methylation contexts were strongly associated with ageing, largely becoming hypomethylated with age. Among age-associated loci were those in close proximity to malate dehydrogenase, NADH dehydrogenase, and 18S and 26S ribosomal RNA genes. This study reports one of the first epigenetic clocks in plants and demonstrates the universality of age-associated DNA methylation dynamics which can inform conservation and management practices, as well as our ecological and evolutionary understanding of biological ageing in plants.",biological age; chronological age; DNA methylation; epigenetic clock; Pinus taeda,2023,23,1,10.1111/1755-0998.13698,1755-098X,12,93,224,1587,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,Forecasting trait responses in novel environments to aid seed provenancing under climate change,"Revegetation projects face the major challenge of sourcing optimal plant material. This is often done with limited information about plant performance and increasingly requires factoring resilience to climate change. Functional traits can be used as quantitative indices of plant performance and guide seed provenancing, but trait values expected under novel conditions are often unknown. To support climate-resilient provenancing efforts, we develop a trait prediction model that integrates the effect of genetic variation with fine-scale temperature variation. We train our model on multiple field plantings of Arabidopsis thaliana and predict two relevant fitness traits-days-to-bolting and fecundity-across the species' European range. Prediction accuracy was high for days-to-bolting and moderate for fecundity, with the majority of trait variation explained by temperature differences between plantings. Projection under future climate predicted a decline in fecundity, although this response was heterogeneous across the range. In response, we identified novel genotypes that could be introduced to genetically offset the fitness decay. Our study highlights the value of predictive models to aid seed provenancing and improve the success of revegetation projects.",Arabidopsis thaliana; genetic variation; genomic prediction; restoration; revegetation,2023,23,3,10.1111/1755-0998.13728,1755-098X,13,95,173,1270,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,FreshOmics: A manually curated and standardized -omics database for investigating freshwater microbiomes,"Freshwater is a critical resource for human survival but severely threatened by anthropogenic activities and climate change. These changes strongly impact the abundance and diversity of the microbial communities which are key players in the functioning of these aquatic ecosystems. Although widely documented since the emergence of high-throughput sequencing approaches, the information on these natural microbial communities is scattered among thousands of publications and it is therefore difficult to investigate the temporal dynamics and the spatial distribution of microbial taxa within or across ecosystems. To fill this gap and in the FAIR principles context we built a manually curated and standardized microbial freshwater -omics database (FreshOmics). Based on recognized ontologies (ENVO, MIMICS, GO, ISO), FreshOmics describes 29 different types of freshwater ecosystems and uses standardized attributes to depict biological samples, sequencing protocols and article attributes for more than 2487 geographical locations across 71 countries around the world. The database contains 24,808 sequence identifiers (i.e., Run\_Id / Exp\_ID, mainly from SRA/DDBJ SRA/ENA, GSA and MG-RAST repositories) covering all sequence-based -omics approaches used to investigate bacteria, archaea, microbial eukaryotes, and viruses. Therefore, FreshOmics allows accurate and comprehensive analyses of microbial communities to answer questions related to their roles in freshwater ecosystems functioning and resilience, especially through meta-analysis studies. This collection also highlights different sort of errors in published works (e.g., wrong coordinates, sample type, material, spelling).",database; freshwater; microorganisms; -omics data,2023,23,1,10.1111/1755-0998.13692,1755-098X,12,104,224,1689,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Taxon sampling includes 30 species in 19 genera representing 13 families. Ancestral state reconstruction shows that most sea pen mitochondrial genomes have the ancestral gene order, and that Pennatulacea with diverse gene orders are found in a single clade. The monophyly of Pennatulidae and Protoptilidae are rejected by both the mitochondrial and nuclear dataset, while the mitochondrial dataset further rejects monophyly of Virgulariidae, and the nuclear dataset rejects monophyly of Kophobelemnidae. We show discordance between nuclear ribosomal gene cluster phylogenies and whole mitochondrial genome phylogenies and highlight key Pennatulacea taxa that could be included in cnidarian genome-wide studies to better resolve the sea pen tree of life.

MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,"Genomic analysis reveals strong population structure in the Giant Sydney Crayfish (Euastacus spinifer (Heller, 1865))","Australia is home to over 140 species of freshwater crayfish (Decapoda: Parastacidae), representing a centre of diversity for this group in the Southern Hemisphere. Species delimitation in freshwater crayfish is difficult because many species show significant variation in colouration and morphology. This is particularly evident in the genus Euastacus, which exhibits large variations in colour and spination throughout its putative range. To understand this variation, we investigated the genetic diversity, population structure, phylogeny, and evolutionary timescale of the Giant Sydney Crayfish (Euastacus spinifer (Heller, 1865)). Our data set is sampled from over 70 individuals from across the similar to 600 km range of the species, and includes a combination of two mitochondrial markers and more than 7000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the nuclear genome. Data were also obtained for representatives of the close relative, Euastacus vesper McCormack and Ahyong, 2017. Genomic SNP analyses revealed strong population structure, with multiple distinct populations showing little evidence of gene flow or migration. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial data revealed similar structure between populations. Taken together, our analyses suggest that E. spinifer, as currently understood, represents a species complex, of which E. vesper is a member. Molecular clock estimates place the divergences within this group during the Pleistocene. The isolated and highly fragmented populations identified in our analyses probably represent relict populations of a previously widespread ancestral species. Periodic flooding events during the Pleistocene are likely to have facilitated the movement of these otherwise restricted freshwater crayfish within and between drainage basins, including the Murray-Darling and South East Coast Drainages. We present evidence supporting the recognition of populations in the southern parts of the range of E. spinifer as one or two separate species, which would raise the number of species within the E. spinifer complex to at least three. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that many freshwater crayfish exhibit highly fragmented, rangerestricted distributions. In combination with the life-history traits of these species, the restricted distributions exacerbate the threats already placed on freshwater crayfish, which are among the five most endangered animal groups globally.",Crustacean; Population genomics; Phylogenetics; Molecular dock; Pleistocene,2023,178,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107629,1055-7903,15,117,343,2445,5,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,Historical biogeography and diversification of ringless Amanita (section Vaginatae) support an African origin and suggest niche conservatism in the Americas,"Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) sustain nutrient recycling in most terrestrial ecosystems, yet we know little about what major biogeographical events gave rise to present-day diversity and distribution patterns. Given the strict relationship between some ECM lineages and their hosts, geographically well-sampled phylogenies are central to understanding major evolutionary processes of fungal biodiversity patterns. Here, we focus on Amanita sect. Vaginatae to address global diversity and distribution patterns. Ancestral-state-reconstruction based on a 4-gene timetree with over 200 species supports an African origin between the late Paleocene and the early Eocene (ca. 56 Ma). Major biogeographic ``out-of-Africa{''} events include multiple dispersal events to Southeast Asia (ca. 45-21 Ma), Madagascar (ca. 18 Ma), and the current Amazonian basin (ca. 45-36 Ma), the last two likely transoceanic. Later events originating in Southeast Asia involve Nearctic dispersal to North America (ca. 20-5 Ma), Oceania (Australia and New Zealand; ca. 15 Ma), and Europe (ca. 10-5 Ma). Subsequent dispersals were also inferred from Southeast Asia to East Asia (ca. 4 Ma); from North America to East Asia (ca. 11-8 Ma), Southeast Asia (ca. 19-2 Ma), Northern Andes (ca. 15 Ma), and Europe (ca. 15-2 Ma), respectively; and from the Amazon to the Caribbean region (ca. 25-20 Ma). Finally, we detected a significant increase in the net diversification rates in the branch leading to most northern temperate species in addition to higher state-dependent diversification rates in temperate lineages, consistent with previous findings. These results suggest that species of sect. Vaginatae likely have higher dispersal ability and higher adaptability to new environments, in particular compared to those of its sister clade, sect. Caesareae. Overall, the much wider distribution of A. sect. Vaginatae, from pan-tropical to pan-arctic, provides a unique window to understanding niche conservatism across a species-rich clade of ECM fungi.",African origin; Amanita; Macroevolution; Global dispersal; Tropical and temperate; Relaxed molecular clock dating,2023,178,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107644,1055-7903,20,156,292,2018,6,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,Phylogenetic relationships and the origin of New World soles (Teleostei: Pleuronectiformes: Achiridae): The role of estuarine habitats,"Even though the monophyletic status of Achiridae has been supported by morphological and molecular data, the interrelationships within the representatives of this family are poorly resolved. In the present study, we carried out the most complete molecular phylogenetic analysis of this group, encompassing all genera and employing both nuclear (Rhodopsin, Recombination activator {[}Rag 1], Mixed - lineage Leukemia [}MLL] and Early Growth Response Protein 3 {[}EGR3]) and mitochondrial (Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit I {[}COI], Cytochrome B {[}CytB], ATPase 6.8, 16S and 12S RNAr) genes. All topologies based on Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian inferences and Bayesian Inference of the Multispecies Coalescent confirmed the monophyletism of Achiridae, in spite of some incongruences in relation to Achirus mucuri, A. lineatus, Apionichthys finis and Trinectes microphthalmus. In fact, Achirus and Trinectes proved to be non-monophyletic genera while Hypoclinemus mentalis was closely related to A. achirus, suggesting this species should be reevaluated. We provided evidence that Achiridae has first arisen in estuaries (about 23.5 million years ago) and some lineages have evolved independently to either marine or freshwater habitats. Furthermore, we propose a diversification scenario of New World soles involving at least two events of marine incursions during Miocene and Pliocene - Pleistocene associated with natural geographic barriers (Victoria-Trindade chain), the width and exposure of continental shelf and headwater capture along the Amazon basin. Finally, the evolutionary dependence of Achirid soles on estuaries, characterized as highly dy-namic environments, has probably driven the recent divergence of many species of Achiridae.",Achiridae; Molecular phylogeny; Evolution; Flatfish,2023,178,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107631,1055-7903,17,134,243,1743,4,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,"Phylogeny, character evolution, and biogeography of the fern genus Bolbitis (Dryopteridaceae)","Bolbitis is a pantropical fern genus of Dryopteridaceae with ca. 80 species mainly in tropical Asia. Earlier studies confirmed the monophyly of Bolbitis when Mickelia is excluded and identified three major clades in Bolbitis. However, earlier studies are based on relatively small sampling and the majority of Asian species are not sampled. In this study, DNA sequences of three plastid markers of 169 accessions representing ca. 68 (85 \% of total) species of Bolbitis in nine out of the 10 series recognized by Hennipman (1977), and 54 accessions representing the five remaining bolbitidoid genera are used to infer a global phylogeny with a focus on Asian species. The major results include: (1) Bolbitis is strongly supported as monophyletic; (2) species of Bolbitis are resolved into four major clades and their relationships are: the Malagasy/Mascarene clade is sister to the rest, followed by the African clade which is sister to the American clade + the Asian clade; (3) six well-supported subclades are identified in the most speciose Asian clade; (4) the free-veined Egenolfia is embedded in Bolbitis and is paraphyletic in relation to species with anastomosing venation; (5) three series sensu Hennipman (1977), B. ser. Alienae, B. ser. Egenolfianae, and B. ser. Heteroclitae, are paraphyletic or polyphyletic; (6) evolution of six morphological characters is analyzed and free venation is found to have evolved from anastomosing venation and reversed to free venation in Bolbitis; and (7) biogeographical implications are drawn and it is shown that a single recent dispersal from Asia resulted in continental disjunction of closely related ferns of Bolbitis between Africa and America.",African origin of ferns; Biogeographical stepping stone; Egenolfia; Fern phylogeny; Pantropical distribution; Venation patterns,2023,178,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107633,1055-7903,11,93,263,1697,6,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,Phylogeography and taxonomy of Coleonyx elegans Gray 1845 (Squamata: Eublepharidae) in Mesoamerica: The Isthmus of Tehuantepec as an environmental barrier,"Population divergence leading to speciation is often explained by physical barriers causing allopatric distributions of historically connected populations. Environmental barriers have increasingly been shown to cause population divergence through local adaptation to distinct ecological characteristics. In this study, we evaluate population structuring and phylogeographic history within the Yucat ` an banded gecko Coleonyx elegans Gray 1845 to assess the role of both physical and environmental barriers in shaping the spatio-genetic distribution of a Mesoamerican tropical forest taxon. We generated RADseq and multi-locus Sanger datasets that included sampling across the entire species' range. Results find support for two distinct evolutionary lineages that diverged during the late Pliocene and show recent population expansions. Furthermore, these genetic lineages largely align with subspecies boundaries defined by morphology. Several mountain ranges identified as phylogeographic barriers in other taxa act as physical barriers to gene flow between the two clades. Despite the absence of a physical barrier between lineages across the lowland Isthmus of Tehuantepec, no introgression was observed. Here, a steep environmental cline associated with seasonality of precipitation corresponds exactly with the distributional limits of the lineages, whose closest samples are only 30 km apart. The combination of molecular and environmental evidence, and in conjunction with previous morphological evidence, allows us to reassess the current taxonomy in an integrative framework. Based on our findings, we elevate the previously recognized subspecies from the Pacific versant, the Colima banded gecko C. nemoralis Klauber 1945, to full species status and comment on conservation implications.",Phylogeography; Population structure; RADseq; Sanger; Banded Geckos; Isthmus of Tehuantepec,2023,178,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107632,1055-7903,20,154,246,1799,6,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,"Phylogeography, hybridization, and species discovery in the Etheostoma nigrum complex (Percidae: Etheostoma: Boleosoma)","The history of riverine fish diversification is largely a product of geographic isolation. Physical barriers that reduce or eliminate gene flow between populations facilitate divergence via genetic drift and natural selection, eventually leading to speciation. For freshwater organisms, diversification is often the product of drainage basin rearrangements. In young clades where the history of isolation is the most recent, evolutionary relationships can resemble a tangled web. One especially recalcitrant group of freshwater fishes is the Johnny Darter (Etheostoma nigrum) species complex, where traditional taxonomy and molecular phylogenetics indicate a history of gene flow and conflicting inferences of species diversity. Here we assemble a genomic dataset using double digest restriction site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing and use phylogenomic and population genetic approaches to investigate the evolutionary history of the complex of species that includes E. nigrum, E. olmstedi, E. perlongum, and E. susanae. We reveal and validate several evolutionary lineages that we delimit as species, highlighting the need for additional work to formally describe the diversity of the Etheostoma nigrum complex. Our analyses also identify gene flow among recently diverged lineages, including one instance involving E. susanae, a localized and endangered species. Phylogeographic structure within the Etheostoma nigrum species complex coincides with major geologic events, such as parallel divergence in river basins during Pliocene inundation of the Atlantic coastal plain and multiple northward post-glacial colonization routes tracking river basin rearrangements. Our study serves as a nuanced example of how low dispersal rates coupled with geographic isolation among disconnected river systems in eastern North America has produced one of the world's freshwater biodiversity hotspots.",Phylogeography; Population structure; Allopatric speciation; Secondary contact; Gene flow; ddRAD,2023,178,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107645,1055-7903,13,119,262,1893,6,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,Re-evaluating and dating myriapod diversification with phylotranscriptomics under a regime of dense taxon sampling,"Recent transcriptomic studies of myriapod phylogeny have been based on relatively small datasets with <40 myriapod terminals and variably supported or contradicted the traditional morphological groupings of Progoneata and Dignatha. Here we amassed a large dataset of 104 myriapod terminals, including multiple species for each of the four myriapod classes. Across the tree, most nodes are stable and well supported. Most analyses across a range of gene occupancy levels provide moderate to strong support for a deep split of Myriapoda into Symphyla + Pauropoda (=Edafopoda) and an uncontradicted grouping of Chilopoda + Diplopoda (=Pectinopoda nov.), as in other recent transcriptome-based analyses; no analysis recovers Progoneata or Dignatha as clades. As in all recent multi-locus and phylogenomic studies, chilopod interrelationships resolve with Craterostigmus excluded from Amalpighiata rather than uniting with other centipedes with maternal brood care in Phylactometria. Diplopod ordinal interrelationships are largely congruent with morphology-based classifications. Chilognathan clades that are not invariably advocated by morphologists include Glomerida + Glomeridesmida, such that the volvation-related characters of pill millipedes may be convergent, and Stemmiulida + Polydesmida more closely allied to Juliformia than to Callipodida + Chordeumatida. The latter relationship implies homoplasy in spinnerets and contradicts Nematophora. A time-tree with nodes calibrated by 25 myriapod and six outgroup fossil terminals recovers Cambrian-Ordovician divergences for the deepest splits in Myriapoda, Edafopoda and Pectinopoda, predating the terrestrial fossil record of myriapods as in other published chronograms, whereas age estimates within Chilopoda and Diplopoda overlap with or do not appreciably predate the calibration fossils. The grouping of Chilopoda and Diplopoda is recovered in all our analyses and is formalized as Pectinopoda nov., named for the shared presence of mandibular comb lamellae. New taxonomic proposals for Chilopoda based on uncontradicted clades are Tykhepoda nov. for the three blind families of Scolopendromorpha that share a ``sievetype{''} gizzard, and Taktikospina nov. for Scolopendromorpha to the exclusion of Mimopidae.",Chilopoda; Diplopoda; Myriapoda; Symphyla; Pauropoda; Molecular phylogeny; Molecular dating; Fossils,2023,178,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107621,1055-7903,14,114,309,2268,8,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,Slow and steady wins the race: Diversification rate is independent from body size and lifestyle in Malagasy skinks (Squamata: Scincidae: Scincinae),"Most of the unique and diverse vertebrate fauna that inhabits Madagascar derives from in situ diversification from colonisers that reached this continental island through overseas dispersal. The endemic Malagasy Scincinae lizards are amongst the most species-rich squamate groups on the island. They colonised all bioclimatic zones and display many ecomorphological adaptations to a fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. Here we propose a new phylogenetic hypothesis for their diversification based on the largest taxon sampling so far compiled for this group. We estimated divergence times and investigated several aspects of their diversification (diversification rate, body size and fossorial lifestyle evolution, and biogeography). We found that diversification rate was constant throughout most of the evolutionary history of the group, but decreased over the last 6-4 million years and independently from body size and fossorial lifestyle evolution. Fossoriality has evolved from fully quadrupedal ancestors at least five times independently, which demonstrates that even complex morphological syndromes - in this case involving traits such as limb regression, body elongation, modification of cephalic scalation, depigmentation, and eyes and ear-opening regression - can evolve repeatedly and independently given enough time and eco-evolutionary advantages. Initial diversification of the group likely occurred in forests, and the divergence of sand-swimmer genera around 20 Ma appears linked to a period of aridification. Our results show that the large phenotypic variability of Malagasy Scincinae has not influenced diversification rate and that their rich species diversity results from a constant accumulation of lineages through time. By compiling large geographic and trait-related datasets together with the computation of a new time tree for the group, our study contributes important insights on the diversification of Malagasy vertebrates.",Biogeography; Evolutionary radiations; Fossoriality; In situ diversification; Islands; Madagascar,2023,178,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107635,1055-7903,21,147,271,1952,6,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,Two new tardigrade genera from New Zealand?s Southern Alp glaciers display morphological stasis and parallel evolution,"Tardigrada is an invertebrate phylum that often constitutes a dominant micrometazoan group on glaciers worldwide. We investigated tardigrades residing in surface ice above the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) on three temperate glaciers of New Zealand's Southern Alps. Morphological, morphometric and multilocus DNA analyses (CO1, 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, ITS-2) revealed two new genera comprising four species, of which two are formally described here: Kopakaius gen. nov. nicolae sp. nov. and Kararehius gen. nov. gregorii sp. nov. The former is represented by three genetically distinct phyletic lineages akin to species. According to CO1, Kopakaius gen. nov. nicolae sp. nov. inhabits Whataroa Glacier only while the remaining two Kopakaius species occur on Fox and Franz Joseph Glaciers, suggesting low dispersal capabilities. Although morphological characteristics of the new genera could indicate affinity with the subfamily Itaquasconinae, phylogenetic analysis placed them confidently in the subfamily Diphasconinae. Kopakaius gen. nov. lack placoids in the pharynx similar with some Ita-quasconinae, whereas dark pigmentation and claw shape aligns them with the glacier-obligate genus, Cryobiotus (subfamily Hypsibiinae), which is an example of parallel evolution. The second genus, Kararehius gen nov. could be classified as Adropion-like (subfamily Itaquasconinae), but differs greatly by genetics (placed in the subfamily Diphasconinae) as well as morphology (e.g., lack of septulum), exemplify deep stasis in Hypsibiidae.

MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,Alternative nitrogenase of Paenibacillus sonchi genomovar Riograndensis: An insight in the origin of Fe-nitrogenase in the Paenibacillaceae family,"Paenibacillus sonchi genomovar Riograndensis is a nitrogen-fixing bacteria isolated from wheat that displays diverse plant growth-promoting abilities. Beyond conventional Mo-nitrogenase, this organism also harbors an alternative Fe-nitrogenase, whose many aspects related to regulation, physiology, and evolution remain to be elucidated. In this work, the origins of this alternative system were investigated, exploring the distribution and diversification of nitrogenases in the Panibacillaceae family. Our analysis showed that diazotrophs represent 17\% of Paenibacillaceae genomes, of these, only 14.4\% (2.5\% of all Paenibacillaceae genomes) also contained Fe or V-nitrogenases. Diverse nif-like sequences were also described, occurring mainly in genomes that also harbor the alternative systems. The analysis of genomes containing Fe-nitrogenase showed a conserved cluster of nifEN anfHDGK across three genera: Gorillibacterium, Fontibacillus, and Paenibacillus. A phylogeny of anfHDGK sepa-rated the Fe-nitrogenases into three main groups. Our analysis suggested that Fe-nitrogenase was acquired by the ancestral lineage of Fontibacillus, Gorillibacterium, and Paenibacillus genera via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and further events of transfer and gene loss marked the evolution of this alternative nitrogenase in these groups. The species phylogeny of N-fixing Paenibacillaceae separated the diazotrophs into five clades, one of these containing all occurrences of strains harboring alternative nitrogenases in the Paenibacillus genus. The pan-genome of this clade is open and composed of more than 96\% of accessory genes. Diverse functional categories were enriched in the flexible genome, including functions related to replication and repair. The latter involved diverse genes related to HGT, suggesting that such events may have an important role in the evolution of diazotrophic Paenibacillus.

While molecular phylogenies have been key to establishing the suprafamilial backbone of the charadriiform tree, a number of relationships at both deep and shallow taxonomic levels remain poorly resolved. The timescale of shorebird evolution also remains uncertain as a result of extensive disagreements among the published divergence dating studies, stemming largely from different choices of fossil calibrations. Here, we present the most comprehensive non-supertree phylogeny of shorebirds to date, based on a total-evidence dataset comprising 353 ingroup taxa (90\% of all extant or recently extinct species), 27 loci (15 mitochondrial and 12 nuclear), and 69 morphological characters. We further clarify the timeline of charadriiform evolution by time-scaling this phylogeny using a set of 14 up-to-date and thor-oughly vetted fossil calibrations. In addition, we assemble a taxonomically restricted 100-locus dataset specif-ically designed to resolve outstanding problems in higher-level charadriiform phylogeny. In terms of tree topology, our results are largely congruent with previous studies but indicate that some of the conflicts among earlier analyses reflect a genuine signal of pervasive gene tree discordance. Monophyly of the plovers (Chara-driidae), the position of the ibisbill (Ibidorhyncha), and the relationships among the five subfamilies of the gulls (Laridae) could not be resolved even with greatly increased locus and taxon sampling. Moreover, several localized regions of uncertainty persist in shallower parts of the tree, including the interrelationships of the true auks (Alcinae) and anarhynchine plovers. Our node-dating and macroevolutionary rate analyses find support for a Paleocene origin of crown-group shorebirds, as well as exceptionally rapid recent radiations of Old World oystercatchers (Haematopodidae) and select genera of gulls. Our study underscores the challenges involved in estimating a comprehensively sampled and carefully calibrated time tree for a diverse avian clade, and highlights areas in need of further research.",Phylogeny; Birds; Charadriiformes; Fossil calibrations; Macroevolution,2022,177,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107620,1055-7903,15,112,314,2250,5,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,Evolutionary history of metazoan TMEM16 family,"Most of Transmembrane protein 16 (TMEM16) family members function as either a Ca2+-activated Cl- channel (CaCC) or phospholipid scramblase (CaPLSase) and play diverse physiological roles. It is well conserved in eu-karyotes; however, the origin and evolution of different subfamilies in Metazoa are not yet understood. To uncover the evolutionary history of the TMEM16 family, we analyzed 398 proteins from 74 invertebrate species using evolutionary genomics. We found that the TMEM16C-F and J subfamilies are vertebrate-specific, but the TMEM16A/B, G, H, and K subfamilies are ancient and present in many, but not all metazoan species. The most ancient subfamilies in Metazoa, TMEM16L and M, are only maintained in limited species. TMEM16N and O are Cnidaria-and Ecdysozoa-specific subfamilies, respectively, and Ctenophora, Xenacoelomorpha, and Rotifera contain species-specific proteins. We also identified TMEM16 genes that are closely linked together in the genome, suggesting that they have been generated via recent gene duplication. The anoctamin domain structures of invertebrate-specific TMEM16 proteins predicted by AlphaFold2 contain conserved Ca2+-binding motifs and permeation pathways with either narrow or wide inner gates. The inner gate distance of TMEM16 protein may have frequently switched during metazoan evolution, and thus determined the function of the protein as either CaCC or CaPLSase. These results demonstrate that TMEM16 family has evolved by gene gain and loss in metazoans, and the genes have been generally under purifying selection to maintain protein structures and physiological functions.",TMEM16 family; Evolution; Gene gain and loss; Structure-function relationship; Selective force,2022,177,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107595,1055-7903,6,46,231,1626,5,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,"Insights into the phylogeny of the family Deviatidae (Protozoa, Ciliophora, Hypotrichia) based on multi-gene, morphological and ontogenetic information, with the establishment of a new species Deviata multilineae n. sp.","Hitherto, the phylogeny of ciliated protists, an important group of model organisms in many fields, has been mainly based on a single marker gene (SSU rDNA, nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene). However, there is increasing evidence showing this is insufficient to provide robust phylogenies and has resulted in confusing systematics in many ciliates groups. Among these, the phylogenies within family Deviatidae (Spirotrichea, Hypotrichia) are ambiguous due to the dependence on SSU rDNA and undersampling. Here, we provide eight new sequences and conduct phylogenetic analyses based on both multi-gene and single-gene to clarify evolu-tionary relationships among all deviatids for which gene sequence are available. The results reveal that: (1) the monophyly of Deviatidae is well-supported by both single-gene and concatenated data; (2) the presence of fine cirri and relatively wide spacing of these cirri within all rows are plesiomorphies of Deviatidae; (3) Pseudosincirra longicirrata is closely related to Deviata rositae, which is supported by their shared possession of dorsomarginal kineties; (4) phylogenetic analyses and approximately unbiased test based on multi-gene support a close rela-tionship among taxa lacking dorsomarginal kineties (D. parabacilliformis, D. multilineae nov. spec., D. abbrevescens, D. brasiliensis and Perisincirra paucicirrata); (5) Deviatidae shows a close relationship with Dor-somarginalia and Strongylidium-Hemiamphisiella-Pseudouroleptus assemblage, suggesting the presence/absence of dorsomarginal kineties is phylogenetically informative in this family and presence of them may be a plesio-morphy. Based on the morphological, morphogenetic and phylogenetic data, the evolutionary relationships within Deviatidae are hypothesized, and a new ciliate, Deviata multilineae nov. spec., collected from China, is investigated.",Ciliates; Deviata multilineae; Deviatidae; Morphogenesis; Systematics,2022,177,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107623,1055-7903,29,219,251,1871,5,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,"Multi-locus phylogeny and species delimitations of the striped-back shrew group (Eulipotyphla: Soricidae): Implications for cryptic diversity, taxonomy and multiple speciation patterns","The striped-back shrew group demonstrates remarkable variation in skull and body size, tail length, and brightness of the dorsal stripe; and karyotypic and DNA variation has been reported in recent years. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic structure of the group, as well as speciation patterns and demographic history in Mountains of Southwestern China and adjacent mountains, including the southern Himalayas, Mts. Bashan, Wushan, and Qinling. We sequenced a total of 462 specimens from 126 localities in the known range of the group, which were sequenced and analyzed based on 6.2 kb of sequence data from two mitochondrial, six nu-clear, and two Y chromosome markers. Phylogenetic analyses of the concatenated mtDNA data revealed 14 sympatric and independently evolving lineages within the striped-back shrew group, including Sorex bedfordiae, S. cylindricauda, S. excelsus, S. sinalis and several cryptic species. All concatenated data (ten genes) showed a consistent genetic structure compared to the mtDNA lineages for the group, whereas the nuclear and the Y chromosome data showed a discordant genetic structure compared to the mtDNA lineages for the striped-back shrew group. Species delimitation analyses and deep genetic distance clearly support the species status of the 14 evolving lineages. The divergence time estimation suggested that the striped-back shrew group began to diversify from the middle Pleistocene (2.34 Ma), then flourished at approximately 2.14 Ma, followed by a series of rapid diversifications through the Pleistocene. Our results also revealed multiple mechanisms of speciation in the Mountains of Southwestern China and Adjacent Mountains with complex landscapes and climate. The uplifting of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Quaternary climate oscillations, riverine barriers, ecological elevation gradients, topographical diversity, and their own low dispersal capacity may have driven the speciation, genetic structure, and phylogeographic patterns of the striped-back shrew group.",Soricinae; Sorex; Species delimitation; Speciation; Southwestern China,2022,177,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107619,1055-7903,21,184,290,2029,5,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,"One-way ticket to the blue: A large-scale, dated phylogeny revealed asymmetric land-to-water transitions in acariform mites (Acari: Acariformes)","Acariform mites are an ancient and megadiverse lineage that may have experienced a complex pattern of in-vasions into terrestrial and aquatic habitats. These among-realm transitions may relate to periods of turmoil in Earth's history or be simply results of uneven biodiversity patterns across habitats. Here, we inferred a dated, representative acariform phylogeny (five genes, 9,200 bp aligned, 367 terminals belonging to 150 ingroup plus 15 outgroup families, 23 fossil calibration points) which was used to infer transitions between marine/fresh-water/terrestrial habitats. We detected four unambiguous transitions from terrestrial to freshwater habitats (Hydrozetes, Naiadacarus, Fusohericia, Afronothrus, Homocaligus); one from freshwater to marine (Pontar-achnidae), and four from marine to brackish or freshwater transitions (all among Halacaridae: Acarothrix; Halacarellus petiti; Copidognathus sp.; clade Limnohalacarus + Soldanellonyx + Porohalacarus + Porolohmannella). One transition to the sea was inferred ambiguously with respect to the ancestor being either terrestrial or freshwater (Hyadesiidae), and another must be most carefully examined by adding potential related taxa (Selenoribatidae + Fortuyniidae). Finally, we inferred a single, remarkable transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats involving early evolution of the large and ecologically diverse lineage: the ancestor of the Halacaridae + Parasitengona clade was probably freshwater given our dataset, thus making terrestrial Parasitengona second-arily terrestrial. Overall, our results suggested a strong asymmetry in environmental transitions: the majority occurred from terrestrial to aquatic habitats. This asymmetry is probably linked to mites' biological properties and uneven biodiversity patterns across habitats rather than Earth's geological history. Since the land holds more acariform diversity than water habitats, a shift from the former is more likely than from the latter. We inferred the following relationships: alicid endeostigmatid + eriophyoid (Alycidae, (Nanorchestidae, (Nematalycidae, Eriophyoidea))) being sister group to the remaining Acariformes: (proteonematalycid Endeostigmata, alico-rhagiid Endeostigmata, Trombidiformes, Oribatida (including Astigmata)). Trombidiform relationships had several novel rearrangements: (i) traditional Eupodina lacked support for the inclusion of Bdelloidea; (ii) Ten-eriffidae, traditionally placed among Anystina, was consistently recovered in a clade including Heterostigmata in Eleutherengona; (iii) several lineages, such as Adamystidae, Paratydeidae, Caeculidae and Erythracaridae, were recovered in a large clade along other Anystina and Eleutherengona, suggesting single origins of several fundamental character states, such as the reduction of the cheliceral fixed digit and development of the palpal thumb-claw complex.",Secondarily marine taxa; Marine -freshwater transitions; Divergence time estimation; Halacaridae; Parasitengona,2022,177,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107626,1055-7903,18,144,367,2876,5,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,Phylogenomics and body shape morphometrics reveal recent diversification in the goatfishes (Syngnatharia: Mullidae),"Clades of marine fishes exhibit many patterns of diversification, ranging from relatively constant throughout time to rapid changes in the rates of speciation and extinction. The goatfishes (Syngnatharia: Mullidae) are a family of marine, reef associated fishes with a relatively recent origin, distributed globally in tropical and temperate waters. Despite their abundance and economic importance, the goatfishes remain one of the few coral reef families for which the species level relationships have not been examined using genomic techniques. Here we use phylogenomic analysis of ultra-conserved elements (UCE) and exon data to resolve a well-supported, time-calibrated phylogeny for 72 species of goatfishes, supporting a recent crown age of the goatfishes at 21.9 million years ago. We used this framework to test hypotheses about the associations among body shape mor-phometrics, taxonomy, and phylogeny, as well as to explore relative diversification rates across the phylogeny. Body shape was strongly associated with generic-level taxonomy of goatfishes, with morphometric analyses showing evidence for high phylogenetic signal across all morphotypes. Rates of diversification in this clade reveal a recent sharp increase in lineage accumulation, with 92\% of the goatfish species sampled across all clades and major body plans having originated in just the past 5 million years. We suggest that habitat diversity in the early Pliocene oceans and the generalist ecology of goatfishes are key factors in the unusual evolutionary tempo of the family Mullidae.",UCE; Exon capture; Evolution; Morphology; Phylogeny; Coral reefs,2022,177,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107616,1055-7903,13,115,229,1567,6,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,Phylogenomics reveals extensive introgression and a case of mito-nuclear discordance in the killifish genus Kryptolebias,"Introgression is a widespread evolutionary process leading to phylogenetic inconsistencies among distinct parts of the genomes, particularly between mitochondrial and nuclear-based phylogenetic reconstructions (e.g., mito-nuclear discordances). Here, we used mtDNA and genome-wide nuclear sites to provide the first phylogenomic-based hypothesis on the evolutionary relationships within the killifish genus Kryptolebias. In addition, we tested for evidence of past introgression in the genus given the multiple reports of undergoing hybridization between its members. Our mtDNA phylogeny generally agreed with the relationships previously proposed for the genus. However, our reconstruction based on nuclear DNA revealed an unknown lineage -Kryptolebias sp. `ESP' - as the sister group of the self-fertilizing mangrove killifishes, K. marmoratus and K. hermaphroditus. All individuals sequenced of Kryptolebias sp. `ESP' had the same mtDNA haplotype commonly observed in K. hermaphroditus, demonstrating a clear case of mito-nuclear discordance. Our analysis further confirmed extensive history of introgression between Kryptolebias sp. `ESP' and K. hermaphroditus. Population genomics analyses indicate no current gene flow between the two lineages, despite their current sympatry and history of introgression. We also confirmed introgression between other species pairs in the genus that have been recently reported to form hybrid zones. Overall, our study provides a phylogenomic reconstruction covering most of the Kryptolebias species, reveals a new lineage hidden in a case of mito-nuclear discordance, and provides evidence of multiple events of ancestral introgression in the genus. These findings underscore the importance of investigating different genomic information in a phylogenetic framework, particularly in taxa where introgression is common as in the sexually diverse mangrove killifishes.",Hermaphroditism; Mating systems; Mangrove; Mangrove rivulus; Self-fertilization; Rivulidae,2022,177,NA,10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107617,1055-7903,15,120,256,1907,6,NA,200,6,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,Central-place foraging poses variable constraints year-round in a neotropical migrant,"Background ``Central-place foragers{''} are constrained in their habitat selection and foraging range by the frequency with which they need to return to a central place. For example, chick-rearing songbirds that must feed their offspring hourly might be expected to have smaller foraging ranges compared to non-breeding songbirds that return nightly to a roost. Methods We used GPS units to compare the foraging behaviour of an aerial insectivorous bird, the purple martin (Progne subis), during the breeding season in three regions across North America, as well as the non-breeding season in South America. Specifically, we tested foraging range size and habitat selection. Results Foraging range did not vary among regions during breeding (14.0 +/- 39.2 km(2)) and was larger during the nonbreeding period (8840 +/- 8150 km(2)). Purple martins strongly preferred aquatic habitats to other available habitats year-round and in the Amazon commuted from night roosts in low productivity sediment-poor water, where risk of predation was probably low, to daytime foraging sites in productive sediment-rich water sites. Conclusions We provide the first estimates for foraging range size in purple martins and demonstrate foraging preference for aquatic habitats throughout two stages of the annual cycle. Understanding foraging constraints and habitat of aerial insectivores may help plan conservation actions throughout their annual cycle. Future research should quantify foraging behaviour during the post-breeding period and during migration.",Aerial insectivore; Biologging; Foraging; Habitat selection; Home range; Songbird,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00337-2,2051-3933,10,85,223,1541,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,Personality drives activity and space use in a mammalian herbivore,"Background Animal personality has emerged as a key concept in behavioral ecology. While many studies have demonstrated the influence of personality traits on behavioral patterns, its quantification, especially in wild animal populations, remains a challenge. Only a few studies have established a link between personality and recurring movements within home ranges, although these small-scale movements are of key importance for identifying ecological interactions and forming individual niches. In this regard, differences in space use among individuals might reflect different exploration styles between behavioral types along the shy-bold continuum. Methods We assessed among-individual differences in behavior in the European hare (Lepus europaeus), a characteristic mammalian herbivore in agricultural landscapes using a standardized box emergence test for captive and wild hares. We determined an individuals' degree of boldness by measuring the latencies of behavioral responses in repeated emergence tests in captivity. During capture events of wild hares, we conducted a single emergence test and recorded behavioral responses proven to be stable over time in captive hares. Applying repeated novel environment tests in a near-natural enclosure, we further quantified aspects of exploration and activity in captive hares. Finally, we investigated whether and how this among-individual behavioral variation is related to general activity and space use in a wild hare population. Wild and captive hares were treated similarly and GPS-collared with internal accelerometers prior to release to the wild or the outdoor enclosure, respectively. General activity was quantified as overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) obtained from accelerometers. Finally, we tested whether boldness explained variation in (i) ODBA in both settings and (ii) variation in home ranges and core areas across different time scales of GPS-collared hares in a wild population. Results We found three behavioral responses to be consistent over time in captive hares. ODBA was positively related to boldness (i.e., short latencies to make first contact with the new environment) in both captive and wild hares. Space use in wild hares also varied with boldness, with shy individuals having smaller core areas and larger home ranges than bold conspecifics (yet in some of the parameter space, this association was just marginally significant). Conclusions Against our prediction, shy individuals occupied relatively large home ranges but with small core areas. We suggest that this space use pattern is due to them avoiding risky, and energy-demanding competition for valuable resources. Carefully validated, activity measurements (ODBA) from accelerometers provide a valuable tool to quantify aspects of animal personality along the shy-bold continuum remotely. Without directly observing-and possibly disturbing-focal individuals, this approach allows measuring variability in animal personality, especially in species that are difficult to assess with experiments. Considering that accelerometers are often already built into GPS units, we recommend activating them at least during the initial days of tracking to estimate individual variation in general activity and, if possible, match them with a simple novelty experiment. Furthermore, information on individual behavioral types will help to facilitate mechanistic understanding of processes that drive spatial and ecological dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes.",Animal personality; Movement ecology; Inter-individual differences; ODBA; Energy expenditure; European hare,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00333-6,2051-3933,10,66,492,3501,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,yes,no,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,Drivers of polar bear behavior and the possible effects of prey availability on foraging strategy,"Background Change in behavior is one of the earliest responses to variation in habitat suitability. It is therefore important to understand the conditions that promote different behaviors, particularly in areas undergoing environmental change. Animal movement is tightly linked to behavior and remote tracking can be used to study ethology when direct observation is not possible. Methods We used movement data from 14 polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in Hudson Bay, Canada, during the foraging season (January-June), when bears inhabit the sea ice. We developed an error-tolerant method to correct for sea ice drift in tracking data. Next, we used hidden Markov models with movement and orientation relative to wind to study three behaviors (stationary, area-restricted search, and olfactory search) and examine effects of 11 covariates on behavior. Results Polar bears spent approximately 47\% of their time in the stationary drift state, 29\% in olfactory search, and 24\% in area-restricted search. High energy behaviors occurred later in the day (around 20:00) compared to other populations. Second, olfactory search increased as the season progressed, which may reflect a shift in foraging strategy from still-hunting to active search linked to a shift in seal availability (i.e., increase in haul-outs from winter to the spring pupping and molting seasons). Last, we found spatial patterns of distribution linked to season, ice concentration, and bear age that may be tied to habitat quality and competitive exclusion. Conclusions Our observations were generally consistent with predictions of the marginal value theorem, and differences between our findings and other populations could be explained by regional or temporal variation in resource availability. Our novel movement analyses and finding can help identify periods, regions, and conditions of critical habitat.",Polar bear; Behavior; Foraging strategy; Optimal foraging; Telemetry; Hidden Markov Model,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00351-4,2051-3933,15,97,277,1875,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,Seasonal and inter-annual variation in exposure to peregrines (Falco peregrinus) for southbound western sandpipers (Calidris mauri),"Background The western sandpiper (Calidris mauri) is an early southbound migrant species in North America. The `peregrine avoidance' hypothesis proposes that this timing evolved to reduce exposure to their main predator, the peregrine (Falco peregrinus), along the Pacific flyway. Methods I evaluate this hypothesis based on 16 years of near-daily (June - October) measures of peregrine presence made on the Fraser River estuary, a major stopover in the Pacific northwest. Results Exposure to peregrines is lowest for the earliest southbound western sandpipers, and rises steeply as peregrines en route from northern breeding areas begin to arrive in late July or August. Peregrine arrival timing varies greatly between years, shifting in step with the onset of spring along coastal Alaska. Peregrine presence on the Fraser estuary on any date is higher in years with earlier spring onset. On the median adult sandpiper passage date (day-of-year 198) this increases 17-fold over the inter-annual range between the earliest and latest peregrine arrival dates. Conclusion The pattern of strong and predictable changes in the seasonal pattern of danger quantified here provides a further test of the hypothesis that danger affects migratory timing. Western sandpipers appear to anticipate the exposure level of southward migration, perhaps because they are able to observe spring onset on their Alaskan breeding grounds. They adjust the duration of parental care and length of the breeding season to keep the date of migratory departure from the Arctic relatively invariant in spite of large interannual variation in spring onset. While underway they also adjust aspects of migratory behavior. These observations support the `peregrine avoidance' hypothesis, and suggest that western sandpipers are able to counter, at least partially, the higher migratory danger of early spring years.",Predation danger; Long-distance migration; Anti-predator behavior,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00343-4,2051-3933,16,131,283,1883,3,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,Movement and habitat selection of a large carnivore in response to human infrastructure differs by life stage,"Background The movement extent of mammals is influenced by human-modified areas, which can affect population demographics. Understanding how human infrastructure influences movement at different life stages is important for wildlife management. This is true especially for large carnivores, due to their substantial space requirements and potential for conflict with humans. Methods We investigated human impact on movement and habitat selection by GPS-collared male brown bears (Ursus arctos) in two life stages (residents and dispersers) in central Sweden. We identified dispersers visually based on their GPS locations and used hidden Markov models to delineate dispersal events. We used integrated step selection analysis (iSSA) to infer movement and habitat selection at a local scale (availability defined by hourly relocations), and resource selection functions (RSFs) to infer habitat selection at a landscape scale (availability defined by the study area extent). Results Movement of residents on a local scale was facilitated by small forestry roads as they moved faster and selected areas closer to forestry roads, and they avoided areas closer to larger public roads and buildings on both scales. Dispersers were more ambivalent in their response to human infrastructure. Dispersers increased their speed closer to small forestry roads and larger public roads, did not exhibit selection for or against any road class, and avoided areas closer to buildings only at local scale. Dispersers did not select for any features on the landscape, which is likely explained by the novelty of the landscape or their naivety towards it. Conclusion Our results show that movement in male brown bears is life stage-dependent and indicate that connectivity maps derived from movement data of dispersing animals may provide more numerous and more realistic pathways than those derived from resident animal data alone. This suggests that data from dispersing animals provide more realistic models for reconnecting populations and maintaining connectivity than if data were derived from resident animals alone.",Human disturbance; Human-modified; Roads; Settlements; Life stage; Home range; Dispersal; Brown bear; Connectivity,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00349-y,2051-3933,17,109,311,2104,9,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,Behavioural flexibility in an Arctic seabird using two distinct marine habitats to survive the energetic constraints of winter,"Background Homeothermic marine animals in Polar Regions face an energetic bottleneck in winter. The challenges of short days and cold temperatures are exacerbated for flying seabirds with small body size and limited fat stores. We use biologging approaches to examine how habitat, weather, and moon illumination influence behaviour and energetics of a marine bird species, thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia). Methods We used temperature-depth-light recorders to examine strategies murres use to survive winter in the Northwest Atlantic, where contrasting currents create two distinct marine habitats: cold (-0.1 +/- 1.2 degrees C), shallower water along the Labrador Shelf and warmer (3.1 +/- 0.3 degrees C), deep water in the Labrador Basin. Results In the cold shelf water, murres used a high-energy strategy, with more flying and less diving each day, resulting in high daily energy expenditure and also high apparent energy intake; this strategy was most evident in early winter when day lengths were shortest. By contrast, murres in warmer basin water employed a low-energy strategy, with less time flying and more time diving under low light conditions (nautical twilight and night). In warmer basin water, murres increased diving at night when the moon was more illuminated, likely taking advantage of diel vertically migrating prey. In warmer basin water, murres dove more at night and foraging efficiency increased under negative North Atlantic Oscillation (calmer ocean conditions). Conclusions The proximity of two distinct marine habitats in this region allows individuals from a single species to use dual (low-energy/high-energy) strategies to overcome winter energy bottlenecks.",Non-breeding; Nocturnal foraging; Uria lomvia; Labrador Sea; Daily activity rate; Biologging,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00344-3,2051-3933,18,126,251,1692,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,Linking migration and microbiota at a major stopover site in a long-distance avian migrant,"Migration is one of the most physical and energetically demanding periods in an individual bird's life. The composition of the bird's gut or cloacal microbiota can temporarily change during migration, likely due to differences in diets, habitats and other environmental conditions experienced en route. However, how physiological condition, migratory patterns, and other drivers interact to affect microbiota composition of migratory birds is still unclear. We sampled the cloacal bacterial microbiota of a long-distance migrant, the steppe buzzard (Buteo buteo vulpinus), at an important spring stopover bottleneck in Eilat, Israel, after crossing the ca. 1800 km Sahara Desert. We examined whether diversity and composition of the cloacal microbiota varied with body condition, sex, movement patterns (i.e., arrival time and migration distance), and survival. Early arrival to Eilat was associated with better body condition, longer post-Eilat spring migration distance, higher microbial alpha-diversity, and differences in microbiota composition. Specifically, early arrivals had higher abundance of the phylum Synergistota and five genera, including Jonquetella and Peptococcus, whereas the phylum Proteobacteria and genus Escherichia-Shigella (as well as three other genera) were more abundant in later arrivals. While the differences in alpha-diversity and Escherichia-Shigella seem to be mainly driven by body condition, other compositional differences associated with arrival date could be indicators of longer migratory journeys (e.g., pre-fueling at wintering grounds or stopover habitats along the way) or migratory performance. No significant differences were found between the microbiota of surviving and non-surviving individuals. Overall, our results indicate that variation in steppe buzzard microbiota is linked to variation in migratory patterns (i.e., capture/arrival date) and body condition, highlighting the importance of sampling the microbiota of GPS-tracked individuals on multiple occasions along their migration routes to gain a more detailed understanding of the links between migration, microbiota, and health in birds.",Cloacal microbiota; Long-distance migration; Steppe buzzard; Stopover bottleneck; GPS-tracking,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00347-0,2051-3933,14,90,293,2148,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,A framework for integrating inferred movement behavior into disease risk models,"Movement behavior is an important contributor to habitat selection and its incorporation in disease risk models has been somewhat neglected. The habitat preferences of host individuals affect their probability of exposure to pathogens. If preference behavior can be incorporated in ecological niche models (ENMs) when data on pathogen distributions are available, then variation in such behavior may dramatically impact exposure risk. Here we use data from the anthrax endemic system of Etosha National Park, Namibia, to demonstrate how integrating inferred movement behavior alters the construction of disease risk maps. We used a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model that associated soil, bioclimatic, and vegetation variables with the best available pathogen presence data collected at anthrax carcass sites to map areas of most likely Bacillus anthracis (the causative bacterium of anthrax) persistence. We then used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to distinguish foraging and non-foraging behavioral states along the movement tracks of nine zebra (Equus quagga) during the 2009 and 2010 anthrax seasons. The resulting tracks, decomposed on the basis of the inferred behavioral state, formed the basis of step-selection functions (SSFs) that used the MaxEnt output as a potential predictor variable. Our analyses revealed different risks of exposure during different zebra behavioral states, which were obscured when the full movement tracks were analyzed without consideration of the underlying behavioral states of individuals. Pathogen (or vector) distribution models may be misleading with regard to the actual risk faced by host animal populations when specific behavioral states are not explicitly accounted for in selection analyses. To more accurately evaluate exposure risk, especially in the case of environmentally transmitted pathogens, selection functions could be built for each identified behavioral state and then used to assess the comparative exposure risk across relevant states.

MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,Identification of reindeer fine-scale foraging behaviour using tri-axial accelerometer data,"Animal behavioural responses to the environment ultimately affect their survival. Monitoring animal fine-scale behaviour may improve understanding of animal functional response to the environment and provide an important indicator of the welfare of both wild and domesticated species. In this study, we illustrate the application of collar-attached acceleration sensors for investigating reindeer fine-scale behaviour. Using data from 19 reindeer, we tested the supervised machine learning algorithms Random forests, Support vector machines, and hidden Markov models to classify reindeer behaviour into seven classes: grazing, browsing low from shrubs or browsing high from trees, inactivity, walking, trotting, and other behaviours. We implemented leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to assess generalizable results on new individuals. Our main results illustrated that hidden Markov models were able to classify collar-attached accelerometer data into all our pre-defined behaviours of reindeer with reasonable accuracy while Random forests and Support vector machines were biased towards dominant classes. Random forests using 5-s windows had the highest overall accuracy (85\%), while hidden Markov models were able to best predict individual behaviours and handle rare behaviours such as trotting and browsing high. We conclude that hidden Markov models provide a useful tool to remotely monitor reindeer and potentially other large herbivore species behaviour. These methods will allow us to quantify fine-scale behavioural processes in relation to environmental events.",Activity recognition; Tri-axial accelerometer; Random forests; Support vector machines; Hidden Markov models; Rangifer tarandus,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00339-0,2051-3933,10,91,214,1579,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,"A 30,000-km journey by Apus apus pekinensis tracks arid lands between northern China and south-western Africa","Background As a widely distributed and aerial migratory bird, the Common Swift (Apus apus) flies over a wide geographic range in Eurasia and Africa during migration. Although some studies have revealed the migration routes and phenology of European populations, A. a. apus (from hereon the nominate apus), the route used by its East Asian counterpart A. a. pekinensis (from hereon pekinensis) remained a mystery. Methods Using light level geolocators, we studied the migration of adult pekinensis breeding in Beijing from 2014 to 2018, and analysed full annual tracks obtained from 25 individuals. In addition, we used the mean monthly precipitation to assess the seasonal variations in humidity for the distribution ranges of the nominate apus and pekinensis. This environmental variable is considered to be critically relevant to their migratory phenology and food resource abundance. Results Our results show that the swifts perform a round-trip journey of ca 30,000 km each year, representing a detour of 26\% in autumn and 15\% in spring compared to the shortest route between the breeding site in Beijing and wintering areas in semi-arid south-western Africa. Compared to the nominate apus, pekinensis experiences drier conditions for longer periods of time. Remarkably, individuals from our study population tracked arid habitat along the entire migration corridor leading from a breeding site in Beijing to at least central Africa. In Africa, they explored more arid habitats during non-breeding than the nominate apus. Conclusions The migration route followed by pekinensis breeding in Beijing might suggest an adaptation to semi-arid habitat and dry climatic zones during non-breeding periods, and provides a piece of correlative evidence indicating the historical range expansion of the subspecies. This study highlights that the Common Swift may prove invaluable as a model species for studies of migration route formation and population divergence.",Common Swift; Migration; Light-level geolocator; Population divergence; East Asia,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00329-2,2051-3933,16,109,295,1961,5,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,Phenological drivers of ungulate migration in South America: characterizing the movement and seasonal habitat use of guanacos,"Background Migration is a widespread strategy among ungulates to cope with seasonality. Phenology, especially in seasonally snow-covered landscapes featuring ``white waves{''} of snow accumulation and ``green waves{''} of plant green-up, is a phenomenon that many migratory ungulates navigate. Guanacos (Lama guanicoe) are native camelids to South America and might be the last ungulate in South America that migrates. However, a detailed description of guanacos ` migratory attributes, including whether they surf or jump phenological waves is lacking. Methods We quantified the migratory movements of 21 adult guanacos over three years in Patagonia, Argentina. We analyzed annual movement patterns using net squared displacement (NSD) and home range overlap and quantified snow and vegetation phenology via remotely sensed products. Results We found that 74\% of the individual guanacos exhibited altitudinal migrations. For migratory guanacos, we observed fidelity of migratory ranges and residence time, but flexibility around migration propensity, timing, and duration of migration. The scarce vegetation and arid conditions within our study area seemed to prevent guanacos from surfing green waves; instead, guanacos appeared to avoid white waves. Conclusion Our study shows that guanaco elevational migration is driven by a combination of vegetation availability and snow cover, reveals behavioral plasticity of their migration, and highlights the importance of snow phenology as a driver of ungulate migrations.",Phenology; Plasticity; Green waves; Snow cover; Lama guanicoe; GPS data,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00332-7,2051-3933,17,125,214,1519,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,Experience and social factors influence movement and habitat selection in scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah) reintroduced into Chad,"Reintroduced animals-especially those raised in captivity-are faced with the unique challenge of navigating a wholly unfamiliar environment, and often make erratic or extensive movements after release. Naivete to the reintroduction landscape can be costly, e.g., through increased energy expenditure, greater exposure to predation, and reduced opportunities to forage. Integration with an extant population may provide opportunities for social information transfer. However, in the absence of interactions with residents, it is unclear how individual and social learning may affect an animal's ability to track resources in an unfamiliar landscape. We use integrated step selection functions (iSSFs) to address these knowledge gaps, by evaluating the extent to which environmental factors, individual experience (time since release), and social information-sharing (group size) influence movement decisions by scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah) reintroduced into their native range for the first time in ca. 30 years. We found that both experience and social factors influenced the habitat selection and movement behavior of reintroduced oryx. Of four candidate iSSFs, the model that included environmental, experience, and group size variables performed best in both dry and wet periods. Statistically significant interaction terms between environmental variables and experience were generally larger than similar terms for group size, indicating that experience may affect habitat selection by reintroduced oryx more strongly than social factors. These findings may inform the management of recovering wildlife populations, update widely-held expectations about how released ungulates acclimate to novel landscapes, and demonstrate the utility of long-term monitoring of reintroduced populations.",Reintroduction; Integrated step selection functions; Social learning; Post-release experience; Seasonality; Monitoring,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00348-z,2051-3933,17,131,243,1798,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,Scatter-hoarding birds disperse seeds to sites unfavorable for plant regeneration,"Scatter-hoarding birds provide effective long-distance seed dispersal for plants. Transporting seeds far promotes population spread, colonization of new areas, and connectivity between populations. However, whether seeds transported over long distances are deposited in habitats favorable to plant regeneration has rarely been investigated, mainly due to methodological constraints. To investigate dispersal patterns and distances of Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra) seeds we utilized advances in tracking technology to track the movements of their sole disperser, the spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes). We found routine individual movements between single seed harvesting and seed caching site. Harvesting sites of individual birds overlapped, whereas seed caching sites were separated and located on average 5.3 km away from the harvesting site. Interestingly, most distant caching sites were located at low elevations and in spruce forest, where Swiss stone pine does not naturally occur. This suggests that nutcrackers disperse seeds over long distances but that a large portion of these seeds are cached outside the known pine habitat. Therefore, we conclude that the implications of such long-distance seed dispersal movements for plant populations should be carefully considered in combination with the effects of habitat quality on plant recruitment.",Spotted nutcrackers; GPS tracking; Seed dispersal; Ecosystem services; Nucifraga caryocatactes; Pinus cembra,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00338-1,2051-3933,10,81,191,1368,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
MOVEMENT ECOLOGY,"No ``carry-over{''} effects of tracking devices on return rate and parameters determining reproductive success in once and repeatedly tagged common swifts (Apus apus), a long-distance migratory bird","Background: To understand life-history strategies in migratory bird species, we should focus on migration behaviour and possible carry-over effects on both population and individual level. Tracking devices are useful tools to directly investigate migration behaviour. With increased use of tracking devices, questions arise towards animal welfare and possible negative effects of logger on birds. Several studies were conducted to address this question in birds that were tagged and tracked for one complete non-breeding season including migration but with mixed results. To detect individual-based decisions regarding migration strategy, we need to track the same individuals several times. So far, there are no studies investigating effects of repeatedly tagging on reproduction and life-history traits in individual migratory birds, especially in small birds. Methods: We used long-term data of 85 tagged common swifts (Apus apus), a long-distance migratory bird, of a breeding colony in Germany to test whether carrying a geolocator or GPS logger once or repeatedly during non-breeding season affected return rate, apparent survival, and parameters determining reproductive success. Additionally, we checked for individual differences in arrival date and breeding parameters when the same individuals were tagged and when they were not tagged in different years. Further, we calculated the individual repeatability in arrival at the breeding colony and date of egg laying in repeatedly tagged swifts. Results: Once and repeatedly tagged birds returned to the colony at a similar rate as non-logger birds and arrived earlier than non-logger birds. We found no effect of logger-type on return rate in logger birds. We detected no differences in apparent survival, time lag to clutch initiation, date of clutch initiation, clutch size, number of chicks and fledglings between logger and non-logger birds. We found neither an effect of loggers nor of logger-types on the arrival date and breeding parameter on individual-level. Arrival date was highly repeatable and date of clutch initiation was moderately repeatable within repeatedly tagged individuals.",Long-term study; Breeding parameter; Individual consistency; Geolocation; GPS; Apparent survival,2022,10,1,10.1186/s40462-022-00357-y,2051-3933,27,198,314,2156,6,NA,350,10,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL,Canopy Cover and Canopy Heterogeneity Drive Plant Alpha Diversity but Not Beta Diversity in a Midwest Oak Savanna,"Midwest oak savannas contain some of the highest plant diversity in the United States and are among the rarest terrestrial ecosystems globally. Consequently, understanding diversity patterns within these ecosystems is important for setting management and restoration goals. This study aimed to understand the role of canopy cover and heterogeneity in canopy cover in influencing plant alpha and beta diversity within oak savanna ecosystems. This study took place in the black oak savannas of the Indiana Dunes along the southern shores of Lake Michigan in NW Indiana, USA. We sampled twenty-nine 1000 m(2) plots with gradients in canopy cover and canopy heterogeneity across the Indiana Dunes to examine the influence of canopy cover and canopy heterogeneity on plant diversity. Woody plant alpha diversity was highest in areas with a high canopy cover (>75\%). C3 graminoids, C4 graminoids, and sedge alpha diversity were highest in low canopy cover areas (<25\%). Forb and legume alpha diversity were highest with low to intermediate canopy cover (25-50\% and 20-35\%). Overall, plant alpha diversity was highest at intermediate canopy cover. High canopy heterogeneity was associated with high alpha diversity. There was no relationship between canopy cover or canopy heterogeneity with beta diversity. However, beta diversity was exceptionally high within all sites. An average canopy cover of 25-50\% is the optimal cover for promoting high plant diversity across many functional groups. Still, low and high canopy cover sites are also important for maximizing diversity of some functional groups. Therefore, we recommend managing oak savannas for 25-50\% canopy cover to maximize diversity, but where opportunities exist in large remnants of oak savanna, maintaining some areas with few trees and other areas with closed canopies can maximize diversity on a landscape scale.",alpha diversity; beta diversity; conservation; diversity; oak savanna,2022,42,3,10.3375/21-55,0885-8608,18,113,283,1879,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL,Changes in White-Tailed Deer Browsing Selection of Hardwood Tree Species with Increasing Stem Height,"To forage optimally, deer select individual plants highest in limiting nutrients, while avoiding individuals that are high in anti-herbivore defenses. For some woody species, deer may selectively browse on larger stems, which can provide a larger amount of younger, more nutritious tissue per individual. However, in some species, larger stems may possess increased levels of anti-herbivore defenses, ultimately discouraging deer from browsing on these larger individuals. We examined differences in the proportion of twigs and stems (individual seedlings/saplings/trees) browsed across three height classes for four species: blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata Michx,), white ash (F. americana L.), sassafras (Sassafras albidium Nutt.), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum L.), across multiple sites in central Indiana. Overall, we found that taller stems had a higher likelihood of being browsed, but smaller stems were browsed more heavily. We also found that sugar maple twigs and stems were most likely to be browsed, while sassafras twigs and white ash twigs and stems were least likely to be browsed. Our results indicate that under intense browsing pressure, preference should be given to smaller stems for protection, and that stands with greater vertical stratification of palatable species are more resilient to the effects of deer browsing.",browse; Central Hardwood Forest Region; life-stage; palatability; ungulate herbivory,2022,42,4,10.3375/21-29,0885-8608,14,100,198,1345,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL,Darter (Family: Percidae) Abundance in Deep-Water Habitats of the Upper Mississippi River,"Status of several large-river darter species is uncertain because of difficulties sampling deep-water habitats. We characterized the darter (Family: Percidae) community in main and side channel macrohabitats of the upper Mississippi River using a small-mesh benthic trawl at sites in five navigation pools and a portion of the lower St. Croix River encompassing nearly 200 river kilometers in 2016 and 2017. We captured six darter species in conjunction with a survey to assess crystal darter (Crystallaria asprella) (state endangered) status and estimated density (n/700 m(2)) and population size for selected species in navigation pools. No crystal darter were collected in 83 trawl tows, including tows made at historical crystal darter locations. However, a total of 154 western sand darter (Atnmocrypta dam) (globally vulnerable) were captured with density estimates ranging among pools from 1.0 to 9.6 in main channel and 1.0 to 5.0 in side channel macrohabitats. The largest population estimate was 33,286 (95\% confidence limit: 17,974-52,725) for western sand darter in all side channels in Pool 7. A total of 71 river darter (Percina shumardi) were captured with zero caught in some pools to a maximum mean density of 17.5/700 m(2) in Pool 3. Highest population size was 14,829 (8260-25,127) for river darter in the lower St. Croix River. A total of 43 logperch (Percina caprodes) and 143 johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum) were captured but exhibited clumped spatial distributions that hindered population estimates. Only three mud darter (Etheostotna asprigene) and one slenderhead darter (Percina phoxocephala) were captured in deep-water habitats.

NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL,Demographic Modeling Refines Assessment of Three Populations of a Long-Lived Threatened Plant,"Structured demographic models can be valuable for assessing the status of at-risk plant species and for guiding efforts to protect and manage them, but they may be infrequently employed in assessments of species of conservation concern because they require data that are not often available to those charged with management. We constructed and analyzed matrix projection models for three populations of the threatened perennial plant species Euphorbia telephioides to reevaluate a prior assessment of stable status and to compare the conclusions of models based on different amounts of data. In contrast to the prior assessment, all of our models predicted population decline for all three populations. Projected growth rates were similar for models based on sparse sampling and those based on a larger more representative sample of individuals, but the models supported contrasting patterns of the sensitivity of population growth rate to individual demographic transitions. Models based on more complete data supported greater elasticity of growth rate to the demographic fates of small non-flowering plants, which had among the lowest elasticity values for models based on more sparse data. We conclude that even models based on limited data can be useful to species status assessments, but that more complete data may be necessary to identify targets for effective management.",demographic matrix model; Euphorbia telephioides; plant conservation; rare plant demography; stage-structured model,2022,42,1,10.3375/21-12,0885-8608,12,93,209,1380,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

As a free-flowing and protected river, the Buffalo offers natural benefits to humanity (e.g., food production, carbon storage, recreation), known as ecosystem services. Using both market and survey data, we performed the first comprehensive valuation of the ecosystem services that the Buffalo National River provides to Arkansas residents. The total ecosystem services benefits in 2018 USD were valued at \$20.5 million per year (\$550/ha). Most of the value was concentrated in cultural services (i.e., recreation, aesthetics, cognitive development), which were responsible for over 70\% of total value at \$384/ha. Air quality regulation and the provisioning of water also made important contributions to the total, with values of \$103/ha and \$36/ha, respectively. Our study highlights the considerable economic value provided by the Buffalo National River in its current state.

NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL,Extent and Intensity of Vehicle-use Impacts within a Saltmarsh Conservation Area under a Management Strategy,"Saltmarshes provide multiple ecosystem services, and some have been preserved as conservation areas. Studies indicate recreation-related vehicle use may be significantly degrading them. Saltmarshes have a low resistance and resilience to recreation-related trampling impacts; however, little is known about those associated with vehicle use under a specific management strategy. Drone imagery and GIS spatial analysis were used to determine the area and intensity of direct vehicle impacts within a New Zealand saltmarsh. The management plan allows vehicle entry as long as it does not substantially impact cultural, ecological, or mahinga kai (or food cultivation) values. It limits impacts of vehicles by meeting two goals: limiting the area of vehicle use to formal road corridors, and limiting particularly damaging behaviors of use, including entering the saltmarsh when conditions are wet, traveling more than 10 km per hour, and using traction equipment. Results demonstrated substantial impacts. Tire tracks were present in 66\% of quadrats sampled, and were distributed across the length and breadth of the saltmarsh, covering 17\% (approximately 207 ha) of the 1225 ha saltmarsh. About a third of these quadrats had track covers of 11-50\%. Furthermore, particularly damaging vehicle use behaviors were widely evidenced, including deeply rutted mud, water channel initiation, and substantial loss and fragmentation of vegetation communities. Vehicle use is clearly eroding at least some of the cultural, ecological, and/or mahinga kai values for which the saltmarsh was conserved. While there are many indirect and direct measures for improving the current management strategy, none is likely to result in substantial reductions in vehicle impacts given the low resistance and resilience of saltmarshes to trampling. An alternative strategy that would lead to substantial reductions, and eventual recovery of the saltmarsh, would be to allow existing recreational activities, but deny vehicle entry.",drone; management; ORV impacts; recreation ecology; salt marsh; vehicle impacts,2022,42,1,10.3375/20-50,0885-8608,15,108,292,2009,6,NA,250,5,No,275,225,yes,no,yes

Thus, this species' conservation could be greatly improved via species distribution models, making it a model organism for studying sampling bias. In an attempt to refine a state-derived distribution model for ginseng in Virginia, we conducted additional surveys in a biologically diverse yet under-sampled region of the state-the Cumberland Mountains-thereby increasing the number of documented ginseng occurrences in this region thirteen-fold (N-1 = 16, N-2 = 214). Our surveys resulted in the model predicting an increased probability of American ginseng occurrence not only statewide (mu(1) = 0.099, mu(2) = 0.104) but particularly so in the Cumberland Mountains (mu(1) = 0.170, mu(2) = 0.278), highlighting a consistently overlooked hotspot for biodiversity in Southern Appalachia.

NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL,Long-term Monitoring and Management of American Chaffseed (Schwalbea americana) in the New Jersey Pine Barrens: Population Ecology of an Endangered Hemiparasite,"We studied the long-term demographic structure of the endangered hemiparasitic plant, Schwalbea americana (American chaffseed), in the New Jersey Pine Barrens from 1991 to 2020 in order to address important questions about its population biology, life history, and responses to management. These included the relative contributions of dormancy, recruitment, and other life stages to annual population changes, as well as its ecological responses to fire, mowing, and other factors over time. Following baseline surveys in 1991, we conducted annual censuses from 1993 to 2020 and individualistic plant monitoring from 1999 to 2020. The Schwalbea population initially exhibited positive growth, with major increases observed in the early 2000s, followed by steady, long-term declines. We used generalized linear models and mixed effects models to analyze the relationships between demographic and environmental variables at the population and individual levels, respectively. Dormant season prescribed burning and mowing yielded significant increases in flowering, stems, and survival, with apparent residual benefits in subsequent years following repeated treatments. Germination declined to 0\% after 4 y in seed viability experiments, and recruitment was more strongly correlated with estimated seed bank sizes than with flowering alone. Dormant plants represented an average of 21\% of the total population, with 20\% of above ground plants entering dormancy annually. Most dormancy events (92\%) were 1-3 y in duration, indicating that mortality cannot be distinguished from dormancy for a minimum of 3 y after disappearance. Annual survivorship was high (mean = 88\%), with 9\% of individuals surviving 18 y on average, but differed significantly by cohort and increased with management. Significant differences were observed in size and flowering by age/stage class. However, size alone was insufficient to identify Schwalbea recruits from older plants, due to overlap of their lower size ranges. Long-term declines in survival and recruitment persisted despite suppression of woody succession by hand clipping and intermittent mowing and burning. Increased frequency of mowing or burning may be needed to sustain this population in the future. The relationships of growth and vital rates to other factors are provided, and the benefits of individualistic data for informing Schwalbea monitoring and management are discussed.",dormancy; fire; individualistic studies; mowing; prescribed burning; rare plant conservation,2022,42,2,10.3375/21-33,0885-8608,21,160,350,2430,6,NA,250,5,No,275,225,yes,no,yes

While effects of individual management events (especially fire and grazing) are understood relatively well, their combined, long-term effects are more difficult to predict. We examined how a large (283 ha) tallgrass prairie remnant in Texas responded to changes in management. Previously, the site had been hayed annually for similar to 100 y. In 1987, management changed to prescribed fire in multiple seasons (average fire return interval of 3.5 y) and occasional grazing and haying. From 1996 through 2020, native species richness increased from 39 +/- 3 to 47 +/- 1 species on slopes and from 33 +/- 5 to 44 +/- 4 species on summits (mean +/- standard error, 7.5 m(2) sample area). The number of specialist species (coefficient of conservatism >= 7) remained stable (slopes: 7 +/- 0.4 to 10 +/- 1; summits: 5 +/- 1 to 8 +/- 1). Forb cover increased dramatically (slopes: 44 +/- 3\% to 66 +/- 5\%; summits: 39 +/- 7\% to 65 +/- 6\%). While overall graminoid cover remained similar, cool-season graminoid cover increased (slopes: 4 +/- 2\% to 14 +/- 2\%; summits: 12 +/- 9\% to 18 +/- 2\%) and warm-season graminoid cover decreased (slopes: 49 +/- 4\% to 35 +/- 3\%; summits: 30 +/- 6\% to 26 +/- 3\%). Tree and shrub cover remained low (<3\%). The site's large size and the repeated use of prescribed fire likely contributed to these outcomes. Because fire seasonality can favor either grasses or forbs, burning in multiple seasons can increase forb cover and diversity while still maintaining grass cover.

Seedlings (stem dbh < 2.5 cm, stump at 15 cm < 3.0 cm), saplings (stem dbh > 2.5-10 cm, stump at 15 cm > 3.0-11 cm), and trees (stem dbh > 10 cm, stump at 15 cm > 11 cm) were surveyed in 65 permanent 10 m X 10 m plots: 6 y after fencing placement to exclude white-tailed deer and 5 mo after the start of beaver felling. Overall seedling abundance increased by 5\% while sapling populations grew by 20\% and the number of trees expanded by 34\% after white-tailed deer exclusion. Red maple (Ater rubrum) seedlings, tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) seedlings, and red oak (Quercus rubra) saplings increased significantly while pignut hickory (Carya glabra) and white ash (Fraxinus americana) seedlings decreased significantly. Seedling and tree losses to North American beaver felling were small (<2\% for all seedlings and <3\% for all trees). However, beaver felling caused a greater than 60\% loss of saplings for red maple, black cherry (Prunus serotina), white oak (Quercus alba), and red oak. Less than 30\% of the saplings were lost for pignut hickory, white ash, and tulip poplar. Urban North American beaver preferences for native species saplings paralleled rural beaver in the eastern United States.

NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL,Pollinator Abundance and Diversity under Differing Wet Prairie Management,"Pollinator species have seen recent declines in abundance, generating conservation concern as well as alarm about the ecosystem services they provide. A common approach to alleviate pollinator decline is through habitat management, including restoration of degraded habitats and removal of invasive species, but apparent habitat improvement does not necessarily mean an improvement in pollinator abundance and diversity. We collected pollinators in colored pan traps at three sites at the Lacamas Prairie Natural Area, Washington: remnant wet prairie, restored wet prairie, and an area invaded by reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea). We used model selection to assess whether site and trap color explained variation in pollinator abundance, richness, and diversity. Pollinator abundance was similar at the native and restored sites with predicted averages of 9.06 (7.15, 11.48) and 9.51 (7.52, 12.03), respectively while a heavily invaded reed canary grass site had a significantly lower predicted mean of 7.26 (5.69, 9.26). Site was not included in the top model for species richness or diversity. All three measures varied with trap color. Habitat restoration and invasive species control at Lacamas Prairie appear to have benefited local pollinator populations, but evidence for differences in pollinator richness and diversity was weak. Further work, both characterizing the response of pollinator communities to wet prairie restoration and optimizing trap colors for monitoring in this area, is warranted.",invasive species; pollinators; prairie restoration,2022,42,4,10.3375/22-13,0885-8608,9,73,220,1515,3,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
NATURE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Chromosomal inversion polymorphisms shape the genomic landscape of deer mice,"Chromosomal inversions are an important form of structural variation that can affect recombination, chromosome structure and fitness. However, because inversions can be challenging to detect, the prevalence and hence the significance of inversions segregating within species remains largely unknown, especially in natural populations of mammals. Here, by combining population-genomic and long-read sequencing analyses in a single, widespread species of deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), we identified 21 polymorphic inversions that are large (1.5-43.8 Mb) and cause near-complete suppression of recombination when heterozygous (0-0.03 cM Mb(-1)). We found that inversion breakpoints frequently occur in centromeric and telomeric regions and are often flanked by long inverted repeats (0.5-50 kb), suggesting that they probably arose via ectopic recombination. By genotyping inversions in populations across the species' range, we found that the inversions are often widespread and do not harbour deleterious mutational loads, and many are likely to be maintained as polymorphisms by divergent selection. Comparisons of forest and prairie ecotypes of deer mice revealed 13 inversions that contribute to differentiation between populations, of which five exhibit significant associations with traits implicated in local adaptation. Taken together, these results show that inversion polymorphisms have a significant impact on recombination, genome structure and genetic diversity in deer mice and likely facilitate local adaptation across the widespread range of this species. The identification of 21 large inversion polymorphisms in populations of deer mice shows that they are widespread, important for patterns of recombination and likely to be involved in local adaptation.",NA,2022,6,12,10.1038/s41559-022-01890-0,2397-334X,10,76,244,1778,NA,NA,200,NA,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
NATURE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Evidence for the cooking of fish 780,000 years ago at Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, Israel","Although cooking is regarded as a key element in the evolutionary success of the genus Homo, impacting various biological and social aspects, when intentional cooking first began remains unknown. The early Middle Pleistocene site of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, Israel (marine isotope stages 18-20; similar to 0.78 million years ago), has preserved evidence of hearth-related hominin activities and large numbers of freshwater fish remains (>40,000). A taphonomic study and isotopic analyses revealed significant differences between the characteristics of the fish bone assemblages recovered in eight sequential archaeological horizons of Area B (Layer II-6 levels 1-7) and natural fish bone assemblages (identified in Area A). Gesher Benot Ya'aqov archaeological horizons II-6 L1-7 exhibited low fish species richness, with a clear preference for two species of large Cyprinidae (Luciobarbus longiceps and Carasobarbus canis) and the almost total absence of fish bones in contrast to the richness of pharyngeal teeth (>95\%). Most of the pharyngeal teeth recovered in archaeological horizons II-6 L1-7 were spatially associated with `phantom' hearths (clusters of burnt flint microartifacts). Size-strain analysis using X-ray powder diffraction provided evidence that these teeth had been exposed to low temperature (<500 degrees C), suggesting, together with the archaeological and taphonomic data, that the fish from the archaeological horizons of Area B had been cooked and consumed on site. This is the earliest evidence of cooking by hominins. Taphonomic and stable isotopic analysis of fish bone assemblages at the early Middle Pleistocene site of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov in Israel suggest that fish were cooked before consumption by hominins.",NA,2022,6,12,10.1038/s41559-022-01910-z,2397-334X,14,82,253,1740,NA,NA,200,NA,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
NATURE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,An ancestral Wnt-Brachyury feedback loop in axial patterning and recruitment of mesoderm-determining target genes,"Transcription factors are crucial drivers of cellular differentiation during animal development and often share ancient evolutionary origins. The T-box transcription factor Brachyury plays a pivotal role as an early mesoderm determinant and neural repressor in vertebrates; yet, the ancestral function and key evolutionary transitions of the role of this transcription factor remain obscure. Here, we present a genome-wide target-gene screen using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, an early branching non-bilaterian, and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, a representative of the sister lineage of chordates. Our analysis reveals an ancestral gene regulatory feedback loop connecting Brachyury, FoxA and canonical Wnt signalling involved in axial patterning that predates the cnidarian-bilaterian split about 700 million years ago. Surprisingly, we also found that part of the gene regulatory network controlling the fate of neuromesodermal progenitors in vertebrates was already present in the common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians. However, while several endodermal and neuronal Brachyury target genes are ancestrally shared, hardly any of the key mesodermal downstream targets in vertebrates are found in the sea anemone or the sea urchin. Our study suggests that a limited number of target genes involved in mesoderm formation were newly acquired in the vertebrate lineage, leading to a dramatic shift in the function of this ancestral developmental regulator. Brachyury is an early mesoderm determinant and neural repressor in vertebrates. Comparative Brachyury target screens between a sea anemone and a sea urchin reveal an ancestral gene regulatory feedback loop involved in axial patterning, with conserved endodermal and neuronal, but not mesodermal, targets.",NA,2022,6,12,10.1038/s41559-022-01905-w,2397-334X,14,113,257,1838,NA,NA,200,NA,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
NATURE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Ecosystem productivity affected the spatiotemporal disappearance of Neanderthals in Iberia,"Quantifying changing climatic effects on ecosystem productivity and human spatiotemporal distributions during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Iberia, the authors find evidence that the hiatus between Neanderthal and modern human cultural complexes in North Atlantic Iberia and the longer persistence of Neanderthals in southern latitudes had an ecological cause. What role did fluctuations play in biomass availability for secondary consumers in the disappearance of Neanderthals and the survival of modern humans? To answer this, we quantify the effects of stadial and interstadial conditions on ecosystem productivity and human spatiotemporal distribution patterns during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition (50,000-30,000 calibrated years before the present) in Iberia. First, we used summed probability distribution, optimal linear estimation and Bayesian age modelling to reconstruct an updated timescale for the transition. Next, we executed a generalized dynamic vegetation model to estimate the net primary productivity. Finally, we developed a macroecological model validated with present-day observations to calculate herbivore abundance. The results indicate that, in the Eurosiberian region, the disappearance of Neanderthal groups was contemporaneous with a significant decrease in the available biomass for secondary consumers, and the arrival of the first Homo sapiens populations coincided with an increase in herbivore carrying capacity. During stadials, the Mediterranean region had the most stable conditions and the highest biomass of medium and medium-large herbivores. These outcomes support an ecological cause for the hiatus between the Mousterian and Aurignacian technocomplexes in Northern Iberia and the longer persistence of Neanderthals in southern latitudes.",NA,2022,6,11,10.1038/s41559-022-01861-5,2397-334X,10,90,246,1811,NA,NA,200,NA,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
NATURE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Isotopic evidence that aestivation allows malaria mosquitoes to persist through the dry season in the Sahel,"In the Sahel region of West Africa, An. coluzzii mosquitoes appear to survive the dry season locally, but the relative contribution of this subpopulation to the persistence of the species in the Sahel has remained unknown. Here the authors use stable isotope tracking to determine the fraction of mosquitoes that undergo aestivation, a state of dormancy that allows them to persist through the dry season and maintain yearly malaria transmission. Data suggest that the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles coluzzii persists during the dry season in the Sahel through a dormancy mechanism known as aestivation; however, the contribution of aestivation compared with alternative strategies such as migration is unknown. Here we marked larval Anopheles mosquitoes in two Sahelian villages in Mali using deuterium (H-2) to assess the contribution of aestivation to persistence of mosquitoes through the seven-month dry season. After an initial enrichment period, 33\% of An. coluzzii mosquitoes were strongly marked. Seven months following enrichment, multiple analysis methods supported the ongoing presence of marked mosquitoes, compatible with the prediction that the fraction of marked mosquitoes should remain stable throughout the dry season if local aestivation is occurring. The results suggest that aestivation is a major persistence mechanism of An. coluzzii in the Sahel, contributing at least 20\% of the adults at the onset of rains. This persistence strategy could influence mosquito control and malaria elimination campaigns.",NA,2022,6,11,10.1038/s41559-022-01886-w,2397-334X,16,107,226,1533,NA,NA,200,NA,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
NATURE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,The supply of multiple ecosystem services requires biodiversity across spatial scales,"The impact of local biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning is well established, but the role of larger-scale biodiversity dynamics in the delivery of ecosystem services remains poorly understood. Here we address this gap using a comprehensive dataset describing the supply of 16 cultural, regulating and provisioning ecosystem services in 150 European agricultural grassland plots, and detailed multi-scale data on land use and plant diversity. After controlling for land-use and abiotic factors, we show that both plot-level and surrounding plant diversity play an important role in the supply of cultural and aboveground regulating ecosystem services. In contrast, provisioning and belowground regulating ecosystem services are more strongly driven by field-level management and abiotic factors. Structural equation models revealed that surrounding plant diversity promotes ecosystem services both directly, probably by fostering the spill-over of ecosystem service providers from surrounding areas, and indirectly, by maintaining plot-level diversity. By influencing the ecosystem services that local stakeholders prioritized, biodiversity at different scales was also shown to positively influence a wide range of stakeholder groups. These results provide a comprehensive picture of which ecosystem services rely most strongly on biodiversity, and the respective scales of biodiversity that drive these services. This key information is required for the upscaling of biodiversity-ecosystem service relationships, and the informed management of biodiversity within agricultural landscapes. The authors test whether spatial scale (plot, local and landscape) affects the supply of various ecosystem services in grasslands, finding that some services are predicted by plot-level properties while others depend more on landscape-level management.",NA,2022,NA,NA,10.1038/s41559-022-01918-5,2397-334X,11,85,249,1849,NA,NA,200,NA,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
NATURE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,The likely extinction of hundreds of palm species threatens their contributions to people and ecosystems,"Machine learning is used to predict extinction risk for 1,381 palm species, allowing identification of priority regions for palm conservation and cases where substitution with non-threatened species could provide products for human use. Protecting nature's contributions to people requires accelerating extinction risk assessment and better integrating evolutionary, functional and used diversity with conservation planning. Here, we report machine learning extinction risk predictions for 1,381 palm species (Arecaceae), a plant family of high socio-economic and ecological importance. We integrate these predictions with published assessments for 508 species (covering 75\% of all palm species) and we identify top-priority regions for palm conservation on the basis of their proportion of threatened evolutionarily distinct, functionally distinct and used species. Finally, we explore palm use resilience to identify non-threatened species that could potentially serve as substitutes for threatened used species by providing similar products. We estimate that over a thousand palms (56\%) are probably threatened, including 185 species with documented uses. Some regions (New Guinea, Vanuatu and Vietnam) emerge as top ten priorities for conservation only after incorporating machine learning extinction risk predictions. Potential substitutes are identified for 91\% of the threatened used species and regional use resilience increases with total palm richness. However, 16 threatened used species lack potential substitutes and 30 regions lack substitutes for at least one of their threatened used palm species. Overall, we show that hundreds of species of this keystone family face extinction, some of them probably irreplaceable, at least locally. This highlights the need for urgent actions to avoid major repercussions on palm-associated ecosystem processes and human livelihoods in the coming decades.",NA,2022,6,11,10.1038/s41559-022-01858-0,2397-334X,15,104,264,1911,NA,NA,200,NA,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
NATURE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Patterns and consequences of age-linked change in local relatedness in animal societies,"The ultimate payoff of behaviours depends not only on their direct impact on an individual, but also on the impact on their relatives. Local relatedness-the average relatedness of an individual to their social environment-therefore has profound effects on social and life history evolution. Recent work has begun to show that local relatedness has the potential to change systematically over an individual's lifetime, a process called kinship dynamics. However, it is unclear how general these kinship dynamics are, whether they are predictable in real systems and their effects on behaviour and life history evolution. In this study, we combine modelling with data from real systems to explore the extent and impact of kinship dynamics. We use data from seven group-living mammals with diverse social and mating systems to demonstrate not only that kinship dynamics occur in animal systems, but also that the direction and magnitude of kinship dynamics can be accurately predicted using a simple model. We use a theoretical model to demonstrate that kinship dynamics can profoundly affect lifetime patterns of behaviour and can drive sex differences in helping and harming behaviour across the lifespan in social species. Taken together, this work demonstrates that kinship dynamics are likely to be a fundamental dimension of social evolution, especially when considering age-linked changes and sex differences in behaviour and life history. A model of how local relatedness changes with age fits empirical patterns from seven group-living mammal species and reveals that patterns differ between the sexes and the potential behavioural consequences of these changes.",NA,2022,6,11,10.1038/s41559-022-01872-2,2397-334X,12,87,252,1668,NA,NA,200,NA,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
NATURE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Implications of zero-deforestation palm oil for tropical grassy and dry forest biodiversity,"Modelling reveals large swathes of land in tropical grassy and dry forest biomes that are climatically suitable for commercial plantations of oil palm and would comply with current zero-deforestation commitments, but where conversion to oil palm would, in many locations, cause loss of habitat and biodiversity. Many companies have made zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs) to reduce carbon emissions and biodiversity losses linked to tropical commodities. However, ZDCs conserve areas primarily based on tree cover and aboveground carbon, potentially leading to the unintended consequence that agricultural expansion could be encouraged in biomes outside tropical rainforest, which also support important biodiversity. We examine locations suitable for zero-deforestation expansion of commercial oil palm, which is increasingly expanding outside the tropical rainforest biome, by generating empirical models of global suitability for rainfed and irrigated oil palm. We find that tropical grassy and dry forest biomes contain >50\% of the total area of land climatically suitable for rainfed oil palm expansion in compliance with ZDCs (following the High Carbon Stock Approach; in locations outside urban areas and cropland), and that irrigation could double the area suitable for expansion in these biomes. Within these biomes, ZDCs fail to protect areas of high vertebrate richness from oil palm expansion. To prevent unintended consequences of ZDCs and minimize the environmental impacts of oil palm expansion, policies and governance for sustainable development and conservation must expand focus from rainforests to all tropical biomes.",NA,2022,NA,NA,10.1038/s41559-022-01941-6,2397-334X,12,91,233,1642,NA,NA,200,NA,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
NATURE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Mapping the planet's critical natural assets,"Sustaining the organisms, ecosystems and processes that underpin human wellbeing is necessary to achieve sustainable development. Here we define critical natural assets as the natural and semi-natural ecosystems that provide 90\% of the total current magnitude of 14 types of nature's contributions to people (NCP), and we map the global locations of these critical natural assets at 2 km resolution. Critical natural assets for maintaining local-scale NCP (12 of the 14 NCP) account for 30\% of total global land area and 24\% of national territorial waters, while 44\% of land area is required to also maintain two global-scale NCP (carbon storage and moisture recycling). These areas overlap substantially with cultural diversity (areas containing 96\% of global languages) and biodiversity (covering area requirements for 73\% of birds and 66\% of mammals). At least 87\% of the world's population live in the areas benefitting from critical natural assets for local-scale NCP, while only 16\% live on the lands containing these assets. Many of the NCP mapped here are left out of international agreements focused on conserving species or mitigating climate change, yet this analysis shows that explicitly prioritizing critical natural assets and the NCP they provide could simultaneously advance development, climate and conservation goals.

In this study, we report for the first time details of the harassment strategy and subsequent cavity usurpation by European Starlings on a breeding pair of Green-barred Woodpeckers (Colaptes melanochloros) in an urban area of central-eastern Argentina. Over one breeding season, the woodpeckers excavated seven cavities, none of which were successful. In six of these reproductive attempts (86\%) we recorded interactions with European Starlings and in five (71\%) the cavity was usurped. On three occasions we recorded a cooperative harassment strategy by a group of European Starlings causing the woodpeckers to abandon the cavity. Our report is especially relevant if we consider the invasive potential of the European Starling worldwide and the frequently limited cavity supply in bird breeding habitats. Therefore, we encourage governmental authorities and environmental NGOs to take measures to control the populations of this aggressive invasive species.",Urban ecosystems; Colaptes melanochloros; Sturnus vulgaris; cavity nesting birds; aggressive behaviors; Argentina,2022,8,1,10.1080/23766808.2022.2145089,NA,18,140,252,1728,6,NA,350,5,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY,Current and future geographic patterns of bird diversity dimensions of the Yucatan Peninsula and their representativeness in natural protected areas,"The deviation of expected relationships between taxonomic (TD), phylogenetic (PD), and functional (FD) diversity may inform about some processes (speciation, extinction, competition, and migration) responsible for current biodiversity patterns. We studied the relationship between different dimensions of bird diversity (TD, PD, and FD) of the Yucatan Peninsula (YP) in a context of future climate change. We used ecological niche models to predict the current and future potential distribution of 257 bird species of the YP and estimate their TD, PD, and FD. We calculated a standardized effect size of PD (SES.PD) and FD (SES.FD) to provide an estimation of phylogenetic and functional diversity, independent from species richness. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the system of PAs comparing the observed diversity values in each PA versus what is expected for a null model. We found a positive correlation between PD and TD, and a negative correlation between FD and TD in the current and future scenarios. Finally, we found that none of the PAs protect more diversity of birds than expected by a null model. Our results suggest that macroevolutionary processes have played an important role in the composition of the current Yucatan Peninsula avian assemblages. Our assessment of the effectiveness of the PAs suggests the need to adopt an integrative approach to biodiversity conservation in the YP.",Birds diversity; climate change; conservation; Yucatan Peninsula,2022,8,1,10.1080/23766808.2022.2087282,NA,20,148,218,1414,4,NA,350,5,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY,Does Bergmann's rule apply in bats? Evidence from two neotropical species,"Bergmann's rule is one of the most vigorously debated ecogeographic patterns but has rarely been examined in Neotropical bats. Herein, I examined Bergmann's rule in Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus along an elevation gradient of 2500 m at both inter- and intraspecific level. I measured 384 specimens from collections belonged to C. perspicillata (89 female, 102 male) and A. lituratus (89 female, 104 male). The size of C. perspicillata increased with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature, whereas A. lituratus showed the converse pattern. For both species, females did not differ between elevation categories, contrary to males that were larger above 1000 m in C. perspicillata, but smaller in A. lituratus. Conformity to Bergmann's rule depends on bat size and sex. Despite C. perspicillata follows the pattern, the explanatory mechanisms still need to be understood. By contrast, A. lituratus follows the converse of Bergmann's rule due to naked and highly vascularized wings that aid thermoregulation in warmer environments. Male size is more sensitive to changes in temperature for both species which may be partially explained by sexual selection. Elevation and temperature are not the only factors related to bat morphology and other mechanisms may explain size in bats.",biogeography; body size; chiroptera; Colombia; environmental gradient,2022,8,1,10.1080/23766808.2022.2075530,NA,11,73,197,1302,5,NA,350,5,No,375,325,no,yes,yes

The call of the species has been previously described, but recently gathered data revealed an unreported acoustic unit that we describe herein. Intraspecific variation within the species call was also updated based on an increased sample size. The call is composed of two types of multipulsed notes: a short note, which is in agreement with the previous description, and a trill note that is emitted in association with the short note. The trill note was likely not reported in the previous description because of the small sample size. Further studies should elucidate the social function of the trill note. Acoustic units somewhat resembling the trill note are shared by a few other Scinax species, but the nomenclatural instability of these calls hamper detailed comparisons.

Our goals were to evaluate individual home range, habitat occupancy and movement patterns where they occur in sympatry in relation to seasonal water-level variation. We tracked five P. palpebrosus and seven P. trigonatus using VHS radio transmitters along the shores of two streams directly influenced by the flooding pulse of the Purus River. Paleosuchus palpebrosus individuals moved greater distances on a daily basis and had larger home ranges than P. trigonatus, and the species had different responses to increases in water levels. Paleosuchus palpebrosus moved into flooded forests, as do their principle prey species. Conversely, larger P. trigonatus individuals usually remained near the main stream, and were relatively sedentary. Intraspecific home-range overlap was higher than interspecific overlap in both species. Thus, habitat occupancy patterns as a function of water-level variation might facilitate coexistence of the two species of dwarf caimans in the same location. This study shows that when living in sympatry under a seasonal flooding regime, Paleosuchus species show a degree of habitat partitioning evidenced by different daily movement rates, home-range sizes and home-range locations.",Amazon; Crocodylia; seasonal flood regime; sympatry; telemetry,2022,8,1,10.1080/23766808.2022.2061292,NA,21,158,200,1413,5,NA,350,5,No,375,325,no,yes,yes

In 2018, paedomorphic and metamorphosed adults, as well as clutches and larvae, were found in a cattle pond at Nahuatzen, Michoacan state, Mexico, similar to 60 km away from the type locality (Tacicuaro). Morphometric comparisons suggested high similarity with the type series of A. amblycephalum, while mitochondrial DNA barcoding (16S and control region) revealed close (but imperfect) matching to a reference sequence. We gathered data on life history and ecology of this population, which could be the only extant relic of A. amblycephalum. Its highly limited distribution and presumably low population density are hallmarks for a high risk of extinction, and alarms on the critical situation of many micro-endemic salamanders of Mexico, hence calling for immediate conservation actions.",Axolotl; diversity; endemism; extinction; michoacan; genetic barcoding,2022,8,1,10.1080/23766808.2022.2029323,NA,18,141,152,1039,6,NA,350,5,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY,How do assemblages of epigeal Araneae and Coleoptera respond to changes in habitat structure caused by sugar cane crops in Northern Argentina?,"In Northwest Argentina, nothing is known about the relationship of Araneae and Coleoptera with sugar cane crops. Using pitfall traps in three continuous native forest sites (N) and three native forest windbreaks surrounded by sugar cane crops (W) in the province of Salta, we assessed a)- whether the native diversity of epigeal Araneae and Coleoptera in the Chaco Serrano forest changes as a result of the fragmentation of the habitat caused by the sugar cane plots, and b)- whether the diversity of predatory species increases in native forest windbreaks as a consequence of the contribution of species that come from crops. In the spring of 2006 and the summer of 2007, we collected 599 Araneae and 555 Coleoptera, with community W (S = 132, N = 535) containing much more species but fewer individuals than community N (S = 111, N = 619). We found that the spatial and phenological patterns of the alpha and beta diversities of N were altered in W communities. Thus, habitat fragmentation generated by sugar cane plots led to the local extinction of native Araneae and Coleoptera species. The abundance of generalist Araneae and herbivorous Coleoptera increased in W habitats, but the coprophagous and detritivorous beetles decreased. The diversity of predatory species (Araneae and some Coleoptera) increased in W habitats, although their abundance declined relative to N habitats. Species turnover determined beta diversity between N and W sites; however, between the W sites, nestedness increased and spiders showed a greater loss of species. The spatial heterogeneity between sites, seasons, and habitats had a substantial effect on the composition of the Araneae and Coleoptera assemblages, hence influencing regional diversity. Eight species were habitat indicators, particularly Leprolochus birabeni (Zodariidae), which responds unfavourably to perturbations in the agricultural landscape, and could be deployed as environmental monitors in the Chaco Serrano.",Salta province; agricultural disturbance; alpha diversity; beta diversity,2022,8,1,10.1080/23766808.2022.2131311,NA,22,142,302,1969,4,NA,350,5,No,375,325,no,yes,yes

Despite the international significance of the biosphere reserve and detailed documentation of its terrestrial fauna and flora, the fish fauna in its streams remains relatively unknown, with 48 species previously recorded. We sampled 35 sites within the biosphere reserve over five years (2007-2011) to assess the richness of its ichthyofauna. These surveys yielded a new total of 105 known species for the biosphere reserve, including two newly-recorded orders, Gymnotiformes and Cyprinodontiformes, and 14 newly-recorded families. Fish community composition resembled that of previously-reported fish communities from the Paraguay River drainage, with characiforms and siluriforms comprising the majority of the species (57.1\% and 31.4\%, respectively). Post hoc analyses showed significantly greater ichthyofaunal diversity at sites within the Mbaracayu Forest Nature Reserve, a core protected forest area within the biosphere reserve, compared to areas outside the nature reserve, suggesting a negative impact from deforestation and land conversion on fish assemblages in these headwater streams.

NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY,Influence of predator density in foraging behavior and microhabitat choice on litter-dwelling scorpions,"The presence of a predator can cause behavioral changes in its prey, such as decreased foraging activity. Previous studies have indicated that the scorpion Ananteris mauryi has the ability to identify the chemical traces of its intraguild predator Tityus pusillus, causing it to reduce its exploratory activity. In this study, the foraging activities of A. mauryi in a natural environment with different densities of T. pusillus were compared. The study was carried out through active searches from 19:00 to 22:00 in five fragments of the Atlantic Forest in Pernambuco, Brazil, one having a low density of T. pusillus and four returning high densities. In total, 81 individuals of A. mauryi were observed, and 49.4\% were recorded in the area with a low density of T. pusillus. In general, A. mauryi individuals exhibited a similar foraging activity in the fragment with low and higher density of T. pusillus. Similarly, A. mauryi was found on leaf litter bottom layers independently of T. pusillus density.

NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY,"Integrating biochemical and behavioral approaches to develop a bait to manage the invasive yellow paper wasp Polistes versicolor (Hymenoptera, Vespidae) in the Galapagos Islands","It is estimated that more than 500 species of insects have been introduced to the Galapagos Islands via human activities. One of these insect invaders is the yellow paper wasp, Polistes versicolor (Olivier) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), a social wasp native to continental South America. In Galapagos, these wasps are voracious predators of insect larvae, compete with native species for insect prey or for floral resources and are a human nuisance. Wasp suppression methods currently in use are inefficient and attract non-target species, calling for the development of species-specific attractants that can be used in baits to lure and kill wasps. To evaluate the potential for using wasp semiochemicals in baits, we determined the biochemical composition of the head, thorax, Dufour's and venom glands of P. versicolor foragers via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Male and female wasps were tested for behavioral responses to body segment extracts from both sexes. Female body extracts consistently elicited more behavioral responses in both male and female wasps than male extracts. Females reacted to female head, thorax and abdomen (the Dufour's and venom glands are located in the abdomen) extracts, whereas males reacted significantly to female head and thorax extracts. One male body extract, the head, elicited two significant behaviors: female wasps groomed more often, and males touched the filter paper more often compared to the blank control. Head extracts consistently changed the behavior of female and male wasps and, together with female thorax extracts, have potential as species-specific lures for yellow paper wasps. Heads were mainly composed of hydrocarbon lipids and oleamide, a ligand for odorant-binding proteins. The thorax consisted of fatty aldehydes, long-chain alkanes and fatty amide lipids. Field trials of blends of these compounds in high wasp density areas of Galapagos are the next step to confirm if any of these compounds are attractive to P. versicolor.

We evaluated the composition of littoral macrobenthos and how it is affected by the physicochemical conditions of the water in El Pane reservoir (Peru), located at 4,550 m.a.s.l. Samples were taken between November 2017 and October 2018 from three zones in the reservoir: low (downstream), middle and high (upstream); two of these zones with fish farms (low and middle) and one zone without fish farms (high). The following physicochemical parameters of the water were measured: dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH and temperature. The macrobenthic community was analysed through diversity indices such as Shannon-Wiener (H'), Simpson's dominance index (D), Pielou's evenness (J'), true diversity (D-1), and richness (S). The influence of the physicochemical variables on the macrobenthos was estimated by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Dissolved oxygen was found to have lower values (<0.5 mg/l) than specified in the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS). Macroinvertebrate richness for the whole reservoir was 17 families, and the family with highest relative abundance was Chironomidae (42.24\% in the low zone, 51\% in the middle zone and 40.43\% in the high zone).

NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY,Macroinvertebrates' response to different land use in lowland streams from Uruguay: use of artificial substrates for biomonitoring,"The use of macroinvertebrates as indicators of water quality is an effective and low-cost tool, which is widely implemented in biomonitoring programmes. Certain taxa are characteristic of impaired watercourses (e.g. Oligochaeta, Chironomidae and Amphipoda), while others are characteristic of good-quality watercourses (e.g. Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera; EPT). In this work, we evaluated the response of the macroinvertebrate assemblages to different land uses. For this purpose, artificial substrate colonization experiments were conducted in streams including urban (U, n = 3), intensive agriculture and dairy production (AD, n = 4) and extensive cattle ranching (CR, n = 4) land uses. Because in Uruguay pristine ecosystems are practically non-existent and streams of low order streams associated with extensive cattle production represent the lowest deterioration water quality condition, CR sites were used as control reference streams. Physicochemical water parameters were measured. For macroinvertebrate sampling, 10 artificial substrates were installed in each stream. A total of 110 artificial substrates were analysed. Each sample/site consisted of a plastic mesh bag of 1.2 cm opening, which were filled with 160 cm(3) (including 73.3 +/- 5.8 cm(3) interstitial water) of stones sieved between 1.3 and 1.5 cm. During the summer of 2018 (February), devices were left in streams for 15 days for communities to colonize them. U and AD land use represented the stressors with the highest impact on the attributes and composition of the macroinvertebrate communities. Abundance of EPT was higher in CR, meanwhile Caenogastropoda dominated in AD, and Amphipoda in U sites. Macroinvertebrate groups to order level classification were able to effectively discriminate between different land uses. The use of artificial substrate also demonstrated to be efficient method for monitoring macroinvertebrate community. We did not find a correlation between the physicochemical water parameters and the macroinvertebrate community. In this context, we propose a rapid and cost-effective biomonitoring approach, capable of estimating the degree of impact of different land uses.",Lowland streams; taxonomic resolution; EPT; Hyalellidae; Cochliopidae,2022,8,1,10.1080/23766808.2022.2049178,NA,17,130,313,2188,5,NA,350,5,No,375,325,no,yes,yes

Here we report the discovery and collection of what is likely a naturally deposited partial South Island giant moa (Dinornis robustus) skeleton from West Ruggedy Beach, Rakiura, radiocarbon dated to 1297-1395 CE (95.4\% CI). The time of death of this moa overlaps with the early occupation of the island by Maori. However, the discovery of this moa skeleton in a dune environment with the presence of an organic rich layer beneath the skeleton, associated gizzard stones, and an absence of archaeological material/ features or any cut marks on the bones indicating a cultural association, suggests this individual likely represents a natural subfossil deposit.

Stoat control for whio in the South Island has focused on valley floor trapping along waterway margins but increasing survival and productivity for whio using this method is complicated by irruptive predator dynamics caused by occasional masting of beech species (Nothofagaceae). We investigated the effect of integrating stoat trapping with pulsed aerial 1080 toxin operations to counter predator irruptions on whio survival and productivity in c. 40 000 ha of beech dominated Kahurangi National Park. We collected data on adult female whio survival, probability of breeding, nesting success, and duckling survival for seven years through two full beech mast events. We found a positive relationship between distance into the interior of the treatment block and whio population growth, nesting success, duckling, and adult survival. Heavy female whio were more likely to breed than light ones, and adult female survival was higher during the breeding season than during non-breeding. Nesting success was greatest in the breeding season following a 1080 operation. Duckling survival was higher at lower river flows. Positive population growth was only predicted near the centre of the study area (c. 13 km from the edge) with both traps and 1080. We conclude that in the centre of treatment blocks at least as large as our study block, integrated pest control should be enough to ensure long-term population persistence of whio in a beech-dominated system.",1080; blue duck; Kahurangi National Park; New Zealand; radio tracking; riverine duck; traps,2022,46,1,10.20417/nzjecol.46.17,0110-6465,21,172,250,1635,7,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Sounding out the nest: Unobtrusive localisation of North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) incubation burrows,"Monitoring breeding outcomes of cryptic nocturnal species such as the North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) is an important aim for conservation management in New Zealand. While fitting male kiwi with radio transmitters enables incubation burrows to be found and monitored, it is invasive and expensive. Remote monitoring methods (without handling of birds) are preferable. Here we investigate the extent to which it is practical to find North Island brown kiwi incubation burrows based on remote monitoring, motivated by anecdotal reports that incubating males call close to their incubation burrow on first emergence. We test this observation, and then use it to demonstrate how a combination of acoustic recorders, human listening, and trail cameras can be deployed to locate the burrow with minimal disturbance, based on the male's first call of the night. Our analysis of an incubating brown kiwi male's first call in the evening as a function of distance from the burrow shows that for more than half the time monitored he called within 10 minutes of leaving his burrow and that on these nights, he was usually less than 35 m from it. Along with backtracking of kiwi footsteps, this enables the localisation of the burrow. We outline a workflow for the method based on our experience and discuss how it can be made more efficient and usable in the future. Our method facilitates the finding of nests, and hence of chicks, without the need for adult kiwi to be fitted with transmitters.",acoustic; incubation; localisation; monitoring; North Island brown kiwi,2022,46,1,10.20417/nzjecol.46.19,0110-6465,15,112,246,1496,5,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

We used the isotopic composition of experimentally-induced feathers to investigate the foraging locations of the Hutton's shearwater (Puffinus huttoni), an endangered seabird that is a breeding endemic to the Kaikoura region of New Zealand. The isotopic composition of feathers was first compared with potential prey items collected from the near-shore marine environment near the breeding colony. By applying trophic fractionation factors (2-4 parts per thousand increase in delta N-15 for every 1 \% increase in delta C-13) and comparing the isotopic composition of the induced tail feathers and sampled prey items, we found that feather isotopic compositions were not consistent with a diet based on feeding locally. Both the delta C-13 and delta N-15 from zooplankton and fish collected within 8 km of Kaikoura were significantly different than the isotopic composition of induced feathers and were outside of the range expected for consumed local prey items. Instead, we found the isotopic composition of Hutton's shearwater feathers was more consistent with feeding on potential prey items in the seas north-east and around Banks Peninsula, an area c. 100 km south of the breeding colony and where they had been tracked previously. Stable isotope analysis can provide insight into the foraging behaviour of birds at sea and demonstrates the importance of isotopic research in pinpointing foraging locations in seabirds with large geographic ranges.",New Zealand; seabird; diet; feather composition; tracking,2022,46,1,10.20417/nzjecol.46.5,0110-6465,14,106,247,1620,5,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Genetic diversity and differentiation in the leaf litter weevil Geochus politus across an urban-rural gradient,"Urban reserves have the potential to retain relatively high biodiversity. However, populations of the taxa within them can have reduced genetic diversity and, if gene flow between populations is inhibited by urbanised surroundings, can become genetically differentiated. Here we determine whether differences in population genetic differentiation and diversity can be observed in the leaf litter inhabiting weevil Geochus politus along the urban-rural gradient spanning Waitakere Ranges Regional Parkland and suburbs of West Auckland, New Zealand. Nine microsatellite markers were developed and screened across 300 individuals from nine sampling locations. Pairwise FST values, a principal coordinates analysis, and Bayesian estimates of population structure all demonstrated that the most urban site was strongly differentiated from the others. This site also had the lowest heterozygosity and highest FIS values, potentially indicating a loss of genetic variation and a greater degree of inbreeding, although not to a dramatic extent. Differentiation was also observed among sampling locations within continuous forest, suggesting that both urbanisation and other landscape variables are influencing gene flow between these locations. This study highlights the potential for urban reserves to harbour significant diversity and emphasises the importance of maintaining these sites.",gene flow; genetic diversity; population structure; urban reserves,2022,46,1,10.20417/nzjecol.46.6,0110-6465,15,110,190,1382,4,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Understanding farmer behaviour: A psychological approach to encouraging pro-biodiversity actions on-farm,"Understanding farmer behaviour and drivers for behaviour change will be the key to bringing about practice change, such as increasing management and enhancement of native biodiversity on-farm. Farmer participation in biodiversity protection and management is a critical challenge for both national conservation outcomes and achieving more sustainable farm systems. Enhancing native biodiversity provides a mechanism for increasing the sustainability of food and fibre production, mitigation of environmental emissions, and enhancing the resilience of farm systems to weather events and the impacts of climate change. We surveyed 500 sheep and beef farmers throughout New Zealand using a survey explicitly based on the dominant psychological model of volitional behaviour, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Farmers' attitudes, perception of social norms, control beliefs, moral obligation, and perceived private-public benefit, regarding the protection and management of native biodiversity on-farm, were investigated. We used a combination of descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and TPB regression modelling of the survey data to understand past pro-biodiversity behaviour and future intentions to implement pro-biodiversity behaviours on-farm. We found that sheep and beef farmers saw (1) greater public than private benefit resulting from the protection and management of native biodiversity on-farm; (2) belief in the efficacy of specific biodiversity behaviours has a stronger relationship with actual behaviour than intentional behaviour; and (3) planning for pro-biodiversity behaviours, such as in a farm planning process, increases farmer pro-biodiversity behaviour. We conclude there is a need to increase farmer understanding of pro-biodiversity practices and outcomes for both farmer private and public benefit and the removal and dissolution of perceived barriers and constraints preventing more pro-biodiversity behaviour on-farm. Based on this research, we recommend that policy initiatives should be targeted at (1) illustrating and communicating the multiple values of native biodiversity to farm systems and farming enterprises (private benefit), and to ecosystem function and New Zealand's conservation objectives as a whole (public benefit); (2) the specific areas operating as behavioural controls on pro-biodiversity behaviour, and (3) integrating native biodiversity considerations into farm planning processes.",behaviour change; policy interventions; pro-biodiversity behaviour; public-private benefit; theory of planned behaviour,2022,46,1,10.20417/nzjecol.46.20,0110-6465,11,104,331,2448,5,15,300,10,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Toxin-laced rat carcass baits for stoat elimination,"Stoats are implicated in the severe decline of certain iconic endemic species in New Zealand. Stoats are notoriously difficult to control, as they are highly cryptic and often neophobic around control techniques such as traps and poison baits in tunnels. Stoats are often killed through secondary poisoning in both aerial and hand-lay operations targeting other mammalian pests. We prototype trialled a novel approach to poisoning of stoats: wild-caught ship rats that had consumed (and subsequently died from) a lethal dose of 1080 cereal baits in a captive facility. Stoats in the treatment area were targeted at food-lured (egg mayonnaise) camera trap sites that had multiple stoat visitations prior to baiting with toxic rat carcasses. Stoats were recorded taking toxic rat carcass baits from 7 out of 15 hand-laid sites. No other species were observed taking toxic rat carcasses during the study. The number of cameras in the treatment area that detected stoats was significantly reduced for 30 days after toxic baiting. There was no significant difference in number of cameras that detected stoats during this period in the non-treatment area. These results suggest that 94\% of the stoats in the treatment area were poisoned using toxin-laced rat carcasses within one week of baiting. Toxic rat carcass baits placed at locations of known stoat activity may be a highly successful method of eliminating individual stoats at very low density.",1080; camera traps; sodium fluoroacetate; stoats; wildlife management,2022,46,1,10.20417/nzjecol.46.2,0110-6465,7,51,228,1447,5,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Spatial patterns and habitat use of penned and hard-released arboreal geckos translocated to an offshore island free of introduced mammals,"Temporary penning prior to release is a strategy increasingly being used in lizard translocations to improve site fidelity and increase chances of translocation success. However, it is yet to be tested on a range of lizard taxa. Between 2015 and 2018, 49 individuals of a New Zealand endemic arboreal gecko species (ngahere gecko, Mokopirirakau ``southern North Island{''}) were translocated to mammal-free Mana Island near Wellington as mitigation for a development project. Twenty-five of these geckos were tracked for this study with geckos being either hard-released (n = 9) or released into a 0.52 ha pen for 10-31 months (n = 16). Using radio-telemetry, we compared the behaviour, habitat use, dispersal, and home ranges of geckos from both groups in the weeks immediately following removal of the pen. Hard-released geckos travelled further from their initial release point and between location fixes than penned geckos. Hard-released geckos also had a larger home range size than penned geckos using both minimum convex polygons and fixed kernel methods, albeit with significant variation among individuals within each group. Habitat use was similar in both groups, but only hard-released geckos used grass, which was unexpected due to the arboreal nature of the species. In conclusion, our results support the use of penned-releases for translocations of arboreal geckos to restrict initial post-translocation dispersal and aid population establishment.",lizard; mitigation; Mokopirirakau; penning; radio-tracking; soft-release; translocation,2022,46,2,10.20417/nzjecol.46.27,0110-6465,20,138,220,1462,7,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"Do mice matter? Impacts of house mice alone on invertebrates, seedlings and fungi at Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari","The advent of mammal-resistant fences has allowed multi-species eradications of mammals from ecosanctuaries on the New Zealand mainland. However, maintaining eradication of house mice (Mus musculus) has proven difficult, and at some fenced reserves they are the only exotic mammal present and reach a high population density. Over 5 years we examined the impacts of mice alone on biodiversity at Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari by comparing forest blocks with relatively high and low numbers of mice. We managed two independently fenced sites within the sanctuary to achieve high mouse numbers (up to 46 per hectare) at one site and undetectable mouse numbers at the second site. We then reversed these treatments by eradicating mice from the first site and allowing their numbers to increase at the second. We found strong evidence that mice reduced the abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrates, in particular caterpillars, spiders, weta, and beetles, and reduced the mean body size of some taxa. In addition, earthworm abundance, biomass and species richness increased with a decreasing mouse population in one study block. No significant impact of mice on land snails, seedlings or fungi was detected at Maungatautari. Overall, there is substantial biodiversity gain from eradicating the full suite of pest mammals other than mice. However, mice may be catastrophic in ecosanctuaries that focus on the recovery of invertebrates or lizards. We expect that mouse control tools will steadily improve so that in the future mice can be eradicated and excluded from forest reserves such as Maungatautari.",earthworms; ecosanctuary; invertebrates; Mus musculus; New Zealand; seedlings; weta,2022,46,1,10.20417/nzjecol.46.22,0110-6465,17,117,246,1604,7,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,A risk to the forestry industry? Invasive pines as hosts of foliar fungi and potential pathogens,"Pathogen accumulation on an invasive plant species can occur over time, through co-invasion, or adaptation of native pathogen species. While accumulated pathogens can reduce the success and spread of an invasive species, they can also spill-over into native plant communities or valuable non-native populations. Transmission of pathogens may be density-dependent, with dense invasive populations creating better opportunities for pathogen spread than scattered individuals. Some pine species (Pinus) and some other Pinaceae (including Pseudotsuga) are extremely invasive trees in New Zealand but trees in the Pinaceae are also used extensively within the forestry industry. Little is known about the foliar pathogens present on invasive populations and whether they pose a risk to industry. We cultured foliar fungi from needles of Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus contorta found at both low and high densities of invasion. DNA from fungal cultures was extracted and sequenced using Sanger sequencing. We cultured fungi from a greater proportion of P. menziesii than P. contorta needles and a greater proportion of trees from low versus high densities of invasion. The richness of foliar fungi decreased as a function of density and P. menziesii hosted a greater richness of fungi than P. contorta. We observed no change in the richness of pathogens between P. menziesii and P. contorta or between low and high density invasions. However, we did observe a greater proportion of fungi that were potentially pathogenic at high density than at low density. We identified one major widespread pathogen (Nothophaeocryptopus gaeumannii) and a number of opportunistic potential pathogens (i.e. Sydowia polyspora, Lophodermium pinastri and Alternaria alternata), indicating the possibility of spill-over into commercial plantations.",fungi; pathogen spill-over; plant invasion; Pinaceae; wilding conifers,2022,46,1,10.20417/nzjecol.46.13,0110-6465,16,96,267,1823,5,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

The species is widespread through the North and South Islands, except for the regions of Westland, Fiordland, and Southland. However, it is suspected that populations have been declining in recent decades. Our study focused on the California quail population in the Marlborough Sounds along six road sections between Manaroa, Picton, and Havelock during 2010-2019. Analysis of quail counts using a Generalised Linear Model revealed that year (decline from 2010 to 2019), season (highest in spring, lowest in winter and Autumn) and vehicle traffic (highest at low traffic, lowest at high traffic) all showed significant relationships with the mean number of quail counted per survey. Quail numbers also showed significant relationships with time of day (highest in evening, lowest in afternoon) and road section (highest from Portage to Te Mahia and Te Mahia to Linkwater). The decline in quail counted over the 10-year period was possibly due to loss of suitable habitat through forest regeneration, and perhaps also increased predation by certain introduced mammals. We recommend future research to further investigate the causes of the decline, given that confirmed declines in exotic quail populations may have similar implications for native species that also prefer open habitats within the Marlborough Sounds region.",annual abundance; diurnal; Havelock; Manaroa; Picton; road counts; seasonal abundance,2022,46,2,10.20417/nzjecol.46.28,0110-6465,18,142,224,1455,7,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Moths can transfer pollen between flowers under experimental conditions,"To be considered an effective pollinator, a floral visitor must not only be able to remove pollen but also transfer this pollen to a receptive conspecific stigma. While studies of diurnal pollination are commonplace, our understanding of the effectiveness of nocturnal pollinators is limited largely because of the difficulties of doing these studies at night. As a result of this, the way in which moths transfer pollen between flowers has been understudied globally, despite many authors suggesting they could be significant contributors to pollination. Here, we tested whether moths are capable of transferring pollen between flowers under experimental conditions using a fluorescent pollen-tracker powder. A flower-feeding taxon (Noctuidae: Ichneutica plena) and non-feeding taxon (Hepialidae: Wiseana spp.) were contained overnight with flowering shoots of putatively moth-pollinated Leptospermum scoparium and Pimelea prostrata (I. plena only), and putatively bird-pollinated Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora. Moths were able to transfer pollen tracker between flowers for both of the putatively moth-pollinated species, while no pollen tracker was removed from putatively bird-pollinated flowers. Both the feeding and non-feeding moth taxa were able to transfer pollen tracker between flowers; however, the feeding taxon could be considered a more effective pollinator because of the greater proportion of individuals both carrying and transferring pollen tracker compared with the non-feeding taxon. This study provides experimental evidence that moths may contribute to the pollination of L. scoparium and P. prostrata, and suggests a reassessment of the pollination ecology for these species is warranted.",Lepidoptera; Leptospermum; manuka; pollen transfer; pollination; New Zealand; Pimelea,2022,46,1,10.20417/nzjecol.46.7,0110-6465,9,71,240,1709,7,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Comparison of footprint tracking and pitfall trapping for detecting skinks,"Inventory and monitoring of biodiversity requires effective sampling tools. Footprint tracking tunnels, developed in New Zealand to monitor small mammals, may also be useful for sampling lizards and other reptiles but more research is needed to verify this. To that end, we compared the detectability of terrestrial skinks using two methods: pitfall trapping and footprint tracking. In New Zealand, the former is the traditional method for sampling skinks, while the latter is routinely used to monitor populations of introduced rodents and mustelids. In January 2019, we operated paired grids containing 5 x 5 arrays of pitfall traps and standard rodent tracking tunnels on Tiwai Peninsula in Southland, South Island, and compared the daily proportions of traps and tunnels that detected skinks via captures and footprints, respectively. Overall, tracking tunnels were approximately twice as likely to detect skinks as pitfall traps. Additional research is required to: (1) test the relative efficacy of footprint tracking versus conventional detection methods on other lizard and reptile species; (2) investigate alternative tunnel designs and long-life lures; and, (3) calibrate footprint tracking rates against density estimates to assess suitability for monitoring.",detection; monitoring; pitfall trap; reptiles; tracking tunnel; sampling tools,2022,46,2,10.20417/nzjecol.46.24,0110-6465,10,74,185,1270,6,15,300,10,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST,A Preliminary Study of Foraging Habitat Use by Nesting Barn Swallows in Massachusetts,"Hirundo rustica (Barn Swallow) belongs to a suite of aerial insectivores that are showing serious population declines in northeastern North America. Various causes of these declines have been postulated, especially including agricultural intensification, declining insect populations, and/or increased mortality associated with climate changes. In this study, we examined foraging behavior of Barn Swallows nesting in a large breeding colony located in western Massachusetts. Swallows foraged primarily within 1 km of their nesting site. Most of the nearby agricultural areas used by foraging swallows were broadly characterized as pasture/hay or cultivated land uses; we found no significant difference in foraging activity levels between these habitat categories. In addition to the availability of suitable nesting structures, successful conservation of Barn Swallows likely requires that breeding colonies have access to nearby fields which provide foraging opportunities. Further study is needed to clarify specific habitat management that will enhance populations of flying insects preyed upon by swallows and other aerial insectivores.",NA,2022,29,1,NA,1092-6194,13,85,157,1142,NA,20,120,NA,Yes,145,95,yes,no,yes

Commonly, White-Footed Deermice are ecological generalists, and North American Deermice are ecological specialists. In the Inner Bluegrass Region of Kentucky, these 2 species are sympatric in agroecosystems habitats, including the University of Kentucky North Farm. This farm was the most trapped location in central Kentucky from 1950 to 1968, with results indicating the White-Footed Deermoouse was the more common of these species. Trapping from 1995 to 2015 found that North American Deermice were caught rarely. Our study examined agroecosystems habitats at the UK North Farm, including all perennial and annual habitats, to determine the relative abundance and habitat use by both these species. In our study, North American Deermice was the most commonly captured species; it was trapped rarely in perennial habitats but much more frequently in annual crops. Perennial clover fields and Medicago sativa (Alfalfa) were the 2 exceptions; however, these are short crops with exposed soil between rows. Essentially, North American Deermice were observed in the agricultural equivalent of early successional habitat. In contrast, White-Footed Deermice were captured in both perennial and annual habitats, but more commonly in perennial habitats, the exception being annual Salvia hispanica (Chia) fields where dense, green plants produced a thick canopy. Overall, the best predictor of habitat for North American Deermice was bare, exposed soil, whereas the best predictor for White-Footed Deermice was dense growth and overhead cover.",NA,2022,29,2,10.1656/045.029.0205,1092-6194,20,165,257,1793,NA,20,120,NA,Yes,145,95,yes,no,yes
NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST,Community Structure of Terrestrial Vertebrates in a Restored Meadow Habitat in Pennsylvania: Assessing the Potential Prey Base for Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes,"We sampled the vertebrate community of a 20-ha conservation easement in Venango County, PA, from April through August 2021. The restoration and management efforts on this easement were designed to improve the meadow habitat for one of the few remaining populations of Sistrurus catenatus (Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake) in Pennsylvania, and our sampling efforts were focused on evaluating the potential prey base available to the rattlesnakes at this site. We identified 9 amphibian species, 10 reptile species, and 11 small mammal species. For amphibians, Anaxyrus americanus (American Toad) was the most abundant species, accounting for 32.6\% of the total, followed by Notophthalmus viridescens (Red-Spotted Newt) with 30.6\% of total abundance. Thamnophis brachystoma (Short-Headed Gartersnake) comprised more than half (53.7\%) of all reptiles sampled, followed by Thamnophis sirtalis (Eastern Gartersnake; 22.7\%). Peromyscus leucopus (White- Footed Mouse) was the most abundant mammal species, accounting for 37.4\% of all mammals surveyed, followed by Microtus pennsylvanicus (Eastern Meadow Vole; 24.8\%). Mammals had the greatest species richness (S = 11), while reptiles had the greatest total abundance (TA = 361), and amphibians had the greatest species evenness (E = 0.799). Species accounts for Venango County indicate that we sampled 40.9\% (9/22), 37.0\% (10/27), and 21.2\% (11/52) of the known amphibian, reptilian, and mammalian species, respectively, within this restored meadow habitat. Our results suggest that the restoration efforts on this easement study site have been extremely effective in creating meadow habitat that supports a diversity of prey species for the Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake.",NA,2022,29,3,10.1656/045.029.0308,1092-6194,21,162,246,1725,NA,20,120,NA,Yes,145,95,yes,no,yes
NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST,Comparing the Effectiveness of Fitch and Sherman Traps in a Grassland Ecosystem,"Many studies of rodents rely on the use of live trapping. Comparative studies of trap type provide researchers with information that can inform their trapping design, yet relatively few comparative studies include economical mesh traps, such as Fitch traps. I compared the effectivess of Sherman box traps and Fitch mesh traps for rodent sampling in a grassland ecosystem. Between 2016 and 2017, I set 120 trap stations with both Fitch and Sherman traps for a total of 6000 trap nights at a single tallgrass prairie-restoration site in northern Illinois. I compared trap effectivess overall and for each species captured. Fitch traps were significantly better at capturing ground squirrels than Sherman traps and comparable to Sherman traps at capturing voles and jumping mice. These results demonstrate Fitch traps provide a viable alternative to Sherman traps for sampling at this location and indicate they should be considered in future comparative studies to further assess their effectiveness, especially in grasslands.",NA,2022,29,3,10.1656/045.029.0305,1092-6194,12,79,157,1025,NA,20,120,NA,Yes,145,95,yes,no,yes

Constructed living shoreline marshes can serve as successful management solutions when implemented correctly, but studies comparing these created estuarine habitats to their natural marsh counterparts are needed to assess their ecological functionality. We compared adult Palaemonetes pugio (Daggerblade Grass Shrimp) population demographics and diets from 13 pairs of living shoreline and natural marsh sites in the southwestern portion of the Chesapeake Bay. No significant differences were observed in demographics including abundance, weight, length, number of gravid females, and egg abundance and quality. Gut-content analysis detected significantly more terrestrial debris in shrimp from living shorelines, but the omnivorous dietary needs appeared met in all marsh sites. Overall, shrimp populations differed more among site pairs from different shorescape settings than between created and natural marshes from the same settings, suggesting that living shorelines are approaching ecosystem functionality similar to natural marsh habitats. However, the observed negative effect of agricultural land use on shrimp abundance and the discovery of microplastics in gut contents from all sites sampled indicate the need for further consideration of human impacts in both constructed and natural coastal habitats.",NA,2022,29,2,10.1656/045.029.0204,1092-6194,21,145,208,1538,NA,20,120,NA,Yes,145,95,yes,no,yes

We used both field techniques and molecular methods to assess biodiversity in a stream in southwest Virginia. We used emergence traps to collect organisms that emerged from the stream as reproducing adults over a 4-week period and collected environmental samples (e.g., water, sediment) to sequence the DNA found in the samples. Emerging aquatic insect abundance, richness, and diversity increased over time. More family richness was detected using environmental DNA (eDNA) than traditional field sampling; however, many families detected using field techniques were not recovered using eDNA, furthering support that both protocols are necessary for fully documenting biodiversity. We did not have much success in identifying eDNA sequences to species with high sequence similarity, suggesting that invertebrate biodiversity of southwest Virginia is not well-documented in open-source DNA sequence databases. In addition to documenting insect biodiversity, we measured the levels of heavy metals in the stream sediment. Sediment values for cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury and lead were within regulatory limits and were not significantly correlated with biodiversity measures.",NA,2022,29,2,10.1656/045.029.0202,1092-6194,13,103,194,1388,NA,20,120,NA,Yes,145,95,yes,no,yes
NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST,"Dragonfly Biodiversity at Abandoned Work Sites: Dredge-spoil Ponds of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, New Castle County, Delaware","There are few undisturbed, freshwater habitats remaining in the populated areas of the United States. Aquatic organisms, such as dragonflies (Odonata), have therefore either had to adapt to disturbed and modified secondary habitats, such as farms, golf courses, storm-water remediation basins, and community-park ponds, or risk extirpation. The species that readily adapt to these habitats are usually widespread common species. However, other aquatic habitats inadvertently created at abandoned work sites often evolve distinctive characteristics over time that provide refuge for species rarely or never found at deliberately created pond habitats. For 17 years, we have monitored the diverse Odonata fauna at several floristically distinct ponds formed in depressions left from the dredging of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal in the 1960s. Among the species found are ones not known elsewhere locally or ones found in unusual abundance at 1 or more of the ponds, though infrequently encountered regionally.

NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST,Effects of Non-native Shrubs on Caterpillars and Shrubland-Dependent Passerines Within Three Transmission Line Rights-of-Way in Southeastern New Hampshire,"Caterpillars (Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera: Symphyta) are a critical food that breeding passerines use for raising young and serve as an important source of carotenoids that support nestling growth and feather pigmentation. When non-native, invasive plants grow abundant enough to reduce native plant diversity they can cause a reduction in caterpillar abundance. The goal of this study was to determine whether a reduction in caterpillars caused by non-native, invasive shrubs affects nestling health and/or the reproductive success of a shrubland-dependent passerine, Geothlypis trichas trichas (Common Yellowthroat). I first quantified caterpillar abundance on the dominant native and nonnative shrubs comprising Common Yellowthroat territories in shrubby transmission-line rights-of-way and estimated total caterpillar abundance in each territory based on the shrub species composition. I then determined if differences in shrub species composition and caterpillar abundance affected: (1) adult Common Yellowthroat reproductive success, (2) nestling Common Yellowthroat diet composition, or (3) nestling Common Yellowthroat growth rate, plasma carotenoids, and carotenoid-based plumage color. Non-native, invasive shrubs did not reduce caterpillar abundance until they comprised >55\% of the shrub volume and significantly reduced the diversity and abundance of native shrubs in bird territories. Differences in caterpillar abundance among sites did not result in differences in Common Yellowthroat productivity, but where non-native shrubs comprised >= 55\% of the shrub volume, adults increased their frequency of feeding visits to nestlings and fed nestlings the greatest proportion of non-caterpillar prey. Daily surveys of shru-bland bird presence/absence at study sites indicated that most shrubland-dependent bird species were absent where non-native shrubs comprised >= 55\% of the shrub cover; such conditions likely equated to habitat loss for bird species less able than Common Yellowthroats to adapt to low shrub diversity and low caterpillar abundance.",NA,2022,29,NA,10.1656/045.029.m2001,1092-6194,18,154,281,2065,NA,20,120,NA,Yes,145,95,yes,no,yes
NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST,Fishes of Northern New York and the Adirondacks,"Knowledge of the fishes of northern New York can help with conservation planning and landscape interpretations. This report draws from fish surveys from the 1930s to 2018 to summarize and interpret the distribution of fishes in the region surrounding and including the Adirondacks. The study area, with its broad elevational gradient, includes lowland and upland ecoregions, for which we compare fish assemblages. Lowlands are the waters downstream of historic barriers to migration into the uplands (elevations of 62-215 m, depending on landscape slope). Uplands are the waters at higher elevations than the lowlands (above 168 m) that include the transitional and Adirondacks' elevations (above 305 m). In total, 114 fish species and 2 hybrids have been documented in northern New York; for the sake of convenience, the hybrids are tabulated as species here. Of the 116 taxa, 111 are in lowlands. Eighty percent are native to New York State, although patterns of nativity differ between the lowlands and the uplands. Specifically, natives make up 80\% of the lowland group and 51\% of upland group. Many of the species that are native to the lowlands do not occur naturally in the uplands, becoming widespread there only after transferal or stocking. The continued expansion of non-native species has caused changes in fish communities and losses of native species. In the uplands, 3 native species have been lost and 3 others dramatically reduced. In the lowlands, there has been relatively little change in species status over time. Brief annotations are provided for each of the 116 taxa, including summaries of recent studies, changes in their status before and after December 1989, and proposed conservation classifications.",NA,2022,29,NA,NA,1092-6194,8,47,272,1731,NA,20,120,NA,Yes,145,95,yes,no,yes
NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST,Midge Larvae Metriocnemus knabi Can Emigrate to New Pitchers Within Sarracenia purpurea After Pitcher Drainage,"Many experimental aquatic ecologists are familiar with the commonly used model system Sarracenia purpurea (Purple Pitcher Plant), as this plant contains an entire aquatic ecosystem with obligate invertebrates in its pitcher-shaped leaves. An obligate herbivore of the Purple Pitcher Plant, Exyra fax (Pitcher Mining Moth), consumes plant tissue and chews a hole at the base of the pitcher, draining the pitcher of fluid and thereby creating unsuitable habitat for obligate aquatic invertebrates. Historically, it has been noted that the obligate aquatic invertebrate larvae within the Purple Pitcher Plant are incapable of leaving the pitcher they were initially deposited in as eggs. The objective of this experiment was to determine if larvae of the obligate invertebrate Metriocnemus knabi (Pitcher Plant Midge) is capable of emigrating to new pitchers when faced with pitcher drainage as a result of damage from the Pitcher Mining Moth. We placed midge larvae of varying abundances in experimental pitchers that were drained in a way similar to the work of Pitcher Mining Moth larvae. After drainage, larval midges were allowed 2 weeks to emigrate. At the end of 2 weeks, as much as 38.2\% of the initial abundance of M. knabi larvae had emigrated out of drained pitchers to new, viable, fluid-filled pitchers and survived. We present here the first evidence that the obligate Pitcher Plant Midge larvae are capable of emigration when faced with unsuitable habitat.",NA,2022,29,3,10.1656/045.029.0304,1092-6194,15,110,230,1469,NA,20,120,NA,Yes,145,95,yes,no,yes
NORTHWEST SCIENCE,"Hymenopteran Pollinators Prefer Yellow Flowers to Red Ones in Scotch Broom (Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link), but Not Enough to Negatively Affect Plant Fitness","In well-established flowering plant invasions, floral phenotypes that do not attract pollinators are predicted to be eliminated through natural selection. We explored this hypothesis in the invasive plant species Scotch broom ( Cytisus scoparius), which has yellow flowers frequented by a diverse community of bee species, as well as red-tinged flowers that are predicted to be pollinated at a significantly lower rate. We predicted that plants with the red-flower phenotype will have fewer flowers visited, produce fewer seed pods per flower, and produce fewer seeds per pod than the yellow-flowered type. To investigate this, we measured the proportion of flowers pollinated for red- and yellow-flowered phenotypes, observed the number of seed pods produced per flower, and counted seeds per pod. Although we found lower pollination in the red-flowered phenotype, we did not see differences in female fitness. Scotch broom is an invader predicted to be limited in fecundity by the rate of pollinator visits and would be expected to lose phenotypes that attract fewer pollinators. We found the persistence of a less-attractive phenotype, likely because the reduction in male fitness is not paired with a reduction in female fitness.",invasive; pollination; bees; natural selection; Cytisus scoparius,2022,95,3-Apr,10.3955/046.095.0307,0029-344X,23,155,189,1233,5,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
NORTHWEST SCIENCE,Population Characteristics of Brook Trout in Idaho Streams and Alpine Lakes,"In western North America, nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) frequently threaten native salmonids via competition and hybridization, so fisheries managers often implement eradication programs for conservation purposes. In conjunction with such programs, managers often construct population models to evaluate the effects of different management strategies designed to control the undesirable population, but such models require demographic data (e.g., age, growth, sex ratios, and survival), which are lacking for western brook trout populations. Brook trout were sampled from 12 alpine lakes and two streams in Idaho, with total length varying from 80 to 380 mm and age varying from 1 to 11 yrs. Across all waters, the von Bertalanffy growth parameters L8 varied from 231 to 490 mm (mean = 345 mm) and K varied from 0.15 to 0.76 (mean = 0.37). Survival estimates, constructed from age-length keys, were corrected for streams with mark-recapture data; for alpine lakes, corrections were made via gill net selectivity data. Survival varied from 0.30 to 0.56 (mean = 0.45), and except for one waterbody, estimates were minimally affected by correcting for capture efficiency. The proportion of the population that was male varied from 0.34 to 0.75 (mean = 0.53).

NORTHWEST SCIENCE,Abiotic and Biotic Factors Associated with Sculpin Presence and Density in Northern Idaho Streams,"Sculpins (family Cottidae) are a group of small nongame fishes, native to Idaho's colder streams, and have value for biodiversity and as indicators of water quality. We analyzed abiotic and biotic data, including habitat characteristics and presence of co-occurring trout and char (family Salmonidae) species, from 115 streams from the northern Idaho Pan-handle to identify the physical characteristics and biotic communities of the streams associated with sculpin presence (or absence) and population density. For comparison. and to determine if the results of the northern dataset could be attributed to the rest of the state, a second dataset from state-wide sampling was also analyzed, as was a subset of both datasets that had no observations of non-native brook trout and rainbow trout. Sculpins were more likely to be present and in higher densities in streams with abundant riffle microhabitats that were mostly free of sediment (identified as Rosgen channel types B, C, and F for northern Idaho and types B and C for the entire state). More sculpins were also found in streams lacking brook trout and rainbow trout.

NORTHWEST SCIENCE,"Comparative Population Dynamics, Flight Periods, and Volatile Pheromone Attraction of Tragosoma harrisii and Tragosoma soror (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in Idaho","Pheromone parsimony is widespread within the longhorned beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), which share a number of highly conserved volatile pheromone motifs. This parsimony reflects their life histories, ecology, and distribution. We conducted field bioassays testing attraction of cerambycids to 12 volatile pheromone lures at sites in both northern and southern Idaho over a period of three years. Our overall goals were to investigate the role of volatile pheromones in the geographic distribution of cerambycid species, interactions within cerambycid communities in reproductive isolation, and to identify attractive pheromones that can be used to develop lures for monitoring cerambycids. This study focused on the genus Tragosoma (subfamily: Prioninae). Trapping results suggested a regional split between populations of T. harrisii LeConte and T. soror Laplante within Idaho, with the more abundant of the two species at our sites being T. harrisii in northern Idaho and T. soror in southern Idaho. We found the flight periods of T. harrisii and T. soror overlapped, suggesting that flight period is not being used by these two species as a mechanism to prevent inter-specific cross-attraction among their populations in Idaho. Our results increase understanding of the ecology of Tragosoma species, and the role of pheromones and flight period phenology in maintaining reproductive isolation, and will aid in development of lures for monitoring cerambycids.",Cerambycidae; chemical ecology; flight phenology; pheromone parsimony,2021,95,2,10.3955/046.095.0204,0029-344X,19,160,215,1467,4,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes

Our objective was to describe female reproductive parameters and den use of two subspecies of wild, untrapped Pacific martens (Humboldt marten, Martes caurina humboldtensis; Sierran marten, M. c. sierrae) of conservation interest in California. We used radio telemetry and remotely triggered cameras to monitor 10 Humboldt martens (2014 to 2016) and six Sierran martens (2016 to 2017) over 23 total denning periods. For Humboldt martens, mean parturition date was 13 April, proportion of adult females reproducing was 80\% (n = 12 of 15), and mean litter size was 1.8 +/- 0.6 kits ((x) over bar +/- SD). For Sierran martens, mean parturition date was 29 April, proportion of adult females reproducing was 87\% (n = 7 of 8), and mean litter size was 1.9 +/- 0.7 kits. Humboldt and Sierran marten dens were predominantly located in woody structures, with live trees, snags, and logs comprising 91\% and 79\% of dens, respectively. Although reproductive ecologies of Humboldt and Sierran martens were largely similar, Sierran marten parturition dates were significantly later.

Our findings revealed distinct seasonal and spatial patterns in fish community composition, proportions of native and non-native fish species, and occurrence of fish that are potential juvenile salmon competitors and predators. We observed increased species richness and diversity with increased distance from the mouth of the Columbia River. Proportions of non-native species increased as well, and were especially high near the urban areas of the lower Columbia River. Species richness, density, and proportion of non-native species were higher during the summer months and positively correlated with water temperature. Juvenile salmonid density was highest in the spring, and salmonids were largely absent in the summer when non-native fish species were most abundant. Future increases in temperature, as expected with climate change, will favor further expansion of warm-water species, likely changing food web dynamics and having unpredictable effects on salmonids and other native fish populations.",salmonids; native; non-native; Columbia River; piscivores,2021,94,3-Apr,10.3955/046.094.0301,0029-344X,12,77,168,1180,5,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes

Our objective was to determine the presence and distribution of F. virilis in the Henrys Fork drainage of the Snake River. Sampling was conducted during summer and autumn 2018 at 30 sites located in Henrys Fork River drainage, including the major tributaries Teton River, North Fork Teton River, South Fork Teton River, and Moody Creek. We used baited minnow traps and kick nets to determine presence of F. virilis. Absence was only reported if we unsuccessfully captured F. virilis using kick nets because this technique is more effective. Faxonius virilis was detected in all five streams. We did not detect F. virilis at sites at the upstream extent of sampling. This pattern suggests that F. virilis are invading the drainage in an upstream direction.

NORTHWEST SCIENCE,Inviable Seed Set Affects Arthropod Damage to Seeds of Western Juniper (Juniperus occidentalis),"Retention and development of fruits containing inviable seeds has been considered anomalous, because such seeds cannot contribute to plant fitness. Although trees in the genus Juniperus are conifers and thus not true fruiting plants, junipers package seeds within fruit-like female cones commonly referred to as ``berries,{''} and juniper seeds often exhibit high levels of inviability. We tested the prediction that inviable seeds in western juniper (J. occidentalis) reduce levels of pre-dispersal seed predation by arthropods. From 2009 to 2014 we assessed production of berries and seeds in two northeast California populations of western juniper and documented presence of four arthropods (three seed predators, one fruit predator) as well as condition of seeds. The number of inviable seeds per juniper berry was directly associated with numbers of the pulp-feeding frugivore in berries collected both in fall and spring, suggesting that trees may abort seeds within berries experiencing heavy frugivore damage. Consistent with the hypothesis that inviable seeds can reduce seed predation, numbers of a granivorous mite were inversely related to numbers of inviable seeds in fall berry collections. However, the pattern switched to a direct relationship between mites and inviable seeds in spring-collected berries, perhaps due to the timing of mite infestation during berry development. Inviable seeds occurred most frequently during a year of mast production of juniper berries, and the lowest levels of seed damage by a granivorous chalcid wasp occurred during the mast year. The following year saw the greatest levels of seed damage by granivorous moths and mites, possible hold-over effects from large populations built during the mast year. The production of inviable seeds, together with satiating granivores through masting, may represent complementary mechanisms for reducing pre-dispersal seed predation.",Argyresthia spp.; Eurytoma juniperina; Henricus infernalis; masting; Periploca spp.; Trisetacus quadricetus,2021,95,1,10.3955/046.095.0102,0029-344X,13,95,281,1920,6,NA,250,5,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
OECOLOGIA,Integrating demographic niches and black spruce range expansion at subarctic treelines,"When investigating relationships between species' niches and distributions, niches can be divided demographically, resulting in unique niches for different life stages. This approach can identify changing substrate requirements throughout a species' life cycle. Using non-metric multidimensional scaling, we quantified microsite conditions associated with successful recruitment in the tundra landscape and successful seed production amongst adult trees of black spruce (Picea mariana) at subarctic treeline in Yukon, Canada to assess how life stage-specific requirements may impact the distribution of this widespread boreal tree species. Treeline ecotones in this region showed high heterogeneity in tundra microsites available for establishment. Black spruce exhibited changing microsite associations from germination to reproductive maturity, which were mainly driven by changes in plant community and soil moisture. These associations limit the microsites where individuals can establish and reproduce to a subset available within the heterogeneous landscape. Overall, we suggest that (1) substrates suitable for early recruitment are limited at the range edge; and (2) reproductive adults have a narrow niche, limiting successful seed production in adults and forming sink populations where suitable conditions are limited. Our multivariate assessment of microsite suitability can provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of a species throughout its life cycle and identify life stage-specific constraints to range expansion.",Picea mariana; Regeneration niche; Seed production; Seedling emergence; Range edge,2023,201,1,10.1007/s00442-022-05293-7,0029-8549,11,86,207,1546,5,15,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
OECOLOGIA,Plants with extrafloral nectaries share indirect defenses and shape the local arboreal ant community,"Associational resistance (AR) is a positive interaction in which a plant suffers less herbivore damage due to its association with a protective plant. Here, we evaluated whether plants with extra-floral nectaries (EFNs) can share indirect defenses with neighboring plants. We sampled 45 individuals of an EFN-bearing liana (Smilax polyantha) and recorded whether their support species had EFNs. In S. polyantha, we measured foliar herbivory and flower and fruit production. We examined the ant species composition and visitation of S. polyantha and whether they changed according to the supporting plant type (with or without EFNs). We experimentally determined whether S. polyantha supplemented with artificial nectaries could share indirect defenses with defenseless neighboring plants. Support plants with EFNs indirectly benefited S. polyantha by sharing mutualistic ant species. Smilax polyantha supported by plants with EFNs had a more specific ant species composition, a higher number of visiting ants and ant species richness, and exhibited nearly 3 times less foliar herbivory. However, we did not observe differences in fruit production between the two groups of S. polyantha. Finally, we observed that S. polyantha with artificial nectaries increased ant visitation on neighboring plants 2.5 times. We provide evidence that interspecific neighbors with EFNs can experience reciprocal benefits by sharing indirect defenses. Such local effects might escalate and affect the structure of plant communities.",Indirect defense; Facilitation; Mutualism; Nurse effect; Symbiosis; Tritrophic interaction,2023,201,1,10.1007/s00442-022-05286-6,0029-8549,14,100,218,1514,6,15,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
OECOLOGIA,Ant communities in disturbed subtropical landscapes: is climate more important than stochastic processes?,"Functional trait-based approaches have provided advances in the understanding of community assembly rules. Broad generalisations remain, however, limited due to the idiosyncratic nature of taxa and ecosystems, especially in tropical regions. We use fine scale resolution (30 m grid) environmental variables and community surveys from nearly 100 secondary tropical forest sites to study niche-based or neutral assembly mechanisms in ground dwelling ants. This provides a unique opportunity for understanding fine scale drivers of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in a region characterized by large topographic and climatic differences on a relatively small geographic scale. Precipitation emerged as the most consistent environmental correlate, in shaping taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional aspects of the communities. Functional diversity was weakly associated with topography and temperature related variables. The fourth corner model revealed that femur, scape and mandible length were key traits in response to precipitation, and that communities showed a functional homogenization towards shorter appendages at wetter sites. Our results suggest that neutral and deterministic assembly processes act in concert to shape the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional aspects of leaf litter ant assemblages.

OECOLOGIA,Behavioural adjustments of predators and prey to wind speed in the boreal forest,"Wind speed can have multifaceted effects on organisms including altering thermoregulation, locomotion, and sensory reception. While forest cover can substantially reduce wind speed at ground level, it is not known if animals living in forests show any behavioural responses to changes in wind speed. Here, we explored how three boreal forest mammals, a predator and two prey, altered their behaviour in response to average daily wind speeds during winter. We collected accelerometer data to determine wind speed effects on activity patterns and kill rates of free-ranging red squirrels (n = 144), snowshoe hares (n = 101), and Canada lynx (n = 27) in Kluane, Yukon from 2015 to 2018. All 3 species responded to increasing wind speeds by changing the time they were active, but effects were strongest in hares, which reduced daily activity by 25\%, and lynx, which increased daily activity by 25\%. Lynx also increased the number of feeding events by 40\% on windy days. These results highlight that wind speed is an important abiotic variable that can affect behaviour, even in forested environments.",Behavioural responses; Environmental variation; Predator detection; Predator-prey; Terrestrial; Thermoregulation,2022,200,3-Apr,10.1007/s00442-022-05266-w,0029-8549,13,80,176,1100,6,15,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
OECOLOGIA,Causes and consequences of differences in soil and seed microbiomes for two alpine plants,"Seed and soil microbiomes strongly affect plant performance, and these effects can scale-up to influence plant community structure. However, seed and soil microbial community composition are variable across landscapes, and different microbial communities can differentially influence multiple plant metrics (biomass, germination rate), and community stabilizing mechanisms. We determined how microbiomes inside seeds and in soils varied among alpine plant species and communities that differed in plant species richness and density. Across 10 common alpine plant species, we found a total of 318 bacterial and 128 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with seeds, with fungal richness affected by plant species identity more than sampling location. However, seed microbes had only marginally significant effects on plant germination success and timing. In contrast, soil microbes associated with two different plant species had significant effects on plant biomass, and their effect depended both on the plant species and the location the soils were sampled from. This led to significant changes in plant-soil feedback at different locations that varied in plant density and richness, such that plant-soil feedback favored plant species coexistence in some locations and opposed coexistence at other locations. Importantly, we found that coexistence-facilitating feedback was associated with low plant species richness, suggesting that soil microbes may promote the diversity of colonizing plants during the course of climate change and glacial recession.",Soil microbes; Seed microbes; Plant-soil feedback; Alpine; Germination,2022,200,3-Apr,10.1007/s00442-022-05271-z,0029-8549,14,89,220,1570,5,15,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
OECOLOGIA,Determining the role of richness and evenness in alpine grassland productivity across climatic and edaphic gradients,"Spatial heterogeneity of climatic and edaphic gradients can substantially affect the grassland productivity function. However, few studies have tested the importance of species richness and evenness on regulating grassland productivity across spatial-scale climatic and edaphic changes. This study examines the complex mechanisms by which species richness and evenness regulate productivity in alpine meadow and steppe. We used field survey data to explore above-ground productivity formation and sensitivity to spatial-scale climatic and edaphic response of alpine grassland based on species richness and evenness. Results showed that the growing season solar radiation was the main driving factor of above-ground biomass and was strongly negatively correlated with above-ground biomass. Furthermore, compared with alpine steppe, above-ground biomass in alpine meadow was more responsive to climatic variables, but less responsive to soil variables. Unexpectedly, we found that the regulation patterns of species richness and evenness on above-ground biomass were different in both habitats by a structural equation model analysis. Our study demonstrated that species evenness and richness were both important in co-regulating above-ground biomass in alpine meadow, whereas species richness mattered more than species evenness in regulating above-ground biomass in alpine steppe. Our results offer further support for species richness and evenness co-regulating grassland productivity across spatial-scale climatic and edaphic gradients, which helps maintain the benefits of plant diversity and alpine grassland ecosystems.",Climate; Grassland productivity; Sensitivity; Soil properties; Species diversity,2022,200,3-Apr,10.1007/s00442-022-05279-5,0029-8549,16,116,218,1624,5,15,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
OECOLOGIA,Energetic consequences of resource use diversity in a marine carnivore,"Understanding how intraspecific variation in the use of prey resources impacts energy metabolism has strong implications for predicting long-term fitness and is critical for predicting population-to-community level responses to environmental change. Here, we examine the energetic consequences of variable prey resource use in a widely distributed marine carnivore, juvenile sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus). We used carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to identify three primary prey resource pools-demersal omnivores, pelagic forage, and benthic detritivores and estimated the proportional assimilation of each resource using Bayesian mixing models. We then quantified how the utilization of these resource pools impacted the concentrations of six plasma lipids and how this varied by ontogeny. Sharks exhibited variable reliance on two of three predominant prey resource pools: demersal omnivores and pelagic forage. Resource use variation was a strong predictor of energetic condition, whereby individuals more reliant upon pelagic forage exhibited higher blood plasma concentrations of very low-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, and triglycerides. These findings underscore how intraspecific variation in resource use may impact the energy metabolism of animals, and more broadly, that natural and anthropogenically driven fluctuations in prey resources could have longer term energetic consequences.",Ecophysiology; Stable isotope analysis; Bayesian mixing model; Nutritional condition; Elasmobranch,2022,200,1-Feb,10.1007/s00442-022-05241-5,0029-8549,10,70,189,1411,5,15,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
OECOLOGIA,Relative contributions of parasite consumptive and non-consumptive effects to host population suppression in simulated fly-mite populations,"The ``ecology of fear{''} framework was developed to describe the impacts predators have on potential prey and prey populations, outside of consumption/predation (i.e. non-consumptive effects, NCEs). This framework has recently been extended to symbiotic interactions such as host-parasite associations. Although the NCEs of predators and parasites on their individual victims can be measured experimentally, it is currently not known whether parasites can exert population-level effects on potential hosts through their NCEs. Modelling can be a useful tool for scaling individual-level NCEs to populations to determine impacts on host population growth. In this study, we used previously published data on the consumptive and non-consumptive effects of an ectoparasitic mite (Macrocheles subbadius) on a fruit fly (Drosophila nigrospiracula) to simulate populations experiencing fear (NCEs only), both fear and infection (consumption + NCEs) or neither. Population-level models indicate that NCEs alone were insufficient to reduce population growth. In fact, host populations experiencing NCEs but not infection had slightly larger final populations than unexposed populations (by similar to 550 flies). This result suggests there is compensation (i.e. increased daily reproduction that overcomes shorter lifespans) among exposed flies. By contrast, the consumptive effects of parasites suppressed the growth of simulated host populations, and this deleterious impact grew non-linearly with infection prevalence.",Host-parasite interaction; Population growth; Ecology of fear; Statistical model; Compensation,2022,200,3-Apr,10.1007/s00442-022-05268-8,0029-8549,16,139,206,1513,5,15,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,An invasive seagrass drives its own success in two invaded seas by both negatively affecting native seagrasses and benefiting from those costs,"The nature and strength of interactions between native and invasive species can determine invasion success. Species interactions can drive, prevent or facilitate invasion, making understanding the nature and outcome of these interactions critical. We conducted mesocosm experiments to test the outcome of interactions between Halophila stipulacea, a seagrass that invaded the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas, and native seagrasses (Cymodocea nodosa and Syringodium filiforme, respectively) to elucidate mechanisms explaining the successful invasions. Mesocosms contained intact cores with species grown either mixed or alone. Overall, in both locations, there was a pattern of the invasive growing faster with the native than when alone, while also negatively affecting the native, with similar patterns for shoot density, aboveground and belowground biomass. In the Caribbean, H. stipulacea increased by 5.6 +/- 1.0 SE shoots in 6 weeks when grown with the native while, when alone, there was a net loss of -0.8 +/- 1.6 SE shoots. The opposite pattern occurred for S. filiforme, although these differences were not significant. While the pattern in the Mediterranean was the same as the Caribbean, with the invasive grown with the native increasing shoots more than when it grew alone, these differences for shoots were not significant. However, when measured as aboveground biomass, H. stipulacea had negative effects on the native C. nodosa. Our results suggest that a seagrass that invaded two seas may drive its own success by both negatively affecting native seagrasses and benefiting from that negative interaction. This is a novel example of a native seagrass species facilitating the success of an invasive at its own cost, providing one possible mechanism for the widespread success of this invasive species.",facilitation; invasion ecology; negative interactions; plant invasion; seagrasses; species interactions,2023,2023,3,10.1111/oik.09403,0030-1299,22,142,273,1819,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Cheating interactions favor modularity in mutualistic networks,"A fundamental fact about mutualisms is that these mutually beneficial interactions often harbor cheaters that benefit from the use of resources and services without providing any positive feedback to other species. The role of cheaters in the evolutionary dynamics of mutualisms has long been recognized, yet their broader impacts at the community level, beyond species they directly interact with, is still poorly understood. Because mutualisms form networks often involving dozens of species, indirect effects generated by cheaters may cascade through the whole community, reshaping trait evolution. Here, we study how cheating interactions can influence coevolution in mutualistic networks. We combined a coevolutionary model, empirical data on animal-plant mutualistic networks and numerical simulations to show that high trait disparity emerges as a consequence of the negative effect of cheaters on victim fitness, which in turn fuels selection favoring victim traits that are increasingly different from the cheaters' traits. Intermediate levels of cheating interactions in a network can lead to the formation of groups of species phenotypically similar to each other and distinct from species in other groups, generating clustered trait patterns. The resulting clustered trait pattern, in turn, changes the pattern of interaction in simulated networks, fostering the formation of modules of interacting species and reducing nestedness. Our results indicate that directional selection imposed by cheaters on their victims counteracts selection for trait convergence imposed by mutualists, leading to the emergence of modules of phenotypically similar interacting species but phenotypically distinct from other modules. Based on these results, we suggest that cheaters might be a fundamental missing element for our understanding of how multispecies selection shapes the trait distribution and structure of mutualistic networks.",coevolution; ecological network; modularity; mutualism; network structure,2023,2023,3,10.1111/oik.09176,0030-1299,7,62,273,1934,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Correlation between fine root traits and pathogen richness depends on plant mycorrhizal types,"Root uptake strategies are associated with the strength of negative plant-soil feedback (PSF) induced by soil pathogens. Given the intensified effect of pathogen richness in fine roots on the strength of negative PSF through the synergistic effects of multiple pathogens, researchers have proposed a trade-off between nutrient acquisition and pathogen defence in roots. However, empirical evidence is lacking. In addition, because the interaction between pathogens and fine roots depends on the mycorrhizal types of tree species, both fine root traits and mycorrhizal types should be incorporated to reveal covariation in pathogen richness and the strength of negative PSF. In this study, we selected 50 arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree species and 7 ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree species in a subtropical forest to investigate the relationships between fine root traits and pathogen richness in fine roots and determined whether their relationships depended on plant mycorrhizal types. Our results showed that pathogen richness was negatively correlated with fine root diameter but was positively correlated with specific root length for the AM-associated species, while for the ECM-associated species, the pathogen richness was only found to have a significant negative relationship with the relative abundance of ECM fungi. These findings highlight the difference between AM- and ECM-associated species in pathogen defence and bridge the gap between root traits and pathogen richness, which is significant for improving our understanding of the potential factors mediating the strength of PSF and thus maintaining tree species diversity.",arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; ectomycorrhizal fungi; fine root traits; pathogen richness; plant-soil feedback; root economics space,2023,2023,1,10.1111/oik.09354,0030-1299,13,93,237,1637,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,"Diversity, food web structure and the temporal stability of total plant and animal biomasses","Food-web complexity and species richness are predicted to have tremendous effects on ecosystem functioning stability. Yet, our understanding of the relation between diversity and the stability of ecosystem functioning is still mainly limited to single trophic level communities and highly simplified food webs. To start filling this knowledge gap, we model allometric food webs and use structural equation modelling (SEM) to investigate the relations between diversity, food web structure and the temporal variability of total plant and animal biomasses and their components, i.e. synchrony and mean population variability. We find that stability responds differently depending on the metric used. When looking at total biomass variability, higher total biomasses and biomass stored at higher trophic level have the strongest stabilising effects, while species richness has lower impact than previously found. We confirm that synchrony among species is important for the stability of the total plant biomass. However, synchrony only weakly explains variations in the stability of total animal biomass among food webs. Species richness and food web variables often have opposite impacts on synchrony and mean population variability, leading to more ambiguous results for the plant community as synchrony matters only for plant stability. Our approach thus provides new insight on the complexity of the stability of ecosystem functioning in complex food webs.",diversity; ecosystem functioning; food webs; stability; temporal stability; theory,2023,2023,2,10.1111/oik.08769,0030-1299,14,92,212,1457,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Ecological determinants of variation in phenotypic selection on quantitative immune defence traits,"Immune defence is an important determinant of organismal fitness. While theoretical models based on tradeoffs in resource allocation predict quantitative immune traits to be subject to stabilizing selection due to associated energetic costs and self-harm, empirical studies report mainly positive directional selection. This discrepancy may arise from multiple ecological factors that vary in nature and could influence selection. We examined if selection on immune activity varies depending on immune challenge/infection risk, between immune traits and among populations in the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. We assessed selection on the phenoloxidase-like and antibacterial activity of snail haemolymph while manipulating the level of immune challenge imposed by environmental microbes. We did this using snails from multiple populations and also quantified within-population family-level variation (i.e. evolutionary potential) in the snails' immune activity. We found that the strength of immune challenge and the examined immune trait determined selection on the snails' immune function. Thus, variation in infection risk can be an important factor in maintaining genetic variation in defence traits. Additionally, immune traits showed low among-population differentiation but high within-population genetic variation. This pattern could arise if natural snail populations are exposed to higher temporal than spatial variation in infection risk.",ecological immunology; Gastropoda; immunocompetence; Mollusca; parasite resistance; selection gradient,2023,2023,2,10.1111/oik.09506,0030-1299,12,98,196,1455,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Ectoparasites population dynamics are affected by host body size but not host density or water temperature in a 32-year long time series,"Host density, host body size and ambient temperature have all been positively associated with increases in parasite infection. However, the relative importance of these factors in shaping long-term parasite population dynamics in wild host populations is unknown due to the absence of long-term studies. Here, we examine long-term drivers of gill lice (Copepoda) infections in Arctic charr (Salmonidae) over 32 years. We predicted that host density and body size and water temperature would all positively affect parasite population size and population growth rate. Our results show that fish size was the main driver of gill lice infections in Arctic charr. In addition, Arctic charr became infected at smaller sizes and with more parasites in years of higher brown trout population size. Negative intraguild interactions between brown trout and Arctic charr appear to drive smaller Arctic charr to seek refuge in deeper areas of the lake, thus increasing infection risk. There was no effect of host density on the force of infection, and the relationship between Arctic charr density and parasite mean abundance was negative, possibly due to an encounter-dilution effect. The population densities of host and parasite fluctuated independently of one another. Water temperature had negligible effects on the temporal dynamics of the gill lice population. Understanding long-term drivers of parasite population dynamics is key for research and management. In fish farms, artificially high densities of hosts lead to vast increases in the transmission of parasitic copepods. However, in wild fish populations fluctuating at natural densities, the surface area available for copepodid attachment might be more important than the density of available hosts.",Arctic charr; gill lice; host density; Salmincola edwardsii; Salvelinus alpinus,2023,2023,3,10.1111/oik.09328,0030-1299,22,136,263,1754,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Environmental context determines pollution impacts on ecosystem functioning,"Global change assessments have typically ignored synthetic chemical pollution, despite the rapid increase of pharmaceuticals, pesticides and industrial chemicals in the environment. Part of the problem reflects the multifarious origins of these micropollutants, which can derive from urban and agricultural sources. Understanding how micropollutants harm ecosystems is a major scientific challenge due to asymmetries of stress across trophic levels and ecological surprises generated by multiple drivers interacting in human-impacted landscapes. We used field assays above and below municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 60 sampling locations across 20 Swiss streams to test how micropollutants and nutrients originating from WWTPs affect two trophic levels (microbes and detritivores) and their role in leaf litter processing. Wastewater impacts were asymmetric across trophic levels, with the detritivore contribution declining relative to microbial-driven decomposition. The strength of negative impacts were context dependent, peaking at sites with the highest upstream abundances of detritivorous invertebrates. Diffuse pollution from intensive agriculture and wastewater-born micropollutants contributed to reduced litter processing rates, including indirect effects apparently mediated through negative influences of insecticides on detritivores. Asymmetries in stress responses across trophic levels can introduce quantitative changes in consumer-resource dynamics and leaf litter processing. This means functional redundancies at different trophic levels are insufficient to compensate for biodiversity losses, causing environmental stressors such as chemical pollutants to have pervasive ecosystem-level impacts.",biodiversity; decomposition; micropollutants; multiple stressors; nutrients; wastewater,2023,2023,2,10.1111/oik.09131,0030-1299,8,75,219,1733,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Environmental drivers of local abundance-mass scaling in soil animal communities,"The relationship between species' body masses and densities is strongly conserved around a three-quarter power law when pooling data across communities. However, studies of local within-community relationships have revealed major deviations from this general pattern, which has profound implications for their stability and functioning. Despite multiple contributions of soil communities to people, there is limited knowledge on the drivers of body mass-abundance relationships in these communities. We compiled a dataset comprising 155 soil-animal communities across four countries (Canada, Germany, Indonesia, USA), all sampled using the same methodology. We tested if variation in local climatic and edaphic conditions drives differences in local body mass-abundance scaling relationships. We found substantial variation in the slopes of this power-law relationship across local communities. Structural equation modeling showed that soil temperature and water content have a positive and negative net effect, respectively, on soil communities. These effects are mediated by changes in local edaphic conditions (soil pH and carbon content) and the body-mass range of the communities. These results highlight ways in which alterations of soil climatic and edaphic conditions interactively impact the distribution of abundance between populations of small and large animals. These quantitative mechanistic relationships facilitate our understanding of how global changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature and precipitation, will affect community-abundance distributions and thus the stability and functioning of soil-animal communities.",body mass; density; invertebrates; precipitation; temperature,2023,2023,2,10.1111/oik.09735,0030-1299,10,80,220,1651,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Fire favors sexual precocity in a Mediterranean pine,"Wildfires are a natural disturbance in many ecosystems. Consequently, plant species have acquired traits that allow them to resist and regenerate in an environment with recurrent fires. A key trait in fire-prone ecosystems is the age at first reproduction (maturity age); populations of non-resprouting species cannot persist when the fire interval is shorter than this age. Maturity age is variable among individuals, so we hypothesized that short fire intervals select for early seed production (precocity). We selected 13 plots with different fire regimes in eastern Spain, all dominated by Pinus halepensis (a non-resprouting serotinous pine species). Then, we evaluated the age at first reproduction and the size of the canopy seed bank of each individual tree. Our results show a significant effect of fire regime on the onset of reproduction in this species, suggesting a selection towards higher precocity in populations subject to shorter fire intervals. Due to this higher precocity, pines stored more cones and therefore, increased their potential for reproduction post-fire. We provide the first field evidence that fire can act as a driver of precocity. Being precocious in fire-prone environments is adaptive because it increases the probability of having a significant seed bank when the next fire arrives.",evolutionary ecology; fire traits; global change; maturity age; Pinus halepensis; serotiny,2023,2023,3,10.1111/oik.09373,0030-1299,8,52,201,1321,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Geomorphology shapes relationships between animal communities and ecosystem function in large rivers,"Understanding how the Earth's surface (i.e. `nature's stage') influences connections between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) is a central objective in ecology. Despite recent calls to examine these connections at multiple trophic levels and at more complex and realistic scales, little is known about how landscape structure shapes BEF relationships among animal communities in nature. We coupled high-resolution habitat mapping with extensive field sampling to quantify connections among the geophysical habitat templet, invertebrate assemblages and secondary production in two large North American riverscapes. Patterns of sediment size governed invertebrate assemblage structure, with particularly strong effects on composition, richness and taxonomic and functional diversity. These relationships propagated to drive positive relationships between biodiversity and secondary production that were modified by scale, context-dependencies and anthropogenic modification. Finally, leveraging spatially-explicit descriptions of geophysical and biological properties, we uncovered distinct and nested spatial scales of biodiversity and secondary production, and suggest that multiple geophysical processes simultaneously influence these patterns at different scales. Together, our findings advance our understanding of relationships between the physical templet and patterns of BEF, and help to predict how perturbations to the Earth's surface may propagate to influence biodiversity and energy flux through food webs.",biodiversity and ecosystem function; invertebrates; large river; riverscape; secondary production,2023,2023,2,10.1111/oik.09431,0030-1299,12,100,195,1526,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Host plant phenology shapes aphid abundance and interactions with ants,"Phenological mismatch can occur when plants and herbivores differentially respond to changing phenological cues, such as temperature or snow melt date. This often shifts herbivore feeding to plant stages of lower quality. How herbivores respond to plant quality may be also mediated by temperature, which could lead to temperature-by-phenology interactions. We examined how aphid abundance and mutualism with ants were impacted by temperature and host plant phenology. In this study system, aphids Aphis asclepiadis colonize flowering stalks of the host plant, Ligusticum porteri. Like other aphids, abundance of this species is dependent on ant protection. To understand how host plant phenology and temperature affect aphid abundance, we used a multiyear observational study and a field experiment. We observed 20 host plant populations over five years (2017-2021), tracking temperature and snow melt date as well as host plant phenology and insect abundance. We found host plant and aphid phenology to differentially respond to temperature and snow melt timing. Early snow melt accelerated host plant phenology to a greater extent than aphid phenology, which was more responsive to temperature. Both the likelihood of aphid colony establishment and ant recruitment were reduced when aphids colonized host plants at post-flowering stages. In 2019, we experimentally accelerated host plant phenology by advancing snow melt date by two weeks. We factorially combined this treatment with open top warming chambers surrounding aphid colonies. Greatest growth occurred for colonies under ambient temperatures when they occurred on host plants at the flowering stage. Altogether, our results suggest that phenological mismatch with host plants can decrease aphid abundance, and this effect is exacerbated by temperature increases and changes to the ant-aphid mutualism.",aphid-ant mutualism; aphids; climate change; phenology,2023,2023,2,10.1111/oik.09109,0030-1299,10,70,272,1865,4,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Irregular population cycles driven by environmental stochasticity and saddle crawlbys,"Despite considerable study of population cycles, the striking variability of cycle periods in many cyclic populations has received relatively little attention. Mathematical models of cyclic population dynamics have historically exhibited much greater regularity in cycle periods than many real populations, even when accounting for environmental stochasticity. We contend, however, that the recent focus on understanding the impact of long, transient but recurrent epochs within population oscillations points the way to a previously unrecognized means by which environmental stochasticity can create cycle period variation. Specifically, consumer-resource cycles that bring the populations near a saddle point (a combination of population sizes toward which the populations tend, before eventually transitioning to substantially different levels) may be subject to a slow passage effect that has been dubbed a `saddle crawlby'. In this study, we illustrate how stochasticity that generates variability in how close predator and prey populations come to saddles can result in substantial variability in the durations of crawlbys and, as a result, in the periods of population cycles. Our work suggests a new mechanistic hypothesis to explain an important factor in the irregular timing of population cycles and provides a basis for understanding when environmental stochasticity is, and is not, expected to generate cyclic dynamics with variability across periods.",periodic orbits; predator-prey dynamics; Rosenzweig-MacArthur; saddle points,2023,2023,2,10.1111/oik.09290,0030-1299,10,85,207,1464,4,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Linking microenvironment modification to species interactions and demography in an alpine plant community,"Individual plants can modify the microenvironment within their spatial neighborhood. However, the consequences of microenvironment modification for demography and species interactions remain unclear at the community scale. In a study of co-occurring alpine plants, we 1) determined the extent of species-specific microclimate modification by comparing temperature and soil moisture between vegetated and non-vegetated microsites for several focal species. We 2) determined how vital rates (survival, growth, fecundity) of all species varied in response to aboveground and belowground vegetative overlap with inter- and intraspecific neighbors as proxies for microenvironment modification. For 1), surface temperatures were buffered (lower maximums and higher minimums) and soil moisture was higher below the canopies of most species compared to non-vegetated areas. For 2), vegetative overlap predicted most vital rates, although the effect varied depending on whether aboveground or belowground overlap was considered. Vital rate response to microenvironment-modification proxies (vegetative overlap) was also frequently context dependent with respect to plant size and macroclimate. Microenvironment modification and spatial overlapping of individuals are key drivers of demography and species interactions in this alpine community.",alpine; community dynamics; demography; microenvironment modification; species interactions; vital rates,2023,2023,3,10.1111/oik.09235,0030-1299,13,105,175,1334,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Long-lasting effects of harsh early-life conditions on adult survival of a long-lived vertebrate,"Early life conditions, especially in long-lived organisms, can have both immediate and long-lasting effects in vital traits generating demographic structure across cohorts. Multiple non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explore this question. For instance, the silver spoon, the viability selection or the predictive adaptive response hypothesis, predict that long lasting effects resulting from harsh early conditions could be negative, positive or vary with current environmental conditions, respectively. We use an 18-year capture-mark-recapture dataset on adult Audouin's gulls Ichthyaetus audouinii to test for these different hypotheses while accounting for age, breeding experience and large-scale dispersal. Audouin's gull cohorts experiencing harsh conditions during early life (i.e. nestling period and first winter) are known to experience lower first year survival. Here, we show that early life conditions also explained a large proportion (54\%) of adult survival variation among cohorts. However, adulthood cohorts experiencing poor early life conditions had higher adult survival, in accordance with the viability selection hypothesis. Our results also show that apparent inexperienced breeders showed lower survival than experienced ones. Moreover, adult survival decreased with age. These results could suggest an increased cost of reproduction for deferred breeders, individual quality differences or survival senescence in this population. Overall, our study highlights the importance of early development, age and breeding experience as potential factors generating heterogeneity of survival between cohorts.

OIKOS,Physiological responses of fen mosses along a nitrogen gradient point to competition restricting their fundamental niches,"Nutrient availability determines vegetation patterns and ecological functioning of intact groundwater-fed peatlands (fens). Bryophytes, commonly referred to as `brown mosses', dominate calcareous fens (rich fens), are an integral part of their unique biodiversity and contribute significantly to peat formation and carbon sequestration. Brown mosses are replaced by vascular plants as nutrient availability increases. The decline of brown mosses may either be due to their physiological intolerance of high nutrient levels or to them being outcompeted by vascular plants. We aimed to distinguish between these two hypotheses by investigating whether the ecological optima reflect the physiological optima of brown mosses. Eight brown moss species, common in calcareous fens of the northern hemisphere, were grown under a gradient of nitrogen and phosphorus availability. Biomass increment, chlorophyll content and biomass nutrient concentration were measured. All brown moss species studied achieved the highest growth rates and chlorophyll contents when grown under conditions of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations higher than those where they occur naturally at the highest frequency. Two of the species showed no growth saturation even at the highest levels of nutrient availability, while the others appeared potassium-limited at the highest N and P levels. Brown mosses dominate natural fens at the lower edge of their physiological optimum in terms of nutrient availability, i.e. their realized niche is much narrower than the fundamental one. Based on the literature, we argue that it is the competition for light with vascular plants which limits the occurrence of brown mosses in nutrient-rich habitats and prevents them from occupying their entire fundamental niche.",bryophytes; calcareous fens; ecological versus physiological optimum; nutrient limitation; productivity gradient; realised versus fundamental niche,2023,2023,2,10.1111/oik.09336,0030-1299,16,121,256,1780,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Plant functional groups and phylogenetic regularity control plant community bioelement composition through calcium and magnesium,"The identification of drivers of bioelement concentrations in plant communities is crucial for our understanding of ecosystem functioning. In this respect, soil nutrients, plant biodiversity and functional groups are reported to affect the plant community bioelement composition. However, given the predominant focus on species richness and single elements (or stoichiometric ratios) so far, only little is known about the patterns of the whole suite of bioelements at the community level and whether these patterns can be predicted by evolutionary relationships between co-occurring species (phylogenetic diversity). To explore this knowledge gap, we used a comprehensive dataset of soil nutrients, plant community composition, phylogeny and aboveground tissue bioelement data from experimental sites established in central European semi-natural grasslands. Plant community bioelement composition was strongly and exponentially related to community calcium and magnesium (bioelements reflecting deep phylogenetic differences). Plant community bioelement composition and stoichiometry were best indicated by functional group composition (graminoids and forbs) and phylogenetic regularity, whereas phylogenetic richness, phylogenetic divergence and species richness were poor predictors. Bioelement-rich communities were poor in graminoids and rich in forbs, and tended to have evenly distributed phylogenetic distances (high regularity). No confounding effect of soil nutrients was observed. The links between functional group composition, phylogenetic regularity and plant community bioelement composition suggest that functional groups and phylogenetic diversity are mechanistically connected to ecosystem functions, such as primary production, decomposition, biogeochemical cycling or plant-herbivore interactions, through bioelements.",ecological stoichiometry; ecosystem functioning; elementome; functional groups; phylogenetic regularity,2023,2023,4,10.1111/oik.09546,0030-1299,15,128,231,1838,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Altered rainfall patterns due to climate change will also disrupt water availability for terrestrial organisms already facing climatic warming. To explore how organisms may adjust to changes in multiple, concurrent climate-related environmental conditions, we manipulated day and night temperatures as well as water availability during gestation in female common lizards Zootoca vivipara, a cold and wet adapted species facing climatic changes notably in populations located on the warm margin. We jointly manipulated temperature (hot or cold) independently during the daytime and nighttime as well as water availability (+/- ad libitum access to water) throughout pregnancy and quantified the effects on maternal traits (morphology, physiology and phenology) and reproductive output. Overall, we found that higher day or night temperatures decreased gestation length and increased energetic demands. Higher temperatures during the day, coupled with water restrictions, increased dehydration and water restrictions affected ability to allocate resources but had no impact on reproductive output. While high temperatures during the day were beneficial to current reproductive output and success, high temperatures during the night had the opposite effect. Our results suggest that high nighttime temperatures can dramatically increase the burden on pregnant mothers already constrained by heavy resource and water investment. This could provide a mechanistic explanation for the long-term declines of warm-margin populations in this species.",climate change; environmental constraints; hydration; pregnancy; reproductive output; temperature,2023,2023,3,10.1111/oik.09536,0030-1299,24,158,231,1672,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Reproductive skews of territorial species in heterogeneous landscapes,"The socio-spatial organization of populations of territorial species refers to the way distance, variation in social status and variation in resource availability interact to shape the way territory-bounded individuals are distributed. I investigated the resulting reproductive skew, i.e. the emergence of a few high performers amidst a majority of mediocre performers, using lifetime reproductive success data from 46 species living in contrasting landscape configurations. I applied three skew statistics that captured different aspects of the individual heterogeneity: the skewness, the Gini coefficient of inequalities and Hill's index of heavy-tailed distribution. I also used a simplistic theoretical model, in which only immediate neighbors interacted. In the comparative analysis, the distribution of lifetime reproductive success was more skewed but also more egalitarian in homogeneous than heterogeneous landscapes, after controlling for the allometric effect of the body mass. The simulations indicated that a possible explanatory mechanism for the change in egalitarian properties is that some individuals hide behind their neighbors in the socio-spatial organization. They therefore secure a better territory than if the distribution was despotic. The ideal despotic model without spatial restriction on interactions could not explain the correlations. This work emphasizes that the shape of the distribution of fitness components conveys information besides the mean and the variance, and the potential for nontrivial effects to emerge from simple movement heuristics.",heavy-tailed distribution; ideal despotic distribution; Pareto; peer of a peer; socio-spatial structure,2023,2023,2,10.1111/oik.09627,0030-1299,8,69,219,1583,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,Sub-seasonal correlation between growth and survival in three sympatric aquatic ectotherms,"Animals experience seasonally changing conditions in temperate regions, thus population vital rates change seasonally. However, knowledge is lacking on patterns of seasonal correlation between growth and survival in sympatric ectotherms, and this knowledge gap limits our understanding of environmental change impacts on animal populations and communities. Here, we investigated sub-seasonal (two-month intervals) correlation between growth and survival in three stream fishes (bluehead chub Nocomis leptocephalus, creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus and mottled sculpin Cottus bairdii) in South Carolina, USA, via a mark-recapture survey over 28 months. We found that patterns of temporal correlation between the population vital rates differed among the sympatric species. Growth increased and survival decreased with water temperature in two eurythermal species, resulting in negative correlation between growth and survival. Growth peaked in sub-seasons with an intermediate water temperature range in a third stenothermal species, while survival decreased with water temperature for this species too. Consequently, there was not significant negative or positive correlation between sub-seasonal growth and survival in the stenothermal species. Body condition (weight at given length) decreased from May through November in all three species, providing a potential physiological explanation for why survival rates were lower during this period. Negative correlation among population vital rates stabilizes population size over time and buffers animal populations from environmental change because the vital rates are not affected simultaneously in the same direction, indicating some degree of resiliency in the face of climate changes in the two eurythermal species. However, such a demographic mechanism of resiliency could be maintained so long as climate warming does not exceed optimal growth temperature, above which negative correlation between growth and survival may no longer be maintained.",Bayesian analysis; Cormack-Jolly-Seber model; demography; mark-recapture; native fish,2023,2023,3,10.1111/oik.09685,0030-1299,11,90,274,2003,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
OIKOS,The effect of temperature on fish swimming and schooling is context dependent,"Temperature is highly influential on the physiology and behaviour of ectotherms. In fish, temperature affects social interactions such as schooling behaviour, a common defence against predation. However, the effect of temperature on the ability of schooling fish to collectively respond to a predator is unknown. Here we used a loom stimulus to simulate an approaching predator that elicited a fleeing response in schooling fish over a range of water temperatures (9-29 degrees C) and group sizes (1-16 fish). While speed and acceleration always exhibited a positive curvilinear response to temperature, the optimal temperature at which performance peaked was different during the predation threat versus when they were unperturbed. Similarly, group-level metrics were sensitive to temperature immediately after a loom stimulus but showed no response to temperature during unperturbed swimming. The time taken for fish to respond to the loom stimulus was minimal at 20 degrees C. The proportion of fish that startled, during a loom, peaked at 13 degrees C - around the same temperature at which speed, and acceleration was maximum. Taken together, our results suggest that ectothermic fish may be able to compensate for their slower swim speeds at lower temperatures during unperturbed swimming by increasing their sensitivity to startle in response to a predation threat. More generally, we show that in ectotherms the qualitative and quantitative effect of temperature on a behavioural trait may be dependent on the context.",behavioral ecology; collective behavior; golden shiners; predation; thermal ecology,2023,2023,2,10.1111/oik.09202,0030-1299,12,77,232,1526,5,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
ORGANISMS DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION,A process ontology of organisms and its connection to biological individuality concepts,"Recent research uncovering extraordinary organismal complexity (e.g., extent of symbiotic associations, genetic exchange between organisms) has led to empirical challenges concerning the recognition of individuality in biological organisms. Our ability to distinguish between organisms, parts of organisms, and groups of organisms is now more problematic. Further, this has led to philosophical challenges concerning the concept of biological individuality. The holobiont, or metaorganism, can be characterized as a host organism having important associations with numerous species of organismal exo- and endosymbionts, many of which are required for the proper function of the complex whole. The holobiont (indeed, all organisms) are also exposed to potential horizontal gene exchange throughout their life cycle. The blurring of organismality continues to the level of colonial organisms and other socially cooperating entities. Epistemologically, we recognize the metaorganism as a processual system subject to continuous change in itself and in relation to its environment. Whereas the metaorganism resists individuation in terms of its intrinsic properties of mixed origin, it acts as an individual by engaging in causal interactions that are predicated on its integrative nature and emergent properties. In terms of the biological individuality debate, the question is not ``is the metaorganism a biological individual?{''} The question is rather ``what individuating processes does the metaorganism (or any organism) engage in?{''} When explained in terms of the causal properties and propensities of its parts (which are of potentially mixed origin), the underlying conception of the metaorganism is that of a homeostatic property cluster. Thus, for metaorganisms, a hierarchical dialectic between natural kindness and individuality exists, depending on the epistemic project being pursued.

ORGANISMS DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION,A widespread commensal loses its identity: suggested taxonomic revision for Indotyphlops braminus (Scolecophidia: Typhlopidae) based on molecular data,"The widespread human commensal blindsnake species Indotyphlops braminus is currently the only known obligate parthenogenetic snake species. It is also known to be triploid. However, much of these data is from specimens collected outside India which is the native range of this species. Polyploidy and parthenogenesis are often associated with hybridization in amphibians and lizards. In this study, we generated nuclear and mitochondrial data from multiple Indotyphlops lineages from across peninsular India and investigated the possible hybrid origin of I. braminus. Species delimitation suggested three putative species, one of which was I. pammeces and the other two morphologically matched I. braminus. One of these was confined to the wet zone (high rainfall areas) while the other was largely distributed in the dry zone. There was wide discordance in the relationships between these lineages across markers and different tree building approaches suggesting past or ongoing geneflow. The statistical test for hybridization also implied geneflow across these three lineages. Furthermore, the dry zone I. braminus appears to be true I. braminus as the topotypic material falls within this clade. These results suggest that the widespread, commensal, and parthenogenetic Indotyphlops is a separate species from I. braminus, and further investigation is required to determine diagnostic morphological characters for a species description.",Typhlopidae; Hybridization; Phylogenetics; Parthenogenesis,2023,23,1,10.1007/s13127-022-00577-5,1439-6092,18,150,208,1440,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ORGANISMS DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION,"Cryptic subterranean diversity: regional phylogeography of the sand termite Psammotermes allocerus Silvestri, 1908 in the wider Namib region","Psammotermes allocerus Silvestri, 1908 is the only described species representing the genus Psammotermes Desneux, 1902 in Southern Africa. The large geographical range of this subterranean termite covers both summer and winter rainfall regimes. Deadwood is the preferred food when available, but in more arid habitats, both live and dead grasses form the major dietary component. Along the Namib Desert margins, the species' localised herbivory creates circular bare patches known as fairy circles. For a regional phylogeographic study of this species, we sampled 65 sand termite populations within drier parts of Namibia, South Africa, and Angola. Based on combined molecular and ecological data, we found considerable genetic diversification within P. allocerus. Analyses of two mitochondrial markers (COI, COII), including a Bayesian inference tree, haplotype analysis and genetic distances suggest a delineation into seven highly differentiated genetic groups. The `Succulent Karoo' group is additionally characterised by unique features of the royal chamber, nest and tunnel system. In conclusion, our data suggest that P. allocerus should be not regarded as one species but as a species complex. Termites of each analysed group `Northern Namib', `Western Kalahari Basin', `Nama', `Southwestern Kalahari', `East Gariep', `Southern Namib' and `Succulent Karoo' should be considered as distinct species.

The species significantly diverge in skull shape. The skull of B. spinosus is shorter and higher, with a ventral arm of the squamosal bone and the jaw articulation point positioned perpendicular to the braincase, in comparison with a more lateral position in B. bufo. In either species, females have a shorter snout and a higher and wider skull at the jaw articulation point that is positioned more posteriorly, in comparison with conspecific males. High variation in the amount of bone ossification was recorded in both species, ranging from scarcely ossified and loosely connected bones to highly ossified and firmly connected bones. We also found that skull shape and inferred kinetic properties of the skull are highly variable across the Bufonini tribe. However, sample sizes are mostly small and intraspecific variation is high, which might compromise the analyses. Overall, the results suggest that developmental plasticity produces high variation in ossification and cranial kinesis, affecting individuals' feeding performances. At the population level, this variation supports an efficient exploitation of the habitat and may promote morphological adaptation in a changing environment.",Bone connections; Bufo bufo; Bufo spinosus; Geometric morphometrics; Micro-CT scanning; Phylogeny; Skull shape; Skull size,2023,23,1,10.1007/s13127-022-00585-5,1439-6092,10,71,215,1446,8,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ORGANISMS DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION,Divergent evolution of mitogenomics in Cetartiodactyla niche adaptation,"The superorder Cetartiodactyla has expanded to occupy a wide range of terrestrial and marine niches with very different energy requirements. As mitochondria are the primary site of energy production, we hypothesized that the structure and evolutionary rate of Cetartiodactyla mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been influenced by the metabolic requirements of different ecological niches. In this study, we constructed full-length mtDNA sequences for four Cetartiodactyla species: Babyrousa babyrussa, Stenella clymene, Stenella frontalis, and Cephalorhynchus commersonii. We performed comparative mitochondrial genome analysis, selection pressure analyses, and phylogenetic independent contrasts (PIC) analysis to detect the structure and evolutionary rate of mitogenomes from Cetartiodactyla native to plain, plateau, and marine niches. We found that the structure of Cetartiodactyla mtDNA was consistent across three niches. However, selection pressure analyses showed that the evolutionary rate of mtDNA protein-coding genes (PCGs) was significantly different between niches. The marine Cetartiodactyla had the highest rate of PCG evolution, while in terrestrial species, the evolutionary rate of all PCGs except ND3 and ND6 was faster in plateau Cetartiodactyla than in plain Cetartiodactyla. PIC analysis also demonstrated that PCG evolutionary rates were positively correlated with niche type (R-2 = 0.1226, p = 0.04239).

ORGANISMS DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION,Finding a home for the ram's horn squid: phylogenomic analyses support Spirula spirula (Cephalopoda: Decapodiformes) as a close relative of Oegopsida,"The molluscan clade Decapodiformes (Cephalopoda) comprises a diverse and enigmatic assemblage including inshore and offshore squids, bobtails, cuttlefishes, and the ram's horn squid (Spirulida: Spirula spirula). The latter species is of particular interest to paleontologists because it is the only living cephalopod with an internal chambered, spiral-shaped, calcareous shell resembling those seen in some fossil cephalopod taxa. Spirulida has been difficult to place phylogenetically, in part because it shares different features with sepiolids, sepiids, and oegopsids, creating conflict in morphological analyses. Unlike morphological assumptions of a close relationship with sepiids, previous molecular studies have found support for Spirulida as a close relative of Bathyteuthida and Oegopsida. Identifying the correct phylogenetic placement of Spirulida could allow alternative hypotheses of phragmocone evolution, e.g., retention of an ancestral phragmocone in Spirulida and Sepiida vs. independent reacquisition of the phragmocone in these taxa, to be evaluated. In the present study, we combined new, high-quality transcriptome data for a specimen of Spirula spirula with additional new and previously published transcriptome data for decapodiform cephalopods. Phylogenetic analyses of several matrices yielded trees in which Spirula spirula was recovered as the sister group of the oceanic open-eyed squids (Oegopsida).

De novo characterisation of these key taxa now allows to describe tardigrade species diversity with improved precision and at higher rate, increasing the momentum towards resolving the taxonomic impediment in these micro-invertebrates. Since its description, Diaforobiotus islandicus (Richters, 1904) has been reported from many distinct localities around the world. This suggested, perhaps falsely, a cosmopolitan nature of the species. However, potential erroneous assignment of newly found populations to this species could be a result of the very general and superficial original description. In order to properly recognise and name species diversity within the genus, I provide here an integrative redescription of the type species (D. islandicus) with a neotype designation, a description of a new species, Diaforbiotus svalbardicus sp. nov, and dichotomous key for the genus.

Fresh material of buds, functionally unisexual flowers and fruits were studied using a stack shot camera. Fixed such material of Cordia crenata, C. cf. grandicalyx and C. sinensis was sectioned using a microtome and stained with safranin red and astra blue, and the gynoecial surface was studied using SEM. The stamens of the female flowers are largely intact, but do not produce pollen, whereas the gynoecium of the male flowers is highly reduced though develops ovules lacking an embryo sac. The morphologically rather unreduced stamens of the female flower may have undergone a shift of function from producing pollen towards attracting pollinators by optical signals.

ORGANISMS DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION,Phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of the poorly known genus Spalerosophis (Serpentes: Colubridae),"Spalerosophis Jan, 1865, is a colubrid snake genus distributed in arid and semiarid regions from northwestern Africa to northern India. Six species of Spalerosophis are identified based on traditional morphology; however, there are arguments about their systematic status. We performed the first molecular phylogenetic analyses for this genus using nucleotide sequences of c. 2278 bp from three mitochondrial genes (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and cyt b) to investigate the phylogenetic relationships and historical evolution of the poorly known Spalerosophis species and doubtful populations. We used fossil calibrations for dating divergences. Our phylogenetic analyses clearly showed five separate species with high support values, including S. arenarius, S. atriceps, S. microlepis, S. diadema schirasianus, and S. diadema cliffordii. Bayesian calibrated molecular clock suggested that the genus Spalerosophis diverged from the common ancestor in the Paleogene around 35.28 Mya (25.89-44.66). Our analysis indicated that isolated S. atriceps was separated around 21.72 Mya (10.86-33.04) as the basal diverged species of the genus. This suggested that the species of Spalerosophis probably originated from an ancestor somewhere in the Iranian Plateau and then dispersed to its current geographical range. Spalerosophis arenarius and S. atriceps were identified as the two last diverged members of the genus, separated from S. d. schirasianus during the Middle Miocene about 13.31 Mya (5.52-22.33). These results indicate that the separation of Spalerosophis species coincided with the orogenic events of the Zagros Mountains in western Iran and the Sulaiman Mountains in Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. Their diversification may therefore be the result of vicariance events that promoted their current distribution.

We also performed an analysis of reconstruction of ancestral areas, with particular interest in the first diverging lineages of Encyclia. We used an ad hoc regionalization system designed to fit our distributional Encyclia data to reconstruct the ancestral distribution of the genus and the most relevant nodes. The analyses yielded a moderately well-supported topology with the broadest taxonomic Encyclia sampling yet. Our results indicate the Encyclia adenocarpos complex is monophyletic, highly supported, and sister to a large clade with ca. 95\% of the species of Encyclia included in the analyses and suggest the clade is composed of several related, fundamentally allopatric species distributed along the Pacific slopes of Megamexico, including a novelty here proposed, Encyclia mariaeugeniae, which is closely related to Encyclia enriquearcilae yet differing in several diagnostic characters, such as a narrower central lobe to the labellum. The novelty was assessed as EN under IUCN criteria. We provide a key to the E. adenocarpos clade. Our Encyclia phylogeny identifies several clades displaying strong geographic signal; some of these are discussed in terms of morphology, ecological preferences, and pollination syndromes. The reconstruction of ancestral areas indicates with high probability that the earliest diverging nodes of Encyclia occurred in Megamexico. Floral variation within clades suggests the genus colonized geographical areas and underwent diversifications to occupy novel pollination syndromes in a pattern of allopatric, similar assemblages of syndromes composed of unrelated taxa. We present a preliminary species list of Encyclia and their distributions along the major biogeographic areas to provide a hypothesis of diversity patterns and the biogeographical areas where the species occur.

Studying the phylogeography of endemic and widely distributed species in the Neotropical region is an effective method to describe the evolutionary processes underlying the appearance and the maintenance of species. The two related lineages, Embiratermes neotenicus and its supposed sister species, E. chagresi (Termitidae: Syntermitinae), have been observed in sympatry in the west of the Andes although the literature suggests their geographic separation. To better understand the biogeographical processes and to gain insight into the evolutionary history of these species in this region, we collected the two termite species all around the sympatry zone (Panama, West and East Colombia, Ecuador) and analysed morphological features, mitochondrial (COI, COII, 16S) and nuclear (ITS2, Wg, microsatellite loci) DNA variation. We found mito-nuclear incongruences and admixed individuals in the sympatry zone and few morphometrical differences between lineages. Our analyses of the reproductive system suggest that E. chagresi is also able to reproduce through Asexual Queen Succession like E. neotenicus.

ORGANISMS DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION,A mosaic of conserved and novel modes of gene expression and morphogenesis in mesoderm and muscle formation of a larval bivalve,"The mesoderm gives rise to several key morphological features of bilaterian animals including endoskeletal elements and the musculature. A number of regulatory genes involved in mesoderm and/or muscle formation (e.g., Brachyury (Bra), even-skipped (eve), Mox, myosin II heavy chain (mhc)) have been identified chiefly from chordates and the ecdysozoans Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, but data for non-model protostomes, especially those belonging to the ecdysozoan sister clade, Lophotrochozoa (e.g., flatworms, annelids, mollusks), are only beginning to emerge. Within the lophotrochozoans, Mollusca constitutes the most speciose and diverse phylum. Interestingly, however, information on the morphological and molecular underpinnings of key ontogenetic processes such as mesoderm formation and myogenesis remains scarce even for prominent molluscan sublineages such as the bivalves. Here, we investigated myogenesis and developmental expression of Bra, eve, Mox, and mhc in the quagga mussel Dreissena rostriformis, an invasive freshwater bivalve and an emerging model in invertebrate evodevo. We found that all four genes are expressed during mesoderm formation, but some show additional, individual sites of expression during ontogeny. While Mox and mhc are involved in early myogenesis, eve is also expressed in the embryonic shell field and Bra is additionally present in the foregut. Comparative analysis suggests that Mox has an ancestral role in mesoderm and possibly muscle formation in bilaterians, while Bra and eve are conserved regulators of mesoderm development of nephrozoans (protostomes and deuterostomes). The fully developed Dreissena veliger larva shows a highly complex muscular architecture, supporting a muscular ground pattern of autobranch bivalve larvae that includes at least a velum muscle ring, three or four pairs of velum retractors, one or two pairs of larval retractors, two pairs of foot retractors, a pedal plexus, possibly two pairs of mantle retractors, and the muscles of the pallial line, as well as an anterior and a posterior adductor.

During January-May 2020, we surveyed 146 people on 12 islands to collect information on the habitats preferred by the prehensile-tailed skink, to understand perceptions of the species' conservation status and identify any potential threats. Respondents reported lowland and hill forests as being favoured habitats, with low proportions of respondents identifying coastal and montane forests as suitable habitat. Habitat loss (72\%), hunting (17\%), and predation (6\%) were identified as the main threats. People younger than 30 years of age reported killing the skinks more frequently than did people over the age of 30.

ORYX,Conservation value of vanilla agroecosystems for vertebrate diversity in north-east Madagascar,"As a result of increasing global demand for food, large areas of natural habitat are being converted to agroecosystems to accommodate crop cultivation. This agricultural expansion is most prominent in the tropics, where many rural communities are dependent solely on farming income for their livelihoods. Such agricultural land conversion can have severe implications for local fauna. In this study, we compared vertebrate species diversity between natural forest habitat and three types of vanilla plantations maintained under varying management regimes in northeast Madagascar. We used diurnal and nocturnal transects to survey vertebrate diversity. Natural forest habitat contained the greatest vertebrate species diversity, and had proportionally more threatened and endemic species than all vanilla plantation types. However, we observed a greater number of species and a higher inverse Simpson index in minimally managed vanilla plantations located within or near natural forest compared to intensively managed vanilla plantations. These findings are important and encouraging for animal conservation and sustainable crop cultivation in Madagascar, and suggest that newly created vanilla plantations, and already existing plantations, should endeavour to follow the more traditional, minimalistic management approach to improve sustainability and promote higher faunal diversity.",Agroforestry; animal conservation; biodiversity; habitat management; Madagascar; species richness; vanilla plantation; vertebrate surveys,2023,57,1,10.1017/S0030605321001265,0030-6053,11,94,189,1385,8,25,250,8,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
ORYX,Controversies and hidden risks in biodiversity offsets in critically threatened Canga (ironstone) ecosystems in Brazil,"Canga, or ironstone, ecosystems are hotspots of old-growth plant diversity and highly specialized cave invertebrates. These ancient metalliferous habitats are amongst the most threatened ecosystems because of the destruction caused by large-scale iron ore mining. International debate on biodiversity offsets is increasing because these mechanisms are seen as tools for potentially balancing economic development with conservation biodiversity. Leading mining companies worldwide, including some of the largest iron ore producers in Brazil, are signatories to offset principles and best practices that aim to achieve no net loss of habitats, species or ecosystem functions. We aimed to analyse whether Brazilian legal requirements for biodiversity offsets result in the achievement of conservation outcomes or in elevated threat of extinction in canga ecosystems. We evaluated technical reports that support decision-making related to environmental licensing for iron ore mining and specific offset proposals linked to the Atlantic Forest Act. We found a relevant net loss in canga ecosystems and observed shortcomings related to the equivalency and transparency of offset principles. These deficiencies are mainly related to lax norms and regulations and the absence of an integrated database for accessing information on environmental licensing processes. We argue that both policy flaws and low engagement by the Brazilian mining industry in implementing offset principles have increased the threat of extinction in canga ecosystems.",Brazil; canga ecosystem; critical habitats; environmental licensing; governance; iron mining; risk of extinction,2023,57,1,10.1017/S0030605322000333,0030-6053,15,118,216,1536,7,25,250,8,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes

Despite ecological, behavioural and morphological differences, and different habitat ranges, genetic studies confirm that the two species and hybrids coexist in forest-savannah ecotones. However, the hybrid phenotypes have not yet been described. In this survey we examined whether the phenotypes of the two species and of hybrids can be distinguished. In the first step, we used a machine learning algorithm (K-nearest neighbours) to compare 296 reference images of African elephants from five forest areas and six savannah areas where hybrids have not been recorded, confirming that six morphological criteria can be used to distinguish the species with more than 90\% confidence. In the second step, we analysed 1,408 videos of elephants from 14 camera traps in Sebitoli, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, part of the main hybridization area. We used a multiple correspondence analysis and a species assignment key, highlighting the presence of three categories of phenotypes. Compared to the savannah and forest phenotypes (36.8 and 12.1\%, respectively), the intermediate phenotypes, which could include hybrids, were more frequent (51.1\%). Further studies combining morphology and genetics of the same individuals will be necessary to refine this species assignment key to characterize phenotypes confidently.

ORYX,Species detection framework using automated recording units: a case study of the Critically Endangered Jerdon's courser,"With the advent of automated recording units, bioacoustic monitoring has become a popular tool for the collection of long-term data across extensive landscapes. Such methods involve two main components: hardware for audio data acquisition and software for analysis. In the acoustic monitoring of threatened species, a species-specific framework is often essential. Jerdon's courser Rhinoptilus bitorquatus is a Critically Endangered nocturnal bird endemic to a small region of the Eastern Ghats of India, last reported in 2008. Here we describe a reproducible and scalable acoustic detection framework for the species, comparing several commonly available hardware and detection methods and using existing software. We tested this protocol by collecting 24,349 h of data during 5 months. We analysed the data with two commercially available sound analysis programmes, following an analysis pipeline created for this species. Although we did not detect vocalizations of Jerdon's courser, this study provides a framework using a combination of hardware and software for future research that other conservation practitioners can implement. Vocal mimicry can aid or confound in detection and we highlight the potential role of mimicry in the detection of such threatened species.

During 6-8 August 2019, at a time of year when canopy cover is minimal, we surveyed marsh deer using Phantom 4 Pro UAVs along 94 transects totalling 127.8 km and 8.6 km(2) (8.1\% of the study area). The 5,506 photographs obtained were manually checked by us and by a group of 39 trained volunteers, following a standardized protocol. We detected a total of 58 marsh deer, giving an estimated density of 6.90 individuals per km(2) (95\% CI 5.26-8.54), which extrapolates to 559-908 individuals in our 113.6 km(2) study area.

In this study, we surveyed 155 past participants of training in facilitating species conservation planning processes given by the Conservation Planning Specialist Group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission. Based on a recently developed theory of change for the training, we examined how and to what extent the training contributed to the desired outcome of increasing trainees' capacity for leading the design and facilitation of species conservation planning processes. Our results indicate that recall of training content, self-efficacy (an individual's belief they can complete a specific task or behaviour successfully) and peer network participation had significant impacts on the outcome of applying training content in the workplace. Furthermore, our results suggest that self-efficacy played a highly influential role in trainees' participation in species conservation planning post-training. The implications of this research point to designing conservation training that considers not only the skills and knowledge to be gained by learners but also the strategies that enhance trainees' self-efficacy in applying new skills and knowledge and in establishing peer networks to support trainees in turning training objectives into realities.",Capacity building; conservation; peer networks; self-efficacy; theory of change; wildlife,2022,56,5,10.1017/S0030605322000023,0030-6053,18,127,204,1453,6,25,250,8,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,"A test of Bergmann's rule in the Early Triassic: latitude, body size, and sampling in Lystrosaurus","The ecogeographic rule known as Bergmann's rule suggests that there is a positive relationship between body size and latitude when comparing closely related taxa. The underlying mechanism or mechanisms to explain this pattern vary as widely as the taxa that seem to follow it, which has led to skepticism over whether Bergmann's rule should be considered a rule at all. Despite this, Bergmann's rule is widespread among modern birds, mammals, beetles, and some amphibians, but far fewer extinct taxa have been subjected to tests of Bergmann's rule. To examine whether Bergmann's rule is detected in extinct taxa, we compared body-size proxies in Lystrosaurus recovered from Early Triassic-aged strata in Antarctica, South Africa, India, and China. Our results reveal that average body size is largest at mid-northern paleolatitudes (similar to 45 degrees N) instead of the highest southern paleolatitudes (similar to 70 degrees S). Additionally, maximum body size is consistent across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, indicating that Bergmann's rule did not apply for Lystrosaurus during the Early Triassic. To test potential sample size biases in our results, we used rarefaction and subsampling to show that only the Karoo Basin is well sampled and that large individuals are exceedingly rare, except in the Turpan-Junggar Basin of Xinjiang, China. Taken together, our results suggest that Lystrosaurus had the potential to reach large body sizes in each of the latitudinally widespread geologic basins studied here, but that local conditions may have allowed individuals at mid-northern paleolatitudes a greater chance of reaching a large size compared with southern congeners that suffered increased mortality when young or at a small size.",NA,2023,49,1,10.1017/pab.2022.25,0094-8373,16,98,266,1750,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,"Automatic taxonomic identification based on the Fossil Image Dataset (>415,000 images) and deep convolutional neural networks","The rapid and accurate taxonomic identification of fossils is of great significance in paleontology, biostratigraphy, and other fields. However, taxonomic identification is often labor-intensive and tedious, and the requisition of extensive prior knowledge about a taxonomic group also requires long-term training. Moreover, identification results are often inconsistent across researchers and communities. Accordingly, in this study, we used deep learning to support taxonomic identification. We used web crawlers to collect the Fossil Image Dataset (FID) via the Internet, obtaining 415,339 images belonging to 50 fossil clades. Then we trained three powerful convolutional neural networks on a high-performance workstation. The Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture achieved an average accuracy of 0.90 in the test dataset when transfer learning was applied. The clades of microfossils and vertebrate fossils exhibited the highest identification accuracies of 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. In contrast, clades of sponges, bryozoans, and trace fossils with various morphologies or with few samples in the dataset exhibited a performance below 0.80. Visual explanation methods further highlighted the discrepancies among different fossil clades and suggested similarities between the identifications made by machine classifiers and taxonomists. Collecting large paleontological datasets from various sources, such as the literature, digitization of dark data, citizen-science data, and public data from the Internet may further enhance deep learning methods and their adoption. Such developments will also possibly lead to image-based systematic taxonomy to be replaced by machine-aided classification in the future.

PALEOBIOLOGY,Changing diets over time: knock-on effects of marine megafauna overexploitation on their competitors in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean,"This study compares the delta N-15 values and the trophic position of two seabird species throughout the late Holocene in three regions in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean to assess the hypothesis that the decimation of megafauna led to changes in the trophic position of mesopredators. Modern and ancient mollusk shells were also analyzed to account for changes in the isotopic baseline through time. Results revealed that modern Magellanic penguins have higher delta N-15 values than their ancient conspecifics in the three regions, after controlling for changes in the isotopic baseline. This was also true for modern Imperial shags compared with ancient unidentified cormorants/shags from the two areas where ancient specimens were recovered (southern Patagonia and the Beagle Channel). Such temporal variability might be caused by three non-mutually exclusive processes: decreased availability of pelagic squat lobster resulting from decreasing primary productivity through the late Holocene, increased availability of small fishes resulting from the sequential depletion of other piscivores (South American fur seal and sea lion and Argentine hake) since the late eighteenth century, and modification of the migratory patterns of Magellanic penguins. Although disentangling the relative contribution of all those processes is impossible at this time, the results reported here demonstrate that the ecology of Magellanic penguins and Imperial shags has undergone major changes since the late Holocene.",NA,2023,49,1,10.1017/pab.2022.19,0094-8373,18,135,217,1505,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Convergence and constraint in the cranial evolution of mosasaurid reptiles and early cetaceans,"The repeated return of tetrapods to aquatic life provides some of the best-known examples of convergent evolution. One comparison that has received relatively little focus is that of mosasaurids (a group of Late Cretaceous squamates) and archaic cetaceans (the ancestors of modern whales and dolphins), both of which show high levels of craniodental disparity, similar initial trends in locomotory evolution, and global distributions. Here we investigate convergence in skull ecomorphology during the initial aquatic radiations of these groups. A series of functionally informative ratios were calculated from 38 species, with ordination techniques used to reconstruct patterns of functional ecomorphospace occupation. The earliest fully aquatic members of each clade occupied different regions of ecomorphospace, with basilosaurids and early russellosaurines exhibiting marked differences in cranial functional morphology. Subsequent ecomorphological trajectories notably diverge: mosasaurids radiated across ecomorphospace with no clear pattern and numerous reversals, whereas cetaceans notably evolved toward shallower, more elongated snouts, perhaps as an adaptation for capturing smaller prey. Incomplete convergence between the two groups is present among megapredatory and longirostrine forms, suggesting stronger selection on cranial function in these two ecomorphologies. Our study highlights both the similarities and divergences in craniodental evolutionary trajectories between archaic cetaceans and mosasaurids, with convergences transcending their deeply divergent phylogenetic affinities.",NA,2023,49,2,10.1017/pab.2022.27,0094-8373,13,94,206,1603,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Developmental plasticity in deep time: a window to population ecological inference,"Developmental plasticity, where traits change state in response to environmental cues, is well studied in modern populations. It is also suspected to play a role in macroevolutionary dynamics, but due to a lack of long-term records, the frequency of plasticity-led evolution in deep time remains unknown. Populations are dynamic entities, yet their representation in the fossil record is a static snapshot of often isolated individuals. Here, we apply for the first time contemporary integral projection models (IPMs) to fossil data to link individual development with expected population variation. IPMs describe the effects of individual growth in discrete steps on long-term population dynamics. We parameterize the models using modern and fossil data of the planktonic foraminifer Trilobatus sacculifer. Foraminifera grow by adding chambers in discrete stages and die at reproduction, making them excellent case studies for IPMs. Our results predict that somatic growth rates have almost twice as much influence on population dynamics than survival and more than eight times more influence than reproduction, suggesting that selection would primarily target somatic growth as the major determinant of fitness. As numerous paleobiological systems record growth rate increments in single genetic individuals and imaging technologies are increasingly available, our results open up the possibility of evidence-based inference of developmental plasticity spanning macroevolutionary dynamics. Given the centrality of ecology in paleobiological thinking, our model is one approach to help bridge eco-evolutionary scales while directing attention toward the most relevant life-history traits to measure.",NA,2023,49,2,10.1017/pab.2022.26,0094-8373,11,82,239,1700,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Dispersals from the West Tethys as the source of the Indo-West Pacific diversity hotspot in comatulid crinoids,"Conspicuous centers of biodiversity are frequently attributed to local conditions that promote speciation or resistance to extinction, but recent diversification studies indicate this mode of explanation might not be very general, so it may be fruitful to revisit the role of dispersal in concentrating biodiversity. Here we consider the processes underlying the marine diversity hotspot in the Indo-West Pacific among comatulid crinoids, suspension-feeding echinoderms conspicuous on modern tropical reefs. We used ancestral-range reconstruction on a phylogeny of extant crinoids, assembled a new occurrence database of fossil comatulids and interrogated it with probabilistic preservational models, and developed a morphological character matrix to estimate the relationships among living and fossil comatulids. Ancestral-range reconstruction on a phylogeny of extant comatulids recovers an origin outside the Indo-Pacific and elevated dispersal into it. A new occurrence database records the comatulid clade spreading out gradually from origin in the Early Jurassic of the West Tethys. Comatulids do not appear in their modern hotspot until the Oligocene, and taphonomic analyses show these results cannot be explained solely as a result of inadequate sampling in Asia and Oceania. Finally, phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that deeply nested crown-group comatulids had originated before the clade became well established in the East Tethys, implying many independent dispersals into the modern hotspot. These consilient results suggest a biodiversity hotspot that owes its existence to dispersals out of the ancient West Tethys rather than to elevated in situ diversification.",NA,2023,49,1,10.1017/pab.2022.23,0094-8373,17,110,235,1681,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Examining competition during the agnathan/gnathostome transition using distance-based morphometrics,"The rise of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and extinction of nearly all jawless vertebrates (agnathans) is one of the most important transitions in vertebrate evolution, but the causes are poorly understood. Competition between agnathans and gnathostomes during the Devonian period is the most commonly hypothesized cause; however, no formal attempts to test this hypothesis have been made. Generally, competition between species increases as morphological similarity increases; therefore, this study uses the largest to date morphometric comparison of Silurian and Devonian agnathan and gnathostome groups to determine which groups were most and least likely to have competed. Five agnathan groups (Anaspida, Heterostraci, Osteostraci, Thelodonti, and Furcacaudiformes) were compared with five gnathostome groups (Acanthodii, Actinopterygii, Chondrichthyes, Placodermi, and Sarcopterygii) including taxa from most major orders. Morphological dissimilarity was measured by Gower's dissimilarity coefficient, and the differences between agnathan and gnathostome body forms across early vertebrate morphospace were compared using principal coordinate analysis. Our results indicate competition between some agnathans and gnathostomes is plausible, but not all agnathan groups were similar to gnathostomes. Furcacaudiformes (fork-tailed thelodonts) are distinct from other early vertebrate groups and the least likely to have competed with other groups.",NA,2023,49,2,10.1017/pab.2022.32,0094-8373,9,99,189,1452,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Geographic and temporal morphological stasis in the latest Cretaceous ammonoid Discoscaphites iris from the US Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plains,"We examine temporal and spatial variation in morphology of the ammonoid cephalopod Discoscaphites iris using a large dataset from multiple localities in the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plains, spanning a distance of 2000 km along the paleoshoreline. Our results suggest that the fossil record of D. iris is consistent with no within-species net accumulation of phyletic evolutionary change across morphological traits or the lifetime of this species. Correlations between some traits and paleoenvironmental conditions as well as changes in the coefficient of variation may support limited population-scale ecophenotypic plasticity; however, where stratigraphic data are available, no directional changes in morphology occur before the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary. This is consistent with models of ``dynamic{''} evolutionary stasis. Combined with knowledge of life-history traits and paleoecology of scaphitid ammonoids, specifically a short planktonic phase after hatching followed by transition to a nektobenthic adult stage, these data suggest that scaphitids had significant potential for rapid morphological change in conjunction with limited dispersal capacity. It is therefore likely that evolutionary mode in the Scaphitidae (and potentially across the broader ammonoid clade) follows a model of cladogenesis wherein a dynamic morphological stasis is periodically interrupted by more substantial evolutionary change at speciation events. Finally, the lack of temporal changes in our data suggest that global environmental changes had a limited effect on the morphology of ammonoid faunas during the latest Cretaceous.",NA,2023,49,1,10.1017/pab.2022.15,0094-8373,20,143,231,1676,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Interpretation of fossil embryos requires reasonable assessment of developmental age,"Dinosaur embryos cause a lot of excitement in the scientific literature and are often widely reported because of the general public's interest in dinosaur biology. Well-preserved, articulated oviraptorosaur embryos in eggs are usually interpreted as representing a stage of development close to hatching because of their large size and good level of skeletal ossification. Based on this evidence, a recent report suggested that the position of the one embryo's head was reminiscent of an avian-like hatching position. Here we explore how the developmental stage of well-preserved oviraptorosaur embryos can be estimated, rather than assumed. This will help in our understanding of their developmental biology and its evolutionary consequences. Using quantitative methods and comparison with modern crocodilian embryos, we show that all articulated oviraptorosaur embryos are small relative to the egg and most likely at a stage of development equivalent to around 50\%-60\% of the developmental period, that is, not even close to hatching. This conclusion is supported by the fact that many elements of the crocodilian skeleton are well ossified many weeks before hatching and the position of oviraptorosaur embryos' heads was also comparable to a crocodilian embryo many days before hatching. Misunderstandings about the stage of the developmental biology of these well-preserved oviraptorosaur embryos hampers our understanding of the true nature of their reproductive biology. We urge a more conservative approach to their interpretation. This is important, because misunderstandings in the minds of the public about dinosaur biology are hard to counter once poorly evidenced ideas have been reported around the world.",NA,2023,49,1,10.1017/pab.2022.21,0094-8373,10,84,253,1721,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Latitudinal influences on bryozoan calcification through the Paleozoic,"Bryozoans are active non-phototrophic biomineralizers that precipitate their calcareous skeletons in seawater. Carbonate saturation states varied temporally and spatially in Paleozoic oceans, and we used the Bryozoan Skeletal Index (BSI) to investigate whether bryozoan calcification was controlled by seawater chemistry in Paleozoic trepostome and cryptostome bryozoans. Our results show that cryptostome bryozoan genera were influenced by ocean chemistry throughout the Paleozoic and precipitated the most calcite at lower latitudes, where carbonate saturation states are generally higher, and less in midlatitudes, where carbonate will be relatively undersaturated. Trepostome bryozoan genera show a similar but weaker trend for the Ordovician to Devonian, suggesting that, like the cryptostomes, they were unable to metabolically overcome falling saturation states and simply precipitated less robust skeletons at higher latitudes. Carboniferous to Triassic trepostomes differ, however, and show a trend toward increased calcification at higher latitudes, indicating an ability to overcome unfavorable carbonate saturation states. Analysis of Permian trepostomes at the species level indicates this is most pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere, where calcification is matched by increased feeding capacity. It is proposed that this increased feeding capacity allowed trepostomes to metabolically overcome unfavorable carbonate saturation states. The differing responses of trepostome and cryptostome bryozoans to carbonate saturation states suggest that bryozoans should not be considered as a single group in marine extinctions linked to ocean chemistry changes. Likewise, it would suggest that modern stenolaemate and gymnolaemate bryozoans should be treated separately when considering their response to modern ocean chemistry changes.",NA,2023,49,2,10.1017/pab.2022.31,0094-8373,8,70,244,1843,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Reassessing growth and mortality estimates for the Ordovician trilobite Triarthrus eatoni,"A length-frequency sample (n = 295) from a fossil population of the Ordovician trilobite Triarthrus eatoni Hall, 1838, assembled and analyzed by J. L. Cisne in 1973 is here reexamined using methods of length-frequency analysis commonly used in fishery science and marine biology. Theoretical considerations and the empirical data at hand suggest that the growth of T. eatoni was not ``linear,{''} but asymptotic, as is the growth of most Recent marine invertebrates. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function (L-infinity = 41 mm, K = 0.29 yr(-1)) suggest that T. eatoni, which apparently lived in a challenging environment, grew somewhat more slowly than the extant marine isopod Ceratoserolis trilobitoides (Eights, 1833), used here as Recent analogue to T. eatoni. This trilobite probably lived up to 10 years, rather than the suggested 4 years, and its mortality rate was 15\%-20\% per year rather than 30\%-40\% per year. These represent the first estimates of trilobite absolute growth characteristics using methods known to accurately model growth in extant water-breathing ectotherms. These provide a baseline for trilobite growth that can be used to make inferences about growth in other species. The approach used here may also be applied to other trilobites for which suitable length-frequency data exist.",NA,2023,49,1,10.1017/pab.2022.22,0094-8373,11,89,204,1327,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Relative species abundance and population densities of the past: developing multispecies occupancy models for fossil data,"The number of individuals of species varies, but estimating abundance, given incomplete and biased sampling in both contemporary and fossilized communities, is challenging. Here, we describe a new occupancy model in a hierarchical Bayesian framework with random effects, in which multispecies occupancy and detection are modeled as a means to estimate relative species abundance and relative population densities. The modeling framework is suited for temporal samples of fossil communities with repeated sampling including multiple species with similar preservation potential. We demonstrate our modeling framework using a fossil community of benthic organisms to estimate relative species abundance dynamics and changing relative population densities of focal species in nine (geological) time intervals over 2.3 Myr. We also explore potential explanatory factors (paleoenvironmental proxies) and temporal autocorrelation that could provide extra information on unsampled time intervals. The modeling framework is applicable across a wide range of questions on species-level dynamics in paleoecological community settings.",NA,2023,49,1,10.1017/pab.2022.17,0094-8373,16,121,151,1123,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Small but mighty: how overlooked small species maintain community structure through middle Eocene climate change,"Understanding current and future biodiversity responses to changing climate is pivotal as anthropogenic climate change continues. This understanding is complicated by the multitude of available metrics to quantify dynamics and by biased sampling protocols. Here, we investigate the impact of sampling protocol strategies using a data-rich fossil record to calculate effective diversity using Hill numbers for the first time on Paleogene planktonic foraminifera. We sample 22,830 individual tests, in two different size classes, across a 7 Myr time slice of the middle Eocene featuring a major transient warming event, the middle Eocene climatic optimum (MECO; similar to 40 Ma), at study sites in the midlatitude North Atlantic. Using generalized additive models, we investigate community responses to climatic fluctuations. After correcting for arty effects of fossil fragmentation, we show a peak in generic diversity in the early and middle stages of the MECO as well as divergent trajectories between the typical size-selected community (>180 mu m) and a broader assemblage, including smaller genera (>63 mu m). Assemblages featuring smaller genera are more resilient to the climatic fluctuations of the MECO than those assemblages that feature only larger genera, maintaining their community structure at the reference Hill numbers for Shannon's and Simpson's indices. These results raise fundamental questions about how communities respond to climate excursions. In addition, our results emphasize the need to design studies with the aim of collecting the most inclusive data possible to allow detection of community changes and determine which species are likely to dominate future environments.",NA,2023,49,1,10.1017/pab.2022.24,0094-8373,15,112,249,1702,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,The effect of siliceous sponge deposition on Permian paleocommunity structure,"A dramatic shift from carbonate-rich to chert-rich marine strata occurred during the Permian and is frequently attributed to the increased activity of siliceous sponges and their biosiliceous sedimentation. The first-order ecologic consequences of this transition, if any, remain opaque. We analyze fossil occurrence data from the Phosphoria Basin (western North America) to test whether the presence of siliceous sponges, which are correlated with basin-wide chert strata, influenced the recruitment of benthic fauna. Using published lithologic descriptions, we categorized fossil collections by formation, facies, and lithology and used these data to code detrended correspondence analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations. We also analyzed the clustering of taxa into faunal units termed biofacies. Results from these analyses indicate that fossil collections occurring in chert and carbonate are closely associated in faunal composition and community structure. These collections preferentially occur in the inner- to mid-ramp facies, in agreement with previous studies. Although largely similar in composition, collections of chert and carbonate lithology exhibit differences in the frequency and abundance of accessory brachiopod taxa (e.g., Composita and Hustedia), possibly a result of greater biosiliceous sedimentary input.",NA,2023,49,1,10.1017/pab.2022.18,0094-8373,10,77,182,1351,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,The preservation of cause and effect in the rock record,"Evolutionary events may impact the geological carbon cycle via transient imbalances in silicate weathering, and such events have been implicated as causes of glaciations, mass extinctions, and oceanic anoxia. However, suggested evolutionary causes often substantially predate the environmental effects to which they are linked-problematic when carbon cycle perturbations must be resolved in less than a million years to maintain Earth's habitability. What is more, the geochemical signatures of such perturbations are recorded as they occur in widely distributed marine sedimentary rocks that have been densely sampled for important intervals in Earth history, whereas the fossil record-particularly on land-is governed by the availability of sedimentary basins that are patchy in both space and time, necessitating lags between the origination of an evolutionary lineage and its earliest occurrence in the fossil record. Here, we present a simple model of the impact of preservational filtering on sampling to show that an evolutionary event that causes an environmental perturbation via weathering imbalance should not appear earlier in the rock record than the perturbation itself and, if anything, should appear later rather than simultaneously. The Devonian Hangenberg glaciation provides an example of how evolutionary events might be more fruitfully considered as potential causes of environmental perturbations. Just as the last samplings of species lost in mass extinction are expected to come before the true environmental event, first appearance should be expected to postdate the geological expression of a lineage's environmental impact with important implications for our reading of Earth history.",NA,2023,49,2,10.1017/pab.2022.33,0094-8373,10,55,245,1711,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,A biased fossil record can preserve reliable phylogenetic signal,"The fossil record is notoriously imperfect and biased in representation, hindering our ability to place fossil specimens into an evolutionary context. For groups with fossil records mostly consisting of disarticulated parts (e.g., vertebrates, echinoderms, plants), the limited morphological information preserved sparks concerns about whether fossils retain reliable evidence of phylogenetic relationships and lends uncertainty to analyses of diversification, paleobiogeography, and biostratigraphy in Earth's history. To address whether a fragmentary past can be trusted, we need to assess whether incompleteness affects the quality of phylogenetic information contained in fossil data. Herein, we characterize skeletal incompleteness bias in a large dataset (6585 specimens; 14,417 skeletal elements) of fossil squamates (lizards, snakes, amphisbaenians, and mosasaurs). We show that jaws + palatal bones, vertebrae, and ribs appear more frequently in the fossil record than other parts of the skeleton. This incomplete anatomical representation in the fossil record is biased against regions of the skeleton that contain the majority of morphological phylogenetic characters used to assess squamate evolutionary relationships. Despite this bias, parsimony- and model-based comparative analyses indicate that the most frequently occurring parts of the skeleton in the fossil record retain similar levels of phylogenetic signal as parts of the skeleton that are rarer. These results demonstrate that the biased squamate fossil record contains reliable phylogenetic information and support our ability to place incomplete fossils in the tree of life.",NA,2022,48,3,10.1017/pab.2021.45,0094-8373,9,64,226,1651,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,A new approach for investigating spatial relationships of ichnofossils: a case study of Ediacaran-Cambrian animal traces,"Trace fossils record foraging behaviors, the search for resources in patchy environments, of animals in the rock record. Quantification of the strength, density, and nature of foraging behaviors enables the investigation of how these may have changed through time. Here, we present a novel approach to explore such patterns using spatial point process analyses to quantify the scale and strength of ichnofossil spatial distributions on horizontal bedding planes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we use two samples from the terminal Ediacaran Shibantan Member in South China (between 551 and 543 Ma) and the early Cambrian Nagaur Sandstone in northwestern India (between 539 and 509 Ma). We find that ichnotaxa on both surfaces exhibited significant nonhomogeneous lateral patterns, with distinct levels of heterogeneity exhibited by different types of trace fossils. In the Shibantan, two ichnotaxa show evidence for mutual positive aggregation over a shared resource, suggesting the ability to focus on optimal resource areas. Trace fossils from the Nagaur Sandstone exhibit more sophisticated foraging behavior, with greater niche differentiation. Critically, mark correlation functions highlight significant spatial autocorrelation of trace fossil orientations, demonstrating the greater ability of these Cambrian tracemakers to focus on optimal patches. Despite potential limitations, these analyses hint at changes in the development and optimization of foraging at the Ediacaran/Cambrian transition and highlight the potential of spatial point process analysis to tease apart subtle differences in behavior in the trace fossil record.",NA,2022,48,4,10.1017/pab.2022.16,0094-8373,16,120,235,1653,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Accounting for uncertainty from zero inflation and overdispersion in paleoecological studies of predation using a hierarchical Bayesian framework,"The effects of overdispersion and zero inflation (e.g., poor model fits) can result in misinterpretation in studies using count data. These effects have not been evaluated in paleoecological studies of predation and are further complicated by preservational bias and time averaging. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for uncertainty from overdispersion and zero inflation in estimates of specimen and predation trace counts. We demonstrate its application using published data on drilling predators and their prey in time-averaged death assemblages from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Our results indicate that estimates of predation frequencies are underestimated when zero inflation is not considered, and this effect is likely compounded by removal of individuals and predation traces via preservational bias. Time averaging likely reduces zero inflation via accumulation of rare taxa and events; however, it increases the uncertainty in comparisons between assemblages by introducing variability in sampling effort. That is, there is an analytical cost with time-averaged count data, manifesting as broader confidence regions. Ecological inferences in paleoecology can be strengthened by accounting for the uncertainty inherent to paleoecological count data and the sampling processes by which they are generated.",NA,2022,48,1,10.1017/pab.2021.27,0094-8373,18,145,189,1343,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,An abundance- and morphology-based similarity index,"Classic similarity indices measure community resemblance in terms of incidence (the number of shared species) and abundance (the extent to which the shared species are an equivalently large component of the ecosystem). Here we describe a general method for increasing the amount of information contained in the output of these indices and describe a new ``soft{''} ecological similarity measure (here called ``soft Chao-Jaccard similarity{''}). The new measure quantifies community resemblance in terms of shared species, while accounting for intraspecific variation in abundance and morphology between samples. We demonstrate how our proposed measure can reconstruct short ecological gradients using random samples of taxa, recognizing patterns that are completely missed by classic measures of similarity. To demonstrate the utility of our new index, we reconstruct a morphological gradient driven by river flow velocity using random samples drawn from simulated and real-world data. Results suggest that the new index can be used to recognize complex short ecological gradients in settings where only information about specimens is available. We include open-source R code for calculating the proposed index.",NA,2022,48,2,10.1017/pab.2021.33,0094-8373,6,51,174,1211,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Applying the Prigogine view of dissipative systems to the major transitions in evolution,"Ilya Prigogine's trinomial concept is, he argued, applicable to many complex dissipative systems, from physics to biology and even to social systems. For Prigogine, this trinomial-functions, structure, fluctuations-was intended to capture the feedback-rich relations between upper and lower levels in these systems. The main novelty of his vision was his view of causation, in which the causal arrow runs downward from dissipative structures to their components or functions. Following this insight, some physicists and biophysicists are beginning to apply terms formerly used mainly in biology, such as evolution, adaptation, learning, and life-like behavior, to physical and chemical nonequilibrium systems. Here, instead, we apply Prigogine's view to biology, in particular to evolution, and especially the major transitions in evolution (MTE), arguing that at least the hierarchical transitions-the transitions in individuality-follow a trajectory anticipated by the trinomial. In this trajectory, formerly free-living organisms are transformed into ``functions{''} within a larger organic ``structure.{''} The Prigogine view also predicts that, consistent with available data, the increase in number of hierarchical levels in organisms should accelerate over time. Finally, it predicts that, on geological timescales, ecosystems and Gaia in particular will tend to ``de-Darwinize{''} or ``machinify{''} their component organisms.",NA,2022,48,4,10.1017/pab.2022.7,0094-8373,13,88,194,1434,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Bivalve body-size distribution through the Late Triassic mass extinction event,"The synergic relationship between physiology, ecology, and evolutionary process makes the body-size distribution (BSD) an essential component of the community ecology. Body size is highly susceptible to environmental change, and extreme upheavals, such as during a mass extinction event, could exert drastic changes on a taxon's BSD. It has been hypothesized that the Late Triassic mass extinction event (LTE) was triggered by intense global warming, linked to massive volcanic activity associated with the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. We test the effects of the LTE on the BSD of fossil bivalve assemblages from three study sites spanning the Triassic/Jurassic boundary in the United Kingdom. Our results show that the effects of the LTE were rapid and synchronous across sites, and the BSDs of the bivalves record drastic changes associated with species turnover. No phylogenetic signal of size selectivity was recorded, although semi-infaunal species were apparently most susceptible to change. Each size class had the same likelihood of extinction during the LTE, which resulted in a platykurtic BSD with negative skew. The immediate postextinction assemblage exhibits a leptokurtic BSD, although with negative skew, wherein surviving species and newly appearing small-sized colonizers exhibit body sizes near the modal size. Recovery was relatively rapid (similar to 100 kyr), and larger bivalves began to appear during the pre-Planorbis Zone, despite recurrent dysoxic /anoxic conditions. This study demonstrates how a mass extinction acts across the size spectrum in bivalves and shows how BSDs emerge from evolutionary and ecological processes.",NA,2022,48,3,10.1017/pab.2021.38,0094-8373,10,78,243,1659,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,Carbonate shelf development and early Paleozoic benthic diversity in Baltica: a hierarchical diversity partitioning approach using brachiopod data,"The Ordovician-Silurian (similar to 485-419 Ma) was a time of considerable evolutionary upheaval, encompassing both great evolutionary diversification and one of the first major mass extinctions. The Ordovician diversification coincided with global climatic cooling and paleocontinental collision, the ecological impacts of which were mediated by region-specific processes including substrate changes, biotic invasions, and tectonic movements. From the Sandbian-Katian (similar to 453 Ma) onward, an extensive carbonate shelf developed in the eastern Baltic paleobasin in response to a tectonic shift to tropical latitudes and an increase in the abundance of calcareous macroorganisms. We quantify the contributions of environmental differentiation and temporal turnover to regional diversity through the Ordovician and Silurian, using brachiopod occurrences from the more shallow-water facies belts of the eastern Baltic paleobasin, an epicontinental sea on the Baltica paleocontinent. The results are consistent with carbonate shelf development as a driver of Ordovician regional diversification, both by enhancing broadscale differentiation between shallow- and deep-marine environments and by generating heterogeneous carbonate environments that allowed increasing numbers of brachiopod genera to coexist. However, temporal turnover also contributed significantly to apparent regional diversity, particularly in the Middle-Late Ordovician.",NA,2022,48,1,10.1017/pab.2021.3,0094-8373,18,146,185,1443,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Here we inferred the thermometabolic regime of two neosuchian groups, Goniopholididae (Early Jurassic to Late Cretaceous) and Dyrosauridae (middle Cretaceous to late Eocene), close relatives of extant crocodilians, in order to elucidate the evolutionary pattern across Metasuchia (Early Jurassic to the present), a clade comprising Neosuchia (Early Jurassic to the present) and Notosuchia (Middle Jurassic until the late Miocene). We propose a new integrative approach combining geochemical analyses to infer body temperature from the stable oxygen isotope composition of tooth phosphate and paleohistology and phylogenetic comparative methods to infer resting metabolic rates and red blood cell dimensions. dagger Dyrosaurus and dagger Goniopholis share with extant crocodilians similar lifestyles, body forms, bone tissue organization, body temperatures, metabolic rates, and red blood cell dimensions.

PALEOBIOLOGY,Developmental change during a speciation event: evidence from planktic foraminifera,"Studies in extant populations have shown that plasticity in developmental trajectories can contribute to the origin of novel traits and species divergence via the expression of previously cryptic variation in response to environmental change. Finding evidence for plasticity-led evolution in the fossil record remains challenging due to the poor preservation of developmental stages in many organisms. Planktic foraminifera are ideally suited for addressing this knowledge gap, because adult organisms in species in which development has been studied retain information about all the ontogenetic stages they have undergone. Here we map changes in the developmental trajectories of 68 specimens in the Globorotalia plesiotumida-tumida lineage of planktic foraminifera from the late Miocene until Recent using high-resolution computer tomography techniques. Our unique dataset shows that the transition from the ancestral G. plesiotumida to the descendant G. tumida is preceded by an increased variability in total cumulative volume-an important indicator of reproductive success in this taxon. We also find that the transition interval is marked by a distinct shift in developmental trajectory, which supports a rapid lineage division rather than gradual change. We suggest that high levels of plasticity-particularly in the early stages of development-have contributed to divergence in the ancestral morphology when subjected to a global cooling trend in the late Miocene. The large variation in developmental trajectories that we uncover within our samples emphasizes the need for high-throughput approaches in studies of ontogenetic change in the fossil record.",NA,2022,48,1,10.1017/pab.2021.26,0094-8373,10,83,236,1663,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PALEOBIOLOGY,"Dietary and body-mass reconstruction of the Miocene neotropical bat Notonycteris magdalenensis (Phyllostomidae) from La Venta, Colombia","With 14 species recorded, the Miocene La Venta bat fauna is the most diverse bat paleocommunity in South America. It includes the oldest plant-visiting bat in the New World and some of the earliest representatives of the extant families Phyllostomidae, Thyropteridae, and Noctilionidae. La Venta's Notonycteris magdalenensis is an extinct member of the subfamily Phyllostominae, a group of modern Neotropical animalivorous bats, and is commonly included in studies of the evolution of Neotropical bats, but aspects of its biology remain unclear. In this study, we used multivariate dental topography analysis (DTA) to reconstruct the diet of N. magdalenensis by quantitatively comparing measures of molar complexity with those of 25 modern noctilionoid species representing all major dietary habits in bats. We found clear differences in molar complexity between dietary guilds, indicating that DTA is potentially an informative tool to study bat ecomorphology. Our results suggest N. magdalenensis was probably an omnivore or insectivore, rather than a carnivore like its modern relatives Chrotopterus auritus and Vampyrum spectrum. Also, we reconstructed the body mass of N. magdalenensis to be similar to 95 g, larger than most insectivorous bats, but smaller than the largest carnivorous bat (V. spectrum). Our results confirm that N. magdalenensis was not a specialized carnivore. It remains to be demonstrated that the specialized carnivory ecological niche was occupied by the same lineage of phyllostomines from at least the middle Miocene. Combining our diet and body-mass reconstructions, we suggest that N. magdalenensis exhibits morphological pre-adaptations crucial for the evolution of specialized carnivory.",NA,2022,48,1,10.1017/pab.2021.21,0094-8373,16,135,251,1722,NA,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
PEOPLE AND NATURE,An international assessment of the barriers influencing the effectiveness of island ecosystem management,"Island ecosystems are disproportionally impacted by biodiversity loss and as such their effective management is critical to global conservation efforts. Practitioners world-wide work to manage island sites and species to conserve them, but various day-to-day barriers compromise these efforts, reducing management effectiveness and preventing local and potentially even national biodiversity targets from being met. Identifying the most important barriers that currently impede effective island conservation could streamline investment to focus on cost-efficient interventions that better reflect realities on the ground and the need to address barriers under substantial time and budget constraints. A survey of 360 practitioners working in island ecosystem management across 77 countries was conducted. The three most common barriers perceived by practitioners to prevent them from achieving more effective management are: low staff capacity; difficulties turning data into useful information for management (including lack of capacity and time to analyse data); and lack of a research and management strategy. Practitioners' perceptions of national-level management effectiveness were mostly associated with their perception of governance issues, the presence/absence of research and management strategies and their experience of collaboration outcomes. Practitioners' experience of staffing and monitoring programme issues was important in shaping their perception of management effectiveness within the organisation(s) they worked with. Despite the indisputable need for transformative change to address the underlying causes of many of these barriers, more immediate and direct investment in strengthening the people and systems that are at the frontline of preventing biodiversity loss on islands is needed to bridge these barriers and achieve more effective management of island ecosystems.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,Coastal transformations and connections: Revealing values through the community voice method,"A wealth of evidence suggests an important relationship between nature and human health and well-being and this appears to hold particular resonance for coastal environments. Notably, this relationship has been explored in assessments of ecosystem services, or the benefits that people derive from nature. In this paper, we extend the debate to encompass ideas around relational values which considers that human well-being is derived from relationships with nature rather than being solely delivered as the benefits commonly suggested in the ecosystem services literature. The paper draws on conceptual ideas around relational values, sense of place and environmental justice to understand the values and importance of coastal environments for people. These value concepts are explored through detailed narratives revealed by participants in two case study UK coastal locations, using a form of civic dialogue and videography approach called Community Voice Method (CVM). We find that despite levels of relative deprivation in our case study locations, interviewees express values which are striking in terms of the depth of care felt; values which are `time-deepened' and shaped not only by what people do and are able to do, but also by personal histories and memories which remain strong despite material changes and transformations in people's lives and the places they live. The CVM method in addition provides a practical approach for creating deliberative spaces to explore those deeply embodied and shared connections to the coast which are important and should have greater prominence in coastal management policy and practice.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,What are heritage values? Integrating natural and cultural heritage into environmental valuation,"There are strong links between heritage and the environment yet, heritage is not fully included in existing ecosystem-based frameworks. Different understandings of heritage values exist, and heritage values are not yet related to key value categories in environmental values research. To address this gap and facilitate a common values-based approach, we develop a novel framework that links heritage and environmental values. First, we expand the understanding of heritage values by linking heritage to key environmental value categories. We then use the Life Framework of Values to show how heritage features in the different ways in which people relate to the world. The resulting heritage values framework is operationalised by applying it to six case examples drawn from participatory research on the governance of European coastal and maritime heritage. We found that the environment was not only considered to be a setting for heritage but was itself valued as heritage in different ways; that heritage is not extrinsic to the environment but is also a way in which people see meaning in the environment; and that multiple value frames and types were involved in shaping this perspective. The results highlight important discrepancies between stakeholders' perspectives and existing management approaches. Applying the framework shows the ways in which heritage and nature are entwined by providing a structure for elucidating what can be valued as heritage, what values can inform heritage values and how heritage values feature in human-nature relations.",culture; ecosystem services; heritage; Life Framework of Values; nature's contributions to people; participatory research; plural values,2023,5,"2, SI",10.1002/pan3.10386,NA,12,96,237,1563,7,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
PEOPLE AND NATURE,`I owe it to the animals': The bidirectionality of Swiss alpine farmers' relational values,"1. Relational values have recently been proposed as a concept to expand our un-derstanding of environmental values from the categories previously dominating the discourse: instrumental (nature for people's sake) and intrinsic values (nature for its own sake). Empirical and conceptual research on relational values has so far focused on the content of relational values or their relationship to other kinds of values. 2. In this paper, we fill a key gap in understanding exactly what relational values are and how they work; we call this the ``syntax' of relational values. We do so by applying the Syntax of Environmental Values Framework, which describes relational values as bidirectional, expressed by genuine respect and care on the one hand and an eudaimonic contribution to wellbeing on the other. 3. We developed a novel interview protocol which we applied in semistructured interviews with Swiss alpine farmers. We examine how both of these directions are manifested in farmers' relational values. 4. Our results showed how the bidirectionality manifests in relational values of alpine farmers. Specifically, we identified three components of each directional-ity. The intrinsic element of relational values was constituted by: an attitude of respect, attention to the relationship and practices of care. The instrumental element of relational values was constituted by: emotional and experiential con-tributions for the valuer, satisfaction and joy in the relationship, and practical contributions to the activities associated with the relationship (e.g. farm man-agement). We further elaborate on the conditions required to sustain relational values, including physical, emotional and sociopolitical conditions. 5. These results informed an elaborated conceptual framework of relational val-ues, and environmental valuing more generally. While specifically derived from our dataset, we believe our conclusions could directly or in a modified form, apply to diverse cases of relational valuing.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,A global analysis of factors predicting conservationists' values,"There exists a wealth of philosophical, sociological and anthropological literature on environmental values; yet, few studies have investigated the values held by conservationists themselves, and how these shape the conservation movement. Here, we present the first global analysis of the relationships between conservationists' values and a broad range of conservationists' characteristics, categorised into their educational and professional background, geographical context and personal experiences in childhood and adulthood. We draw on survey responses from 9264 conservationists from 149 countries to conduct the broadest analysis to date of what factors are associated with the values of conservationists. Our results demonstrate that 13 characteristics of conservationists' personal and professional backgrounds are statistically related to their values regarding the place of people, science, capitalism and nonhuman entities in conservation. Of these characteristics, educational specialism and continent of nationality had the highest predictive power. We also draw on open-text responses to uncover other factors that conservationists identify as having been important in shaping their values; travel and religion were the most commonly reported. Our findings have important implications for current debates on diversity and inclusion within the conservation community. In particular, we provide broad empirical evidence that increasing personal and professional diversity in conservation organisations is likely to also increase the range of values represented. We also discuss the implications of our results for interdisciplinarity, the management of disagreement and conflict in conservation, and the training of future generations of conservationists.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,Adaptive strategy biases in engineered ecosystems: Implications for plant community dynamics and the provisioning of ecosystem services to people,"1. Plant communities in green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) such as biofilters play an integral role in ecosystem services provisioning, such that many design manuals now feature plant lists that guide vegetation selection. 2. This study looks at the implications of those lists for biofilter plant communities and their services, focusing on (1) how plants are selected across US climate zones, (2) whether selected plants exhibit adaptive strategy biases (i.e. towards competitive, stress tolerant or ruderal strategies that might impact ecosystem services provisioning) and (3) whether human-induced selection or natural climatic processes underly any biases revealed. 3. Our results suggest that biofilter plant strategies are significantly biased towards stress tolerance or competitiveness (depending on the climate zone) and away from ruderalness relative to the broader pool of native and wetland-adapted native species. 4. Competitive bias was evident in humid-continental climates and stress-tolerant bias in hot coastal/arid climates, with some degree of anti-ruderal bias present across all zones. 5. These biases are correlated with human concerns related to water availability and climate (water conservation; p < 0.05, irrigation; p < 0.1, climate extremes; p < 0.1). They do not appear to reflect strict climatological limits (i.e. limits that are independent of preferences or design constraints imposed by people) because they are not also evident for native plants. 6.

Large carnivores, such as the African lion Panthera leo are often the focus of such conflicts as they have significant ecological and cultural value but impose severe social and financial costs on the communities that live alongside them. To effectively manage human-lion conflict, it is vital to understand stakeholder decision-making and preferences regarding mitigation techniques and coexistence strategies. We used a novel experimental game framed around lions and livestock protection, played across eight villages in Tanzania, to examine stakeholder behaviour in response to three incentive structures: support for non-lethal scaring, and individual- and community-level subsidies for provision of wildlife habitat. We found that non-lethal deterrent methods were the preferred mitigation strategy and that individual subsidies most increased the provision of wildlife habitat. Subsidies that were conditional on other community members' decisions were less effective at increasing habitat choices. Player characteristics and attitudes appeared to have little influence on game behaviour. However, there was some evidence that gender, wealth, perceptions of respect, and the behaviour of other players affected decision-making. Achieving success in managing conservation conflicts requires genuine stakeholder participation leading to mutually beneficial results. Our findings suggest that, while incentive-based instruments can promote pro-conservation behaviour, these may be more effective when targeted at individuals rather than groups. We demonstrate how experimental games offer a practical and engaging approach that can be used to explore preferences and encourage discussion of conflict management.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,Beyond the ecocentric: Diverse values and attitudes influence engagement in pro-environmental behaviours,"Changing human behaviour and social systems are key to reversing the global biodiversity crisis. Pro-environmental behaviour is guided by values and connection with nature, but because they have mostly been studied separately, the interplay between values and nature connection in influencing pro-environmental behaviour remains unclear. In particular, it is uncertain whether people who hold anthropocentric values have a less positive connection with nature than those who hold ecocentric values, and whether nature protection behaviours differ between people with different values or strengths of connection to nature. We used a stratified survey of 2100 respondents across Australia to measure orientation towards nature. We created segments based on individual values and connection with nature and characterised each segment based on demographics, nature-exposure, pro-environmental behaviours, support for environmental policies and political alignment. We discovered that a quarter of respondents had anthropocentric values alongside a strong connection with nature. Moreover, of those with a strong connection with nature, people with anthropocentric values more frequently undertook certain pro-environmental behaviours than those with ecocentric values. Our findings indicate that the strong expression of pro-environmental behaviour is not limited to people with ecocentric values. Rather, people with different values and strengths of connection to nature engage in different types of impactful nature protection behaviours, challenging stereotypes about those with anthropocentric values. These results further suggest that behavioural intervention strategies could be tailored to reach sectors of society with various combinations of values and strengths of connection to nature, thus maximising the expression of pro-environmental behaviour across the entire population.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,Climate change adaptation and adaptive efficacy in the inland fisheries of the Lake Victoria basin,"Inland fisheries support the livelihoods of millions of people in riparian communities worldwide but are influenced by increasing climate variability and change. Freshwater fishing societies are among the most vulnerable to climate change given their dependence on highly threatened aquatic resources. As climate change intensifies, building adaptive capacity within communities and understanding the efficacy of adaptive strategies for maintaining household stability is essential for coping with ongoing social and environmental change. In this study, we examined household perceptions of climate change, livelihood impacts and responses to socio-ecological changes in fishing-dependent households in the Lake Victoria basin in Uganda, East Africa. Through a series of household surveys and focus group discussions in five fish landing sites, we assessed social adaptive capacity (SAC) based on 207 households and identified adaptive strategies that are effective for coping with climatic change. We found that people in fishing households are aware of environmental change but that most households do not have adaptive strategies that are efficacious for securing long-term income and food security. We also investigated household demographics that contribute to SAC, examined links between SAC and adaptive efficacy and established potential routes towards developing effective adaptive approaches in small-scale fisheries. This work contributes to a growing foundation of documented community-based knowledge for building adaptive capacity in inland fisheries and the communities around the world that depend on them.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,Communicating nature during lockdown - How conservation and outdoor organisations use social media to facilitate local nature experiences,"Social media impact not only our communication and social interactions but also our relationships to the natural environment. Social media can increase understanding of our environment by offering information and sharing calls to action, while at the same time, they might present a glamourised, standardised picture of nature and distract from actual outdoor interactions. The COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique opportunity to study the spaces created for interactions between the online and offline natural world, especially in countries where movement and thus outdoor activities were restricted during lockdowns. To understand these interactions, we investigated the social media communication of nature conservation and outdoor organisations by analysing Twitter posts of four prominent NGOs in Scotland. We found that during the first COVID-19-induced UK lockdown in spring 2020, Scottish nature conservation and outdoor organisations made distinctive efforts in supporting followers to connect with nature in the face of restrictions. Organisations showed signs of moving towards community-building through sharing experiences often related to nearby nature, while calls for environmental action, more prominent in the previous year, receded in relative importance. Emphasis was put on sensory engagement with, and finding solace in the rhythm of, nature. References to taking action to protect nature now became linked to a green recovery from the pandemic. We conclude that NGOs used social media not as a space separate from the outdoors, but as an augmented space where online and offline interactions were interwoven and a space in which during the COVID-19 pandemic, new avenues for engagement were being explored.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,Conservation in conversation: People's perspectives on a woodland with high conservation value-A qualitative study,"Concepts such as ecosystem services and nature's contributions to people are frameworks for articulating the value of nature and biodiversity conservation. Yet it remains difficult to argue for the conservation of species and habitats where they are inconspicuous or `non-charismatic'. This paper investigates the perceptions of a woodland area in rural western Scotland, designated for its high conservation value and characterised by habitats, rare species and species assemblages with limited appreciation by non-experts and no obvious `utility' value. Based on interviews with residents and visitors as well as workshops with participants representing different types of local expertise, we show how people experience and perceive the benefits from such woodlands. Overall, our study participants emphasised values and ecosystem services that benefitted humans, strongly drawing on stories of cultural or historical land use to argue for more material opportunities to be created. For those participants without ecological expertise, the designated conservation value, albeit respected and accepted, remained vague and bland. Participants also articulated a strong underlying development logic, pushing in some way for `more' to be made from the woodlands so that more people could receive benefits from the woodland either directly (e.g. mental restoration; increased use for recreation) or indirectly (e.g. through creating jobs in the local tourism industry). Our findings suggest that managing for conservation alone might cause challenges in acceptability, especially where the species and habitats conserved are of little obvious value to the non-specialist. At the same time, participants recognised that they valued the woodland being unique in some way, and that increasing the material use of the woods might harm the very essence of what made it special.",biodiversity; ecosystem services; multiple benefits; rare species; Scotland; woodland management,2022,4,5,10.1002/pan3.10372,NA,14,114,271,1869,6,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
PEOPLE AND NATURE,Ecosystem restoration job creation potential in Brazil,"The central motivation to restore ecosystems at a planetary scale has been to reverse degradation and provide multiple environmental benefits, but key global players like governments may be more interested in social outcomes from undertaking restoration, such as job creation. Assessing the job opportunities stemming from ongoing restoration programmes can leverage additional investments for their implementation and support their long-term maintenance. Here, we aimed to understand and quantify current and potential ecosystem restoration jobs in Brazil, based on a widely distributed online survey performed in 2020 and led by the main restoration networks in the country. We explored the structure, job distribution and outputs of the national restoration supply chain. At the beginning of 2020, 4713 temporary and 3510 permanent jobs were created, nearly 60\% of which were generated by organizations specialized in restoration, mainly from the non-profit (48\%) and private (37\%) sectors. Restoration jobs were concentrated in organizations working in one (58\%) or two (28\%) biomes, and the vast majority were in the Atlantic Forest (85\%). Similarly, most restoration jobs were concentrated in the southeast region (61\%), with one-third in the state of Sao Paulo. This geographical distribution was more strongly associated with the states' GDP than with the legal deficit of native vegetation area. Nearly 20\% of the restoration jobs were terminated during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We estimate that restoration activities can generate 0.42 jobs per hectare undergoing restoration, which could potentially create 1.0-2.5 million direct jobs through the implementation of Brazil's target of restoring 12 million hectares. We conclude by reinforcing the value of ecosystem restoration in promoting economic development and job creation, which can be crucial to promote countries' effective engagement in the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. We also highlight the critical role of grassroots organizations to maximize restoration opportunities for socioeconomic development during the post-pandemic economic recovery.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,Image-based analyses from an online repository provide rich information on long-term changes in morphology and human perceptions of rhinos,"Online image repositories can offer a freely accessible, information-rich and cost-effective alternative to museum collections for studying long-term changes in human interactions with nature and ecological and evolutionary change. The Rhino Resource Center (RRC) is one example, curated by experts and holding a collection of >4000 rhino images, including both artistic portrayals (1481-2021) and photographs (taken between 1862-2021), and representing a potentially valuable case study to investigate the utility of online image repositories for research into large vertebrates and, potentially, other well-recorded smaller taxa. The five extant species of rhino are all threatened by habitat loss and human hunting and therefore are an important focus for conservation research. We used the RRC for two separate research approaches: (i) assessing the changing representations and human interactions with rhinos using 3158 images (1531 pieces of artwork and 1627 photographs); and (ii) determining to what extent morphological data can be extracted from photographs to assess changes in horn length over time, using a sample size of 80 photographs of rhinos taken in profile view. We found that African rhino species have become more commonly depicted in images, compared to Asian rhino species over time. During the age of European imperialism (between the 16th and 20th centuries), rhinos were commonly portrayed as hunting trophies, but since the mid-20th century, they have been increasingly portrayed in a conservation context, reflecting a change in emphasis from a more to less consumptive relationship between humans and rhinos. Finally, we found evidence for declining horn length over time across species, perhaps related to selective pressure of hunting, and indicating a utility for image-based approaches in understanding societal perceptions of large vertebrates and trait evolution.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,Improving governance outcomes for water quality: Insights from participatory social network analysis for chalk stream catchments in England,"Globally important chalk streams in England are in poor ecological health, in part due to inadequate water quality. Addressing this issue requires an understanding of the governance systems that surround water quality. The complexity and uncertainty inherent in hydrological systems has led to the emergence of integrated and adaptive forms of governance. In these multi-actor governance systems, the structure of the relationships between actors (the social network) has been shown to affect governance processes and outcomes. Using participatory social network analysis, we mapped and analysed the social networks for the River Test and River Itchen in Hampshire, United Kingdom, to identify actors and their roles, determine the network characteristics and identify interventions to improve governance. Although the results suggest a well-connected network of actors from the state, private sector and civil society, we find that decision-making is not decentralised. Bureaucratic governance by central state actors dominates. However, trust in these central state actors and private actors in the networks is low, which undermines collaboration and co-ordination in the network. Devolving authority to local actors, building trust in the networks and improving connections to important actors could help to improve governance outcomes for water quality.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,Integrating Indigenous and scientific perspectives on environmental changes: Insights from boreal landscapes,"Major environmental changes affect the health and capacity of ecosystems to sustain Indigenous people's well-being in boreal landscapes. Collaboration between Indigenous communities and researchers could help assessing and mitigating the consequences of environmental changes. We used Driver Pressure State Impact (DPSI) conceptual models to compare the perspectives of Indigenous and scientific communities on environmental changes in boreal landscapes of Quebec, Canada. The Indigenous DPSI model emerged from interviews with local land-use experts from two Indigenous communities. The scientific model was informed by the publication topics of expert researchers. We compared the Indigenous and scientific models and exposed convergences and divergences between perspectives. Forestry was identified as a major driver of change in both models. Most issues related to mining, hydro-power and forest road development were specific to the Indigenous model. Climate change and wildfires were of greater interest in the scientific model. Convergences between the perspectives of Indigenous and scientific communities are conducive to collaborative research. Divergences could be addressed through reciprocal knowledge transfer activities, which would lead to research that better aligns with the concerns and needs of Indigenous communities.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,"Interpreting the mammal deposits of Cloggs Cave (SE Australia), GunaiKurnai Aboriginal Country, through community-led partnership research","Palaeontological animal bone deposits are rarely investigated through research partnerships where the local First Nations communities have a defining hand in both the research questions asked and the research processes. Here we report research undertaken through such a partnership approach at the iconic archaeological site of Cloggs Cave (GunaiKurnai Country, East Gippsland), in the southern foothills of SE Australia's Great Dividing Range. A new excavation was combined with detailed chronometric dating, high-resolution 3D mapping and geomorphological studies. This allowed interpretation of a sequence of stratigraphic layers spanning from a lowermost excavated mixed layer dated to between 25,640 and 48,470 cal BP, to a dense set of uppermost, ash layers dated to between 1460 and 3360 cal BP. This long and well-dated chronostratigraphic sequence enabled temporal trends in the abundant small mammal remains to be examined. The fossil assemblage consists of at least 31 taxa of mammals which change in proportions through time. Despite clear evidence that the Old Ancestors repeatedly carried vegetation into the cave to fuel cool fires (no visible vegetation grows in Cloggs Cave), we observed little to no evidence of cooking fires or calcined bone, suggesting that people had little involvement with the accumulation of the faunal remains. Small mammal bones were most likely deposited in the cave by large disc-faced owls, Tyto novaehollandae (Masked Owl) or Tyto tenebricosa (Sooty Owl). Despite being well dated and largely undisturbed, the Cloggs Cave assemblage does not appear to track known Late Quaternary environmental change. Instead, the complex geomorphology of the area fostered a vegetation mosaic that supported mammals with divergent habitat preferences. The faunal deposit suggests a local ancestral landscape characterised by a resilient mosaic of habitats that persisted over thousands of years, signalling that the Old Ancestors burned landscape fires to encourage and manage patches of different vegetation types and ages within and through periods of climate change.

PEOPLE AND NATURE,Knowledge of returning wildlife species and willingness to participate in citizen science projects among wildlife park visitors in Germany,"Successful conservation efforts have led to recent increases of large mammals such as European bison Bison bonasus, moose Alces alces and grey wolf Canis lupus and their return to former habitats in central Europe. While embraced by some, the recovery of these species is a controversial topic and holds potential for human-wildlife conflicts. Involving the public has been suggested to be an effective method for monitoring wildlife and mitigating associated conflicts. To assess two interrelated prerequisites for engaging people in Citizen Science (CS)-knowledge of returning species and respondents' readiness to participate in CS activities for monitoring and managing these species-we conducted a survey (questionnaire) in two wildlife parks located in different states of Germany. Based on 472 complete questionnaires, we developed generalized linear models to understand how sociodemographic variables and exposure to the species affected visitors' knowledge of each species, and to investigate if sociodemographic variables and knowledge influenced the likelihood of visitors to participate in CS activities. Almost all visitors were aware of the returning wolf population, while knowledge and awareness about bison and moose were significantly lower. Knowledge of the two herbivores differed geographically (higher knowledge of moose in the north-eastern state), possibly indicating a positive association between exposure to the species and knowledge. However, models generally performed poorly in predicting knowledge about wildlife, suggesting that such specific knowledge is insufficiently explained by sociodemographic variables. Our model, which explained stated willingness in CS indicated that younger participants and those with higher knowledge scores in the survey were more willing to engage in CS activities. Overall, our analyses highlight how exposure to large mammals, knowledge about wildlife and human demographics are interrelated-insights that are helpful for effectively recruiting citizen scientists for wildlife conservation.

PHYTOCOENOLOGIA,Aligning terrestrial habitat typology of Lebanon with EUNIS habitat classification,"The absence of nationally accepted typology to classify and describe habitats has been an obstacle to the development of coordinated research in this field and to the implementation of conservation actions; therefore, a classification of the natural and semi-natural terrestrial habitat types existing in Lebanon is presented and adapted to the hierarchical structure of the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitat classification. The harmonisation with an international classification system is essential to facilitate communication and research throughout the Mediterranean Basin. A total of 1597 sites surveyed throughout Lebanon between 2013 and 2020 were classified and described based on the analysis of the physiognomic parameters and specific composition of their vegetation. The analysis yielded 190 habitat types for Lebanon, including 12 coastal habitats (category N), 35 related to inland surface waters (C), 6 wetland habitats (Q), 20 grasslands (R), 54 scrublands and heaths habitats (S), 27 types of woodlands (T), 17 inland unvegetated habitats (U), and 19 vegetated man-made habitats (V). Sixty-one habitats characteristic of Lebanon, not previously included in the EUNIS classification, were described and proposed in this typology.

Pure and impure seed samples were taken from the cold room which is adjusted to 5 ??C. Then they were sown on prepared media under different conditions. Then the GP, MGT, and PV data were computed and then subjected to ANOVA. The ANOVA showed that the interaction effect of genotype, GME treatments, and SCS was very high (P ??? 0.0001) significant for all studied parameters. The germination pattern differences were also observed in SCS and GME treatments for both species. Signifi-cantly higher GP (59\%) and PV (8.4) were recorded in pure seeds sowed on paper at ambient temperature (T1) for O. abyssinica. On the same GME, Y. alpina gave the maximum GP (38\%) and PV (2.3) using pure seed. However, significantly higher MGT (9) was recorded on GME T1 and T2 using impure seed. Hence, pure seed sowed on paper at ambient temperature is advisable for in vitro germination test.

PHYTOCOENOLOGIA,Syntaxonomy and ecology of mesophilous scrub vegetation in Tajikistan (Middle Asia),"Aims: In this paper we propose the first syntaxonomic classification for the mesophilous scrub vegetation in Tajikistan with some remarks on their environmental variability. Methods: Altogether 120 relev??s were sam-pled using the standard, seven-degree cover-abundance scale of Braun-Blanquet, in 2015???2021. They were clas-sified by the modified TWINSPAN method using the four step interval scale with cutoff levels of 0\%, 2\%, 5\% and 10\% and total inertia as a measure of cluster heterogeneity. Diagnostic species were identified using the phi coefficient as a fidelity measure. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was used to determine the rela-tionship between the sampled plots, vegetation units and major gradients in species composition. Results: Plant communities known so far as ??hiblyak and including xeric and mesophilic shrublands seral or marginal to broad-leaved forests in the nemoral zone of the Irano-Turanian region are described herein. Numerical analyses of vegetation data allowed distinguishing five associations representing the Ranunculo tenuilobi-Cotoneasteri-on hissarici alliance. The new associations include: Eremuro comosi-Rhuidetum coriariae, Calophacetum gran-diflorae, Fraxinetum raibocarpae, Pruno sogdianae-Crataegetum turkestanicae, Aflatunio ulmifoliae-Caraga-netum turkestanicae. For the latter association, two habitat variants (with Ferula clematidifolia and Malus sieversii) are proposed. The main factors determining the species composition of the studied vegetation include: elevation, mean annual temperature and sum of annual precipitation.

PHYTOCOENOLOGIA,New insights on plant communities and flora of the southern paramos of the Iberian Range (Spain),"Aims: In the Iberian Peninsula, high and flat areas called `paramos' are of great ecological interest, due to their unique but little known plant and animal communities. In this work, we contribute to the knowledge of plant composition and carry out a classification of plant communities in central Iberian natural `paramos'. Study area: Two Special Areas of Conservation (Natura 2000 Network) in Southern Soria (Spain): `Altos de Barahona' and `Paramo de Layna'. Methods: We sampled the vegetation (plant cover) in 345 plots of 1 m2 in the two `paramos' considered. A hierarchical agglomerative clustering of samples and an indicator value (IndVal) analysis were performed to classify the plant communities and to determine the most characteristic species of each community. Results: A total of 193 species, mainly chamaephytes, were found. Most of these are species of Mediterranean biogeographical affinity, with a high percentage of Iberian endemism. Plots were hierarchically classified into three main clusters, which in turn, successfully aggregated into seven subclusters reflecting characteristic visually-known plant communities of these `paramos': grassland-thyme scrublands of Thymus mastigophorus; savory scrublands of Satureja intricata; two types of mixed communities dominated by continental basophilic shrubs; gorse shrublands of Genista pumila subsp. rigidissima; praire-thyme scrublands of Thymus zygis subsp. zygis; and sage scrublands of Salvia lavandulifolia subsp. lavandulifolia.

PHYTOCOENOLOGIA,Six new variants of the Terminalia cloud forest in the Dhofar Mountains of Oman,"Background and Aims: The Terminalia cloud forest is endemic to a 200 km stretch of coastal mountains in southern Arabia. This research aims to describe patterns of variation in the species composition of the Terminalia forest in Dhofar, Oman and examine causal environmental factors. Study area: The Jabal Qamar mountain range, Dhofar, Oman. Methods: Hierarchical cluster analysis and indicator species analysis were used to identify and describe variants of the Terminalia forest. Topoclimatic factors, vegetation characteristics and disturbance factors were compared between the variants using ordination and ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Six new variants of the Terminalia forest are described. These are the Dodonaea viscosa subsp. angustifolia shrubland variant, Cadia purpurea-Olea europaea forest variant, Euclea racemosa-Jasminum grandiflorum shrubland variant, Gymnosporia dhofarensis-Ficus sycomorus woodland variant, Jatropha dhofarica-Zygocarpum dhofarense sparse woodland variant and the Premna resinosa-Hybanthus durus forest variant. A seventh variant was identified, which was previously described by Kurschner et al. (2004); the broad-leaved Blepharispermum hirtum shrubland. The species composition and environmental conditions indicate that two variants are the result of anthropogenic disturbance, whilst the other variants are well separated along fog density and topographic position gradients. Conclusions: Distinct variants of the Terminalia forest in Jabal Qamar result from spatial variability in environmental conditions associated with the complex topography, monsoon fog distributions, and anthropogenic disturbance.

PHYTOCOENOLOGIA,The long-term effects of monoculture maize cultivation on plant diversity,"Biodiversity loss is one of the most serious global environmental problems caused by human activities. The intensification of agriculture and the increasing presence of monocultures is one of the main reasons for this. To study the long-term effects of maize monocultures compared to crop rotation systems on vegetation and biodiversity, two nearby sites in the small village of Metschach in Central Carinthia, Austria, were monitored for 30 years. These two test sites with intensively used arable land, divided into maize and crop rotation (14.5 ha in total) were taken out of production in 1989 as part of a nature conservation project. Changes in the composition and abundance of vascular plant species were recorded in 29 permanent plots. The monitoring showed that the previous use has long-lasting effects on species richness and ecological indicator values of the fallow land: The species numbers of the former maize field remained on average 10 species below those of the former crop rotation field over the entire study period. After 30 years, the plant communities in the former crop rotation revealed tendencies towards species-rich grassland communities, whereas in the former maize monoculture Elymus repens or tall herbaceous fringe communities remained dominant.

PHYTOCOENOLOGIA,The vegetation of cushion peatlands in the Argentine Andes and changes in their floristic composition across a latitudinal gradient from 39 degrees S to 22 degrees S,"The vegetation of the high-Andean cushion-plant peatlands is mainly characterized by the cushion-forming Juncaceae of the genus Oxychloe, Distichia and Patosia, as well as Cyperaceae of the genus Zameioscirpus. This particularity of Southern Hemisphere cushion peatlands is unique and exclusive to the high-Andean regions of South America. The floristic composition and site factors of 340 peatlands were studied between 1995-2013 to investigate changes in the vegetation of the high Andean peatlands from its southernmost distribution in Argentina (39 degrees S, province of Neuquen) to the limit with Bolivia (22 degrees S, province of Jujuy). Site factors were characterized based on water samples. Data for precipitation and temperature conditions was obtained from the WorldClim 2.0 dataset. Cushion-plant species and their accompanying flora clearly reflect the changing ecological conditions along the marked climatic gradient from south to north. A group of species is limited to the southern region of the study area (provinces of Neuquen and Mendoza), and another group is limited almost exclusively to the northern region (provinces of San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Salta and Jujuy). Some Oxychloe species are distributed only in the transition zone between the winter and predominantly summer rainfall zone, however, many accompanying species show wide ecological amplitudes. The quality in the supply of minerals does not seem to play a decisive role in the differentiation of vegetation, except for the concentration of salts. Climatic conditions seem to be more relevant to the presence of the species. Our research shows that the survival of the plants is closely linked to the rainfall regime and seasonal temperature fluctuations. Similarly, the survival of plants and the potential formation of flowers and mature seeds depends on the presence of pollinators and species that disperse seeds (e.g. birds and camelids). Mobility by dispersion is also necessary for plant survival in the high Andean regions, which have experienced repeated climatic changes over the past centuries and millennia. This brought about the permanent displacement of the zoning of vegetation, and with it, the displacement of zones favorable for cushion-plant growth. The phylogenetic relationships and the spatial distribution suggest that the cushion-forming Juncaceae, depending on the evolution of climate, geomorphological processes and local site conditions, progressed step by step from the south to the north. Their current distribution is therefore largely understood as a result of short-term and long-term climatic changes.",bofedales; cushion plants; high-Andean vegetation; Oxychloe; Patosia; Distichia; Zameioscirpus; peatlands,2020,50,3,10.1127/phyto/2020/0374,0340-269X,27,165,388,2630,8,NA,300,12,Yes,325,275,yes,no,yes
PHYTOCOENOLOGIA,Therophytic halophilous vegetation classification in South-Eastern Italy,"Aims: Halophilous, sub-halophilous, and halo-nitrophilous annual plant communities belonging to the Thero-Salicornietea and Saginetea maritimae classes have been analyzed in South-Eastern Italy. Even if numerous contributions have been provided on these vegetation types, at diverse scales of observation, the different and sometimes contrasting syntaxonomic treatments adopted by different authors, as well as the phytogeographical interpretations, have led to uncertainty about their proper classification and nomenclature. Methods: In the present contribution a data-set of 391 releves (230 from literature and 161 original data) was first subjected to some basic statistics and then analyzed through flexible beta clustering. CH index was used to determine the best partition, and the phi coefficient for the identification of diagnostic species. Indirect gradient analysis was performed by DCA ordination. Results: Results were interpreted from a syntaxonomic point of view. As regards Thero-Salicornietea, halophilous communities are well separated from the halo-nitrophilous ones in the two orders Thero-Salicornietalia and Thero-Suaedetalia splendentis. Within Thero-Salicornietalia, a new alliance, Salicornion venetae, including the tetraploid Salicornia vegetation typically growing in long flooded sites of the Adriatic region, is here proposed. As for Saginetea maritimae, two main groups well separate: rocky coasts, sandy soils (Saginetalia maritimae, with the E-Mediterranean alliance Sileno sedoidis-Catapodion balearici) and salt marshes, clayey-silty soils (Frankenietalia pulverulentae, here with the two alliances Frankenion pulverulentae and Limonion avei).",halophilous vegetation; Thero-Salicornietea; Saginetea maritimae; vegetation classification; syntaxonomy; coastal vegetation; South-Eastern Italy; Mediterranean area,2020,50,2,10.1127/phyto/2020/0364,0340-269X,7,72,217,1679,8,NA,300,12,Yes,325,275,no,yes,yes
PLANT ECOLOGY,Different adaptive strategies of three mangrove species to nutrient enrichment,"Mangrove species are undergoing environmental changes from nutrient-poor to enrichment due to the large nutrient input. The potential difference in adaptive strategies between the slow- and fast-growing species may lead to great changes in species interaction and ecosystem stability. This study aims to test whether the slow-growing species Aegiceras corniculatum (L.) Blanco and Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu \& Yong sp. nov. are distinctly different from a fast-growing species Laguncularia racemosa (L.) Gaertn. f. in response to soil nutrient enrichment. With the increase of soil nutrients, L. racemosa shifted from a more conservative to a more acquisitive strategy. The potential causes included the increases in specific leaf area, nutrient resorption efficiency, and photosynthetic capacity as indicated by the increase of leaf delta C-13 and unchanged leaf succulence, as well as the relocation of photosynthetic products as indicated by the shift toward fast-growing at the cost of constructive and defense compounds. In contrast, A. corniculatum and K. obovata maintained conservative strategies at any soil nutrient levels with only a slight increase in growth. These findings implied that L. racemosa will be more competitive over the slow-growing species in nutrient-rich soils through altering adaptive strategies.",Aegiceras corniculatum; Acquisitive strategy; Conservative strategy; Fast-growing; Growth-defense trade-off; Kandelia obovata; Laguncularia racemosa; Slow-growing,2022,223,9,10.1007/s11258-022-01260-7,1385-0237,10,78,192,1329,8,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
PLANT ECOLOGY,"Climate change alters future distribution of mountain plants, a case study of Astragalus adscendens in Iran","Climate is one of the most important elements affecting the distribution of species, and it is expected that the distribution of species will be widely influenced by climate change. In plants, edaphic factors also play a special role along with climate in determining the distribution range. The current study aimed to predict the future distribution of the Persian manna (Astragalus adscendens), an endemic perennial shrub in Zagros Mountains of Western Iran. For this purpose, two sets of static (i.e. edaphic and physiographic) and dynamic (i.e. climatic) data and an ensemble approach were used to develop two edaphic-physiographic and climatic models. Current and future suitability maps are representative of the climatic and the edaphic-physiographic niches of A. Adscendens that were obtained based on climatic suitable areas filtered by edaphic-physiographic model. The filtered map has less suitable habitats compared to the climatic model. Three dynamic variables (mean temperature of wettest quarter, temperature seasonality, temperature annual range) and two static variables (altitude and volumetric fraction of coarse fragments) were identified as the most important factors in determining the habitat of A. Adscendens. The importance of altitude was greater than latitude in maintaining or losing suitable habitats under different climate change scenarios, suggesting that the species will not have range expansion or northward shift due to no significant shift in latitude and longitude. Results revealed a sharp decline in the suitable habitats in such that 67\% and 91\% of the current habitat may be lost by the year 2050 and 2070, respectively. Area reduction was more extreme in future scenarios with the higher level of CO2 emission. Range contraction of A. Adscendens will increases the risk of extinction. This study provides insights into the response of mountain plants, especially range restricted species, to climate change, revealing major dimensions of plant niche. Therefore, developing habitat management and conservation plans to preserve the predicted habitats of such species are required to preserve the predicted sustainable habitats.",Habitat suitability; Species distribution models; Climate change scenarios; General circulation models; Extinction risk,2022,223,10-Dec,10.1007/s11258-022-01273-2,1385-0237,16,107,320,2172,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
PLANT ECOLOGY,Are liana communities in linear canopy openings subject to edge effects?,"Studies have revealed a significant increase in liana abundance due to intense fragmentation and consequent edge effects in tropical forests. This study evaluated whether liana communities adjacent to linear canopy openings experience edge effects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For vegetation sampling, 12 sampling units (20 x 50 m) were distributed among forest fragments with four sampling units in each of three treatments: old-growth forest, power line edge (40 years old and 100 m wide), and gas pipeline edge (20 years old and 25 m wide). All lianas with Diameter at Ground Height (DGH) >= 2.5 cm were measured. Subplots (20 x 20 m) were also allocated to measure individuals with DGH between 0.5 and 2.49 cm. Edge effects were determined using the parameters: abundance, basal area, species richness, and species composition. Edge and interior lianas were similar for all measured parameters for both diameters classes. There was a higher rate of infestation by lianas in larger trees both on the edges and interior. These linear openings resulted in only few alterations to liana community dynamics along edges, indicating that fragmentation from linear openings may result in a softer edge effect or that edge effects may even attenuate over time due to linear openings. Finally, liana infestation on larger trees suggests that tree structure plays an important role in structural patterns of liana communities.",Fragmentation; Woody vines; Linear edges; Liana infestation; Atlantic Forest,2022,223,8,10.1007/s11258-022-01253-6,1385-0237,11,72,224,1424,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
PLANT ECOLOGY,Phenotypic variation along urban-to-rural gradients: an attempt to disentangle the mechanisms at play using the alien species Matricaria discoidea (Asteraceae),"Cities often exhibit higher temperatures, drier soils and greater habitat fragmentation than rural areas, and may thus represent constraining growing environments for plants. This variety of environmental conditions along urban-to-rural gradients might lead to plasticity in plant traits. Urban conditions could affect plant traits such as germination or flower number - key variables for organismal fitness. These proxies of fitness could then potentially experience strong selection in urban environments. Trait variations among individuals are not only due to genotype or the environmental conditions: they can also result from the conditions in which the mother individual developed, i.e. environmental maternal effects. Understanding the impact of city environments on phenotypes might be especially important for alien plant species, as these are often showing exceptionally high density and diversity in cities. However, studies of the sources of alien plant trait variations in urban environments are rare. We conducted a simulated reciprocal common garden experiment using seeds of populations of M. discoidea along urbanization gradients in Belgium. These seeds were sown in growth chambers to study how germination, growth, and flowering traits of the alien species Matricaria discoidea vary in response to temperature (rural or urban) and soil (rural or urban) treatments and the urbanity (percentage of impervious surfaces) of its source population. We found predominant effects of seed mass and germination delay which materialized important environmental maternal effects. We observed a higher germination success and delay for heavier seeds, and a greater number of capitula and dry biomass for plants that germinated earlier. Climate and soil treatments led to plasticity in the majority of the measured traits, with a faster germination and heavier plants in the urban temperature treatment but lighter plants in the urban soil treatment. Our results therefore support the existence of predominant environmental maternal effects and phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature and soil treatments, but no visible evidence of local adaptation.",Urbanization; Alien plants; Environmental maternal effects; Simulated reciprocal garden; Local adaptation,2022,223,10-Dec,10.1007/s11258-022-01269-y,1385-0237,20,159,312,2165,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
PLANT ECOLOGY,Fire regime and climate determine spatial variation in level of serotiny and population structure in a fire-killed conifer,"Fire-killed serotinous trees are often dominant species in fire-prone regions with contrasting wet and dry seasons. We studied a serotinous fire-killed conifer (Callitris preissii, Cupressaceae) to identify the influence of fire regime and climate on geographic variation in level of serotiny, recruitment and population structure. We measured population size distributions, seedling recruitment and level of serotiny for sample stands across a climatic gradient from mesic coastal (including two islands) to semi-arid inland sites in SW Australia. Trees on islands were mostly non-serotinous and were only weakly serotinous on the adjacent mainland in the higher rainfall West coast region. In the semi-arid Goldfields and South inland, and the higher rainfall South coast region, trees were more strongly serotinous with up to six cohorts of closed cones retained on trees. Level of serotiny was stronger at the drier end of the climatic gradient where severe to extreme fire danger weather occurs most frequently, and where vegetation type (e.g., shrublands) supports frequent crown-type, stand-replacing fires. Recruitment was most abundant post-fire in all regions, but seedlings also established inter-fire where there was regular seed fall due to low level of serotiny or spontaneous release of seeds from old cones on trees with a high cone load. Population structures for mainland stands shifted from approximately reverse-J (indicating continuous recruitment) in mesic regions to mainly unimodal (establishment mostly after fire) in drier, inland regions, although some long-unburned inland stands showed occasional inter-fire recruitment, likely linked to high rainfall years. Unimodal population structures characterized islands, where previous studies have identified herbivory on seedlings by refugial populations of native macropods as a limiting factor on inter-fire establishment. Understanding landscape context, response to disturbance, biotic interactions and reproductive traits of dominant species is essential in conservation planning in a rapidly changing global environment.",Callitris; Cypress pine; Population structure; Reseeder; Serotiny; SW Australia,2022,223,"7, SI",10.1007/s11258-022-01243-8,1385-0237,18,122,294,2099,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
PLANT ECOLOGY,The scaling of leaf nitrogen and phosphorus along a phosphorus availability gradient in a subtropical forest,"Allometric scaling of leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) provides information on species adaptation to resource availability and nutrient limitation of primary production. Studies examining how plant functional traits vary spatially have historically used global datasets, which may blur variation at local scale and thus some of the key drivers. Global studies have observed leaf N-P scaling exponents varied across different functional groups, latitudinal zones, ecoregions, and sites. However, whether these trends are consistent in a local habitat is still unclear. Here, we capitalized on a soil P availability gradient in subtropical China to examine scaling exponents of leaf N-P. We investigated 21 woody species at P-rich and P-poor sites for two consecutive years and estimated scaling exponents of leaf N-P across P-type sites, leaf ages, plant functional types, and phylogeny. The exponents varied across the abovementioned levels from 0.356 to 0.699. Averaged across all plant species, the exponent of 0.612 was a departure from the global average of (2)/(3) (0.66) and (3)/(4) (0.75). Two types of P-sites did not affect N-P exponents of deciduous-broadleaved trees and evergreen conifers. Our findings indicated that leaf N-P scaling exponents significantly differed within plant functional types and highlighted the resource availability in shaping nutrient cycling and evolutionary processes at local scales.",Allometry; Nitrogen; Phosphorus-rich soils; Plant functional type; Subtropics,2022,223,8,10.1007/s11258-022-01252-7,1385-0237,16,108,208,1427,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
PLANT ECOLOGY,"Declining pollination success reinforces negative climate and fire change impacts in a serotinous, fire-killed plant","Climate change projections predict that Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs) are becoming hotter and drier and that fires will become more frequent and severe. While most plant species in these important biodiversity hotspots are adapted to hot, dry summers and recurrent fire, the Interval Squeeze framework suggests that reduced seed production (demographic shift), reduced seedling establishment after fire (post fire recruitment shift), and reduction in the time between successive fires (fire interval shift) will threaten fire killed species under climate change. One additional potential driver of accelerated species decline, however, has not been considered so far: the decrease in pollination success observed in many ecosystems worldwide has the potential to further reduce seed accumulation and thus population persistence also in these already threatened systems. Using the well-studied fire-killed and serotinous shrub species Banksia hookeriana as an example, we apply a new spatially implicit population simulation model to explore population dynamics under past (1988-2002) and current (2003-2017) climate conditions, deterministic and stochastic fire regimes, and alternative scenarios of pollination decline. Overall, model results suggest that while B. hookeriana populations were stable under past climate conditions, they will not continue to persist under current (and prospective future) climate. Negative effects of climatic changes and more frequent fires are reinforced by the measured decline in seed set leading to further reduction in the mean persistence time by 12-17\%. These findings clearly indicate that declining pollination rates can be a critical factor that increases further the pressure on the persistence of fire-killed plants. Future research needs to investigate whether other fire-killed species are similarly threatened, and if local population extinction may be compensated by recolonization events, facilitating persistence in spatially structured meta-communities.",Climate change; Fire frequency; Interval squeeze; Pollination; Process-based simulation model; Mediterranean-type ecosystem,2022,223,"7, SI",10.1007/s11258-022-01244-7,1385-0237,15,116,276,2014,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
PLANT ECOLOGY,Fire effects on diversity patterns of the understory communities of Araucaria-Nothofagus forests,"Short-interval and high-severity fires combined are emerging as a catalyst of major reorganization of understory plant communities. In temperate forests of south-central Chile, concern exists about the resilience of threatened Araucaria-Nothofagus forests, including its understory community following extensive and severe fires. In this study we use an array of diversity indices and functional traits as proxies of community resilience. We ask if the species and communities are affected by wildfires, and how these responses are mediated by burn severity and frequency, and other biophysical variables. First, we explore the hypothesis that fire is the major driver of community changes, and that burn severity is the main factor that shifts compositional attributes of communities. Secondly, we hypothesize that a reburn will lead to a greater shift than a single burn in understory compositional attributes, where resprouting species replace obligate seeders, reducing local diversity. We established 120 field plots across a burn severity gradient in two study sites: one affected by a single (burned 2015), and the second by two fires (burned 2002 and 2015), where vascular plant species abundance, among other biotic, abiotic, and topographic variables were estimated. We found that burn (high) severity is the main driver of post-fire understory assemblages, resulting in communities less competitive and heterogeneous, with an increasing number of exotic species. Also, post-fire responses are resulting in communities in which the high abundance of flammable taxa and post-fire resprouter species at the early-seral stage may lead to large-scale transitions from mesic forest ecosystems to dry, open forest and fire-prone shrublands in reburned areas. Our results highlight the ecological importance of short-interval and severe wildfires as leading factors in the transition of post-fire understory communities of Araucaria-Nothofagus forests to a system dominated by post-fire obligate resprouters, where tree species are less represented compromising the recovery of these ecosystems. These findings improve the understanding of the current post-fire processes that affect flammability feedbacks and contribute to a baseline of the current patterns in a world of altered fire regimes.",Understory composition; Araucaria-Nothofagus forests; Species diversity; Post-fire traits; Generalized linear models,2022,223,"7, SI",10.1007/s11258-022-01247-4,1385-0237,12,96,331,2298,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY,First record of potential bird pollination in the holoparasitic genus Orobanche L.,"Pollinators play an important role in the reproduction of zoophilous plants. A shift in pollinators has often been observed for oceanic island plants, probably because of the differences in fauna. In this study, we obtained data on pollinator shifts from insects to birds in Orobanche boninsimae (Orobanchaceae), a holoparasitic plant species endemic to the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands, oceanic islands in the Pacific. We observed pollination and measured seed viability in O. boninsimae and its continental sister species O. coerulescens. We found that two passerine birds, the Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus) and bulbul (Hypsipetes amaurotis squameiceps), visited the flowers and sucked the nectar of O. boninsimae, while only insects visited those of O. coerulescens. Viable seeds were produced under pollinator-excluded treatments in the two Orobanche species, indicating that the seeds were produced by automatic self-pollination and/or apomixis. These results suggest that O. boninsimae may be pollinated by birds and can produce seeds by automatic self-pollination/apomixis. This is the first record of visitation of the genus Orobanche by birds. Studies of pollination systems in native plants on the Bonin Islands are few compared to those on other oceanic islands, and O. boninsimae may provide a valuable example of pollinator shifts in the Bonin Islands.",Bonin Islands; endemic species; oceanic island; parasitic plant; pollination,2023,38,1,10.1111/1442-1984.12389,0913-557X,12,82,202,1373,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY,Dormancy and viability of Ferocactus peninsulae (Cactaceae) seeds,"Knowledge on seed dormancy is crucial for the understanding of plant population dynamics, as it controls seed germination and seed bank formation. Dormant seeds have high potential to establish in soil seed banks, but such information within Cactaceae is scarce, although it is essential for conservation programs. The aim of this study was to determine if seeds of Ferocactus peninsulae showed any kind of dormancy and to test their germination capacity after storage. This was assessed with 15 seed sowing experiments done over 4 years with seeds stored under room conditions (20 +/- 2 degrees C). We demonstrated the existence of physiological dormancy in F. peninsulae seeds that is broken with an after-ripening period. Germination was low during the first 3 months of storage (d = 0.206) but increased after 10 months of storage (d = 0.654), and seeds maintained their viability at 48 months (d = 0.707). Also, their speed of germination increased with storage time. Ferocactus peninsulae seeds are positively photoblastic, and the requirement for light for germination persisted over all experiments. The results provide crucial information for propagation and conservation research and may allow us to infer that F. peninsulae seeds are able to form a persistent soil seed bank, as they maintained their viability after dormancy is released.",after-ripening; Cacteae; germination; seed bank; Sonoran Desert,2022,37,2,10.1111/1442-1984.12365,0913-557X,8,65,212,1349,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY,First report of Avicennia germinans (Acanthaceae) as a larval host of Junonia litoralis (Nymphalidae) causing higher foliar damage in seedlings than trees,"Herbivory is considered an important biotic interaction in mangroves. Nevertheless, detailed information on specific plant-herbivore interactions that might have considerable influence in ecological and evolutionary processes is still very poor and fragmented. Herbivory damage was quantified during December 2015 in seedlings and trees in monospecific stands of Avicennia germinans in Laguna Madre of Tamaulipas, Mexico. The use of this mangrove species as a larval host is well documented; however, this is the first report for Junonia litoralis. These lepidopteran larvae consumed, on average, 10.2\% of the leaf area; but herbivory was higher on seedlings (mean 15\%) than on trees (mean 2.3\%). These values are comparable to estimations of 10\% mean herbivory damage in other field studies. This indicates that herbivores cause greater damage in seedlings than in trees. Herbivore activity by J. litoralis only occurred in A. germinans and did not affect associated herbs or shrubs of other species. The close interaction between J. litoralis and A. germinans may have profound implications for ecological and evolutionary processes of mangroves and enables a better understanding of ecosystem function and its conservation. Further studies are needed to investigate such interactions and their implications including long-term monitoring of interstitial salinity and leaf chemistry at different stages of growth and maturity of the host species.",buckeye butterflies; invertebrate herbivory; Laguna Madre of Tamaulipas; mangrove; trophic interactions,2022,37,3,10.1111/1442-1984.12372,0913-557X,22,154,211,1452,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY,"The role of leaf cutting and fire on extrafloral nectaries and nectar production in Stryphnodendron adstringens (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) plants","Herbivory pressure is an important ecological aspect to determine quantitative variation in plant defenses, such as the number of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and their nectar amount and quality. Extrafloral nectaries can attract ants, which can be considered a type of induced plant defense. Besides, plants tend to invest more in defense when they are more vulnerable to herbivores. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate if Stryphnodendron adstringens (Fabaceae), a common Cerrado tree species, when subjected to damage (by manual leaf cutting and experimental fire) would produce a greater number of EFNs and changes its nectar quality on newly produced leaves in comparison with plants not subjected to these treatments. Leaf damage was performed artificially directly on the plant branches and at the entire plant canopy (by means of scissors or fire events). Extrafloral nectary density was higher in new leaves produced after the treatment application (artificial herbivory and fire) in comparison with plants under control treatment. The amount of nectar was also higher under treatments in comparison with control, with a significant change on nectar quality in plants subjected to the treatments of artificial herbivory. The results provided support for the hypothesis that EFNs are an inducible defensive strategy in S. adstringens, confirming the existence of phenotypic plasticity given environmental pressures.",artificial damage; experiments; frequent fire; nectar production; optimal defense hypothesis,2022,37,4,10.1111/1442-1984.12373,0913-557X,19,142,210,1419,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,"Chloroplast phylogenies of Australasian Gleichenia ferns (Gleicheniaceae) reveal incongruence with current taxonomy, and frequent long-distance dispersal","Gleichenia (Gleicheniaceae) is a genus of distinctive branching ferns well represented in Australasia (Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand) where seven of the total eleven species occur. Published chloroplast phylogenies have shown that G. dicarpa is polyphyletic in New Zealand, and that one species from Madagascar and Reunion previously included in Gleichenia represented a separate newly-recognised genus, Rouxopteris. Here, chloroplast rbcL, trnL-trnF and combined trnL-trnF and rps4-trnS phylogenies are produced for all Australasian species. Australasian species formed a clade sister to the type of Gleichenia, G. polypodioides, confirming their placement in Gleichenia. Gleichenia dicarpa occurred in three major clades, which also contained other species or undescribed forms. The three separate lineages of G. dicarpa were morphologically distinct from these other species or forms; however, the three separate chloroplast lineages of G. dicarpa are difficult to morphologically distinguish from each other. Further study is required to elucidate whether the polyphyly of G. dicarpa could be due to unrecognised cryptic species, hybridisation, or incomplete lineage sorting. Low rbcL variation between all Australasian species suggests a radiation in the last five million years and at least six long-distance dispersal events in Australasia are inferred, comprising five between Australia and New Zealand, and one between Australia and New Caledonia.",Cryptic species; Hybridisation; Incomplete lineage sorting; Rouxopteris; Species limits; Tangle ferns,2022,308,4,10.1007/s00606-022-01818-y,0378-2697,16,153,205,1468,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,"Ecological and evolutionary aspects of seed coat and seedling development in Juncus tenuis (Juncaceae, Poales)","This work aimed to understand ecological and evolutionary aspects of Juncus tenuis (Juncaceae) by analyzing its seed coat and seedling development. Mature seeds were germinated under controlled conditions and analyzed every 24 h for 60 days. Seeds and seedlings at different developmental stages were analyzed using a stereomicroscope, light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The seed coat consists of the endotegmen, endotesta, and exotesta. The endotegmen is tanniferous, and the exotesta is mucilaginous. The germination percentage was low (28\%), a result that may be related to specific light, humidity, and temperature requirements to overcome dormancy. Germination begins with the disruption of the seed coat and the emergence of a phaneromer, followed by the development of the collar rhizoids and the primary root. The anatomical analyses show that the formation of shoot and root apical meristems occurs only after the elongation of the phaneromer. The anatomy of the seedlings at early development is described for the first time for the family. The phaneromeric cotyledon is shared by Juncaceae and Thurniaceae and is most likely the ancestral condition in the cyperid clade (Poales). The presence of a mucilaginous exotesta is probably related to seed protection, dispersal, and germination.",Cotyledon; Germination; Mucilaginous exotesta; Phaneromer; Seed coat,2022,308,5,10.1007/s00606-022-01825-z,0378-2697,15,110,196,1316,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,"Exocarp structure in the genus Atraphaxis (Polygonaceae, Polygoneae)","Exocarp anatomy of 30 species of Atraphaxis has been studied to shed light on possible diagnostic and phylogenetic significance of carpological characters. The diversity of the exocarp structure observed in Atraphaxis was comparable to that in the entire tribe Polygoneae. The size of the exocarp cells, the size and shape of the lumen and its branching were the most variable. The radial size of the exocarp cells and the thickening of the walls determined the size and shape of the lumen in the exocarp cells of ripe fruits. The occurrence of the types of the exocarp cells among species of Atraphaxis only partly confirmed an earlier morphology-based division of the genus into three sections. Optimizations of the evolution of exocarp characters using parsimony on plastid phylogeny of Atraphaxis showed homoplastic changes in many characters and the absence of subclades with unique synapomorphies. Some new species identified using plastid data were confirmed by exocarp characters. Species with thick exocarp are distributed mainly in mountain regions of Central Asia, whereas species with thin exocarp are widespread in steppes and semi-deserts of Eurasia. Fruit coloration associated with the amount of phenolic compounds in the exocarp cells might be related to differences in the timing of seed germination. Species with light-brown fruits are widespread, while those with dark or black fruits are mostly local endemics.",Evolution; Exocarp; Fruit anatomy; Fruit morphology; Fruit surface; Pericarp; Phylogeny,2022,308,5,10.1007/s00606-022-01824-0,0378-2697,8,68,221,1431,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,Identification of differential abundance of satellite DNA sequences in Asclepias (Apocynaceae): in-depth characterization of species-specific sequences,"Satellite DNA is a class of tandemly repetitive sequences characterized by rapid evolution and high intra- and inter-specific diversification and is usually the major component of the constitutive heterochromatin. We investigated the abundance of the satDNA in 77 species of Asclepias from Americas, a genus of the Apocynaceae family. De novo identification of the most abundant satDNA sequences was performed using Tandem Repeat Analyzer and Repeat Explorer pipelines. The abundance of satDNA in 77 species was determined using mapping reads, and the correlation between the abundance of satDNAs and clades on the phylogeny tree was estimated by lambda statistics using phytools R package. The repetitive sequences in Asclepias were mostly constitutive by transposable elements, ranged 11.11 to 16.32\%. The satDNA ranged 0.985 to 7.732\% and we obtained 12 satDNA sequences (call Sat1 to Sat12), being for the Sat1 we obtained seven families distributed across all species. The Sat2, Sat3, and families of Sat1 showed significant correlations with the topologies of the phylogenetic tree, among which some families of satDNAs displayed varying abundances across the main clades. We concluded that Asclepias is characterized by many satDNAs, and that the abundance of satDNAs is in accordance with the phylogeny and geographical distribution.",Asclepias; Repetitive DNA; satDNA; Tandem repeats,2022,308,6,10.1007/s00606-022-01832-0,0378-2697,16,151,200,1343,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Polymorphae (Oxalidaceae) there are currently 12 accepted species, mostly from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, but the historical recognition of some infraspecific taxa may have resulted in underscored species richness. Integrated analyses of additional types of data are critical to evaluate if some taxa would be better recognized at species level. To evaluate this, we carried out leaf morphoanatomical analysis of O. neuwiedii subsp. neuwiedii and O. neuwiedii subsp. pardoensis and a phylogenetic analysis of nrITS sequences. Both leaf morphoanatomy and phylogenetics lend support to recognize O. neuwiedii subsp. pardoensis at species level. Leaflet venation pattern, epidermal cell outline, hair-covering, vascular conformation of the pulvina, and tissue organization in the midvein were the main morphoanatomical diagnostic features for the recognition of two species instead of a single one.

In this paper, we describe two Hippeastrum species native to localities directly involved in the tragedy. The dam was located in the foothills of Serra do Caraca, a mountain range in the state of Minas Gerais, from where we describe the endemic H.carassense; H.velloziflorum was first found on an inselberg located on the banks of the Doce River, in the neighboring state of Espirito Santo. Comments on their distribution, ecology, and phenology are provided, as well as comparisons with the most similar taxa. The conservation status of the two new species is preliminarily assessed, and both are considered threatened with extinction. We also compared their leaf anatomy and micromorphology with related species of Amaryllidaceae. Based on nrDNA ITS, we infer the phylogenetic position of H.velloziflorum, a taxon with several unique morphological characters for Hippeastrum, as the first branch in subgenus Hippeastrum. The placement of H.velloziflorum in Hippeastrum is also supported by anatomical and cytological data. The somatic chromosome number was 2n = 22, and the karyotype formula was 2n = 8m + 12sm + 2st chromosome pairs.

PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,Phylogenetic relationships and migration patterns of the Fargesia spathacea complex inferred from genomic data,"Recent molecular research has revealed the significance of hybridization and reticulate evolution in the evolution of temperate woody bamboos at both intergeneric and intrageneric levels. Although the monophyly of Fargesia s.l. is debated, species of Fargesia s.l. with the spathe-like leaf sheath syndrome form a clade as the Fargesia spathacea complex. A previous study showed varying degrees of genetic diversity and an excess of heterozygotes across the F. spathacea complex, but phylogenetic relationships within this complex remain unclear. Here, we sampled 24 populations and 72 individuals of the F. spathacea complex and three outgroups: Yushania confusa, Fargesia setosa, and Bashania fargesii. Using phylogenomic data, we generated a robust phylogeny and explored the implications of the phylogeny for previous hybridization and introgression hypotheses. The phylogenetic analyses suggested that the 72 individuals were clustered into four major clades consistent with the genetic structure but different from the statistical results of vegetative traits. Our phylogenetic and biographical evidence demonstrate that the species in the F. spathacea complex originated outside the Hengduan Mountains region and spread to heterogeneous mountain habitats in the Daba and Qinling Mountains. In addition, adaptive radiation to cold climates and reticulate evolution may have driven species diversification within the F. spathacea complex, making it difficult to classify at the population level.",Biogeography; Fargesia spathacea complex; Gene flow; Phylogenetic relationships; Whole-genome resequencing data,2022,308,5,10.1007/s00606-022-01819-x,0378-2697,14,110,211,1500,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,(Poly)phenols of apples contribute to in vitro antidiabetic properties: Assessment of Canada's Apple Biodiversity Collection,"Societal Impact Statement Apples are affordable and accessible fruit with tremendous biodiversity. Among over 10,000 identified apple cultivars, only a few are commercially available. Habitual fruit consumption is correlated with the prevention of Type 2 diabetes and related complications. Particularly, (poly)phenols found in apples are major contributors to their antidiabetic properties. Here, we have screened (poly)phenol-rich extracts of 476 apple accessions in Canada's Apple Biodiversity Collection for antidiabetic properties. The results of this work provide insights into the prevention and management of Type 2 diabetes by identifying high (poly)phenol-containing specialty apples for use in fresh fruit form or value-added functional food ingredients. Summary The recent trend in sedentary lifestyles and nutritionally-imbalanced diets has elevated the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in many parts of the world. Some pharmacological glycemic management can cause undesirable gastrointestinal side effects or hypoglycemia. Thus, there is a growing interest in safe glycemic management using dietary (poly)phenols. In this study, (poly)phenol-rich extracts of 476 apple accessions from Canada's Apple Biodiversity Collection (ABC) and six major apple (poly)phenols were assessed for in vitro antidiabetic properties against the activities of alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE). Apple (poly)phenol extracts varied in their antidiabetic activities in a dose-dependent manner. High (poly)phenol-containing apples demonstrated that their total phenolic contents (TPC) were inversely correlated with the IC50 values of alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and AGE formation, but not DPP-4. Concentrations of major (poly)phenol compounds such as procyanidin B2, phloridzin, and epicatechin in apples were significantly inversely correlated with IC50 values of alpha-glucosidase in the high (poly)phenol-containing apples. High TPC apples are not suitable for marketing for fresh fruit consumption due to bitterness and astringency; however, these apples show potential to use in the development of value-added functional food ingredients or nutraceuticals for blood glucose management.

PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,A method for making Red List assessments with herbarium data and distribution models for species-rich plant taxa: Lessons from the Neotropical genus Guatteria (Annonaceae),"Societal Impact Statement Despite its importance, biodiversity is declining rapidly. To adequately prioritise conservation efforts, we need to know how threatened species actually are. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List is the most widely recognised tool for assessing extinction risk. Unfortunately, many lesser-known species are not yet represented, such as those that are rarely collected or are in species-rich taxon groups. This is potentially due to low data availability, although Red List assessments can still be made with little data. We present a method to rapidly assess the conservation status of species that have low data availability, which will speed up the inclusion of species from large groups into the IUCN Red List. center dot The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List is the most widely recognised tool to assess the extinction risk of species. For it to be effective in directing conservation effort, it is important that as many species as possible are represented, but many are unfortunately not. A lack of data is often the main reason for this, especially for lesser-studied species. However, this does not mean assessments cannot be made. center dot We examine the use of georeferenced herbarium data in combination with species distribution modelling for assessing plants on the IUCN Red List, with Guatteria (Annonaceae), a genus of Neotropical trees, as a case study. We focus on differences between preliminary and officially published assessments, show the final conservation status of all Guatteria species and provide a roadmap for compiling Red List assessments for species-rich plant groups in the future. center dot We found that species-distribution models aid in compiling Red List assessments, especially for taxa that lack data, but expert opinion remains an important source of information. Half of Guatteria species (48.0\%) are Least Concern, and 13.1\% of species are near threatened or threatened. The remaining species are Data Deficient or Not Evaluated. Most of our preliminary assessments remained unchanged upon review and publication on the IUCN Red List. center dot Our method allows for assessing a large group of taxa in a relatively short amount of time.

PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,An ecological and evolutionary perspective of the historical US nursery flora,"Societal Impact Statement The plants sold in nurseries directly influence urban landscapes by providing habitat that supports humans and other organisms and indirectly influence the natural landscape by acting as a major source of invasive species. We analyzed the ornamental plants sold in US nurseries from 1719 to 1946 and found broad patterns of increasing diversity occurring in step with an increase in species relatedness, a switch from native to alien species, and a decrease in regional distinctness. Patterns like these, which have been observed recently in urban areas, thus have a basis in cultivation/horticultural history. Summary center dot Cultivated plants are foundational species in urban areas, where they simultaneously provide essential ecosystem services while posing a risk of invasion into natural communities. We sought to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of cultivated plants using historical data to better understand the origins of the patterns of diversity observed in present-day human-dominated landscapes. center dot Using records of 5098 ornamental vascular plant species available in 319 US nursery catalogs published from 1719 to 1946, we quantified the taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha\$\$ \textbackslash{}alpha \$\$-diversity, phylogenetic structure, and beta\$\$ \textbackslash{}beta \$\$-diversity of the historical US nursery flora in cultural regions, biomes, latitudinal bands, and longitudinal zones. center dot We showed a peaked increase in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the US nursery flora over time, concurrent with the proliferation of nurseries and the addition of new species to nursery offerings. However, standardized phylogenetic diversity showed a convex pattern, with a trough during a time of peak growth and connectivity in the nursery industry, and diversity actually decreased at the end of the time series. We also showed a pattern of increasing homogenization of regional nursery floras, as well as a shift from offering predominately native to predominately alien species. center dot Echos of the history of the US nursery industry can be found today in patterns with great ecological relevance.

PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal-induced tolerance is determined by fungal identity and pathogen density,"Societal Impact Statement Plant-parasitic nematodes are a major concern for global food security, and many existing control options are being phased out due to adverse impacts on the environment. Here, we show that although application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increases host tolerance to these parasites, these benefits decrease as the parasite burden increases, limiting long-term benefits. This effect was consistent between experiments in the glasshouse and in the field environment, demonstrating the relevance of research into usable technologies. Our findings have potential to aid decision making regarding application of AMF inocula for optimum results in agricultural systems. Plant-parasitic nematodes are a leading global threat to crop production and food security aims. Control strategies based on nematicides and fertilisers are increasingly undesirable due to economic and environmental impacts. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may induce host tolerance against pests such as the potato cyst nematode (PCN). Here, we determined the impact of PCN density on the tolerance induced by AMF-host interactions. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of five AMF inocula on PCN fitness though glasshouse and field trials. Greater PCN densities reduce the increased tolerance that AMF may confer on their hosts. This may be due to reduced mycorrhizal colonisation of hosts under higher PCN infection and potentially a threshold at which the presence of PCN severely impacts fungal growth. When tested in the field, the outcomes of AMF inoculation on crop yields were still positive. Inoculation of soil in the field also increased PCN multiplication, suggesting that AMF-induced tolerance may become reduced in the near future when the threshold PCN density is reached. Addition of AMF to agricultural soils may provide a short-term benefit yet lead to a long-term detriment by increasing PCN populations. The effects observed were driven by only one out of the five introduced AMF species, indicating that the remaining species were redundant for this application. This raises important considerations for future application of AMF inocula in agricultural systems and aids our understanding of how widely used `beneficial' soil amendments impact the agricultural ecosystem.",arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; food security; plant-parasitic nematode; potato; potato cyst nematode; soil community; symbiosis; tolerance,2023,5,2,10.1002/ppp3.10338,NA,12,101,337,2298,8,NA,250,8,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Breeding and selection of taro (Colocasia esculenta) for improved disease-resistance in Hawai'i,"Societal Impact Statement Taro is a root crop with wide geographic range and high cultural significance to Indigenous peoples of Hawai'i and the Pacific. Taro Leaf Blight (TLB) is a worldwide disease of taro, and Hawaiian taro varieties exhibited little resistance to it. To improve TLB-resistance, conventional breeding was conducted by hand-pollination. Out of similar to 3500 taro seedlings, 18 varieties were selected and evaluated under non-flooded conditions at four locations in Hawai'i over 5 years. Four varieties were identified as high yielding and disease-resistant. Further, to prevent confusion of new taro varieties with traditional Hawaiian taro, we developed DNA fingerprints to differentiate them. Taken together, these results have provided information regarding new plant material and new tools for those interested in conservation and breeding across the Pacific. Summary Breeding and evaluation of taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott) was conducted in Hawai'i to increase resistance to Taro Leaf Blight (TLB), caused by oomycete pathogen Phytophthora colocasiae Racib., while maintaining high yields and desirable eating qualities. When breeding Indigenous crops such as taro, it is important to consider issues of Indigenous, intellectual property rights. In response to concerns by cultural practitioners about potential confusion of new taro genotypes with traditional landraces, we also sought to develop DNA fingerprints using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify the new genotypes. Conventional breeding of taro was conducted by hand-pollination of Hawaiian taro landraces with sources of TLB-resistance from multiple countries. The most promising lines were multiplied and evaluated under upland (i.e., non-flooded) conditions on four major Hawaiian Islands over 5 years. DNA was extracted from these new genotypes, analyses of SNPs conducted, and results compared to those of traditional Hawaiian landraces. Bayesian yield analysis of these multi-year and multi-location trials identified taro genotypes 1016-003, 1016-019, 1024-215, and 1005-084 as producing twice the fresh weight corm yield as control ``Maui Lehua{'' and exhibiting disease-resistance across years and environments. DNA fingerprints of new genotypes were able to differentiate them from traditional Hawaiian landraces that make up a portion of their parentage. Conventional breeding of taro in Hawai'i and multi-year, multi-location field trials have resulted in high yielding, disease-resistant genotypes that maintain desirable qualities of some traditional Hawaiian landraces.

PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Data sharing for conservation: A standardized checklist of US native tree species and threat assessments to prioritize and coordinate action,"Societal Impact Statement Understanding the current state of trees within the United States is imperative for protecting those species, their habitats, and the countless communities they support, as well as the ecosystem services they provide. We present an updated checklist of all tree species native to the contiguous United States, their state distribution, extinction risk, and most common threats. Knowledge of national threat ``hotspots{''} and conservation priorities facilitates efficient conservation efforts and the allocation of resources to safeguard the 11-16\% of US tree species that are threatened. These results lay the groundwork for tree and ecosystem conservation efforts in the United States that contribute to achieving critical international conservation goals, including the United Nations Decade for Ecosystem Restoration and the Global Tree Assessment. The Global Tree Assessment aims to complete threat assessments for all the world's similar to 60,000 tree species, but most species native to the continental United States had either never been assessed or were outdated on the two most widely used threat assessment platforms in the United States, International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and NatureServe. There was also no coordinated mechanism for sharing data between these platforms, resulting in missing, duplicated, or outdated information. We (1) created an updated checklist of all tree species native to the contiguous United States based on the standardized Global Tree Assessment tree definition, (2) created over 700 new or updated IUCN Red List assessments and NatureServe Global Ranks, and (3) developed a replicable assessment data sharing process. We present an updated checklist of native US trees that includes 881 species from 269 genera, with Quercus and Crataegus as the most species-rich tree genera. We present the first country-wide analysis of tree extinction risk, patterns of geographic and taxonomic diversity, and leading threats. An estimated 11-16\% of US tree species are threatened with extinction, with the most common threat being invasive and problematic pests and diseases. We introduce a ``crosswalk{'' process for efficient, large-scale data sharing between the IUCN Red List and NatureServe, using IUCN Red List Species Information Service (SIS) Connect, which can be applied to other taxonomic groups in North America.

PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Development of single nucleotide polymorphism markers and genetic diversity in guava (Psidium guajava L.),"Societal impact statement There are many understudied fruits of great economic and productive importance for regional agricultural hubs. Guava is an American fruit species with attractive nutritional and adaptability characteristics. However, in many countries like Mexico, its cultivation is still limited to small-to-medium size plantings and home gardens and depends on poorly controlled germplasm that diminishes productivity and expansion. Our study provides valuable insight to better understand guava diversity and generate high-yielding, high-quality, and better adapted materials. Supporting the study and development of understudied crops will provide us with more resources for facing climate change adversities and for diversifying cropping systems. Summary Guava (Psidium guajava L.) is a fruit crop species native to tropical and subtropical regions of America with great productive and economic potential due to its extensive environmental adaptability, nutritional value, and medicinal properties. However, the lack of molecular resources for accelerated breeding, limited knowledge about its evolutionary and domestication history, and unfavorable policies have limited its genetic improvement and broader adoption as a commercial fruit crop. Here, we present the first diversity study in guava employing genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Forty-eight accessions collected from Mexico and other continents were examined with more than 6000 high-quality SNP markers, which represents a marker density increase of similar to 30x compared with previous studies. Relationships between genetic groupings and geographic origins were not apparent in this diverse guava collection using principal component and structure analyses. Extensive germplasm exchange among guava-producing regions and limited varietal control at commercial plantations might have contributed to ambiguities when defining the true origin and identities of existing germplasm materials. However, an analysis of domestication syndrome traits (fruit size and sugar) by wild or improved germplasm revealed several putative genomic regions under selection. Knowledge about germplasm origins and genetic relatedness, in conjunction with reliable molecular resources and better agronomic practices, is necessary to support breeding efforts and facilitate broader adoption of orphan crops such as guava, which have increasingly important roles in light of climate change adversities and in diversifying diets and food systems.",conservation; fruit crop; genotyping-by-sequencing; Myrtaceae; Psidium,2023,5,1,10.1002/ppp3.10295,NA,14,105,339,2519,5,NA,250,8,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Ecological legacies of past fire and human activity in a Panamanian forest,"Societal Impact StatementTropical forests provide global ecosystem services and harbor much of Earth's terrestrial biodiversity, but the mechanisms driving the patterns of biodiversity remain uncertain. Palms are one of the most abundant and most widely used plant groups, particularly in the Neotropics. Our data highlight how both direct and indirect human influence that occurred decades to hundreds of years ago can affect the abundances of palm species in modern tropical forests. Our results highlight that biodiversity is dynamic, and changes through time, and that human activities can affect species composition for centuries in tropical forests. Human activities over the past decades and centuries, including fire, cultivation, and forest opening, may have left ecological legacies that persist in modern tropical forests, particularly among palms. We investigated whether past human activities affected modern palm abundances in a well-studied plot located in a tropical semievergreen forest of Panama.We analyzed soil cores for charcoal to reconstruct past fire events and phytoliths to reconstruct past vegetation changes. We dated as many charcoal fragments as possible to place a temporal framework on past fire events.Our analysis documented widespread fires that occurred 600-900 years ago across the plot. Oenocarpus mapora increased in abundance as a result of these fires, though other palms did not. A subsequent increase in O. mapora occurred later in the relative absence of fire and was likely due to game hunting during the construction of the Panama Canal.Our results showed that the enrichment of O. mapora was determined by disturbance characteristics (e.g., timing, type, and intensity), but the persistence of increased abundances was likely determined by traits (life history characteristics).

PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Effects of nitrogen deposition on carbon allocation between wood and leaves in temperate forests,"Societal Impact Statement Increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition represents a major global change factor, but its long-term effect on tree growth and carbon (C) sequestration remains uncertain. Our manipulation experiment and meta-analysis reveal that N deposition in temperate and boreal forests promoted tree growth and the allocation of more C into wood than into leaves in China and worldwide. Thus, N deposition may increase forest C sequestration through enhanced wood production and distribution of C into stable sinks. In the context of achieving ``Carbon Neutrality,{''} understanding how N deposition affect long-term forest C sinks will help us with mitigation strategies under climate change. Increased nitrogen (N) deposition is driving many temperate and boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere towards N saturation. However, it is uncertain how long-term N deposition affects tree growth and carbon (C) allocation in these forests. To investigate this, we treated temperate larch and mixed forests in northeastern China with N additions for 8 years. In addition, we collected data from 25 N-addition experiments in temperate and boreal forests worldwide to reveal the overall effects of N on tree growth and C allocation. Nitrogen additions significantly promoted total biomass increment by 24\% in both study forests, with on average additional 8 kg C per kg N gain into woody biomass over the study period. Nitrogen additions increased the ratio of woody biomass increment to foliage litterfall production in the larch forest (by 34\%). Literature data analysis also revealed greater N promotion on wood (24\%) over foliage (9\%) production. However, the positive effect on foliage diminished over time. These results combined imply that N deposition may promote tree growth in temperate and boreal regions and drive proportionally more photosynthate allocation into wood than leaves, thus may enhance forest C sequestration in the long run.",carbon allocation; C-N response; litterfall production; nitrogen deposition; temperate forests; tree growth; woody biomass increment,2023,5,2,10.1002/ppp3.10341,NA,14,96,296,1968,7,NA,250,8,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Epistatic modifiers influence the expression of continual flowering in strawberry,"Society Impact Statement Until the 1970s, the majority of commercial strawberry varieties produced a single bloom of flowers. However, continuously flowering, everbearing strawberries are now routinely cultivated and use is increasing. Indeed, introgression of the everbearing flowering trait can lead to economic benefits for growers through the production of a continual crop from the same plant. Genetically guided improvement has the power to streamline everbearing generation. As such, the genetic markers reported here can help to identify everbearing individuals at an early time point in the breeding process. Furthermore, these markers can help to improve the predictions of progeny segregation ratios. Previous work within the community led to the identification of a single dominant allele that controls the everbearing trait. However, frequent observations have indicated that crosses do not segregate in a Mendelian fashion, as would be expected for a trait controlled by a single dominant gene. Therefore, it was hypothesised that one or more unidentified epistatic alleles interact with the major gene. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on 587 June bearers and 207 everbearers to assess the genetic components associated with flowering habit. The segregation ratios of parental strawberry lines with known phenotypes were used to validate the identified alleles. Three loci including the known major FaPFRU locus and two epistatic modifiers were identified. These modifiers function as enhancers of the everbearing trait in individuals containing a single copy of the FaPFRU everbearing allele and appear to be functionally redundant. Principally, heterozygous individuals required the presence of two modifying alleles in order to allow expression of the everbearing trait. Inclusion of the epistatic alleles improved the prediction of everbearing segregation ratios; beyond that of a single allele model, however, a large proportion of the variation remained unexplained. Future work should identify the additional repressor and enhancer modifiers not identified here. Discovering the genetic components controlling the everbearing trait can enable genetic informed strawberry improvement.",epistasis; everbearing; flowering time; functional redundancy; genome-wide association study (GWAS); marker-assisted breeding,2023,5,1,10.1002/ppp3.10300,NA,10,81,317,2225,6,NA,250,8,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Integrated conservation of Acer yangbiense: A case study for conservation methods of plant species with extremely small populations,"Societal Impact Statement A practical and efficient model is crucial for applying conservation actions to threatened species. Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations (PSESP) is a new concept raised jointly by government and scientists from China, targeted toward funding the urgent rescue of threatened plants. With the cooperation of decision-making departments, scientists, local departments, nongovernment organizations, and local people, we present a case of how the tree species Acer yangbiense was studied and finally rescued. The pipeline and experience in this case will promote the development of the PSESP conservation methods. With only five individuals known for years, the Critically Endangered species Acer yangbiense was listed under the conservation category Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations (PSESP), a concept developed 10 years ago in China, aimed at channeling limited resources to conserve the most threatened plant species. Integrated conservation methods and research were applied to A. yangbiense and introduced in two-time phases upon the discovery of new populations. Being considered one of the most successfully rescued species, A. yangbiense was removed from the second PSESP list issued in 2021 by Yunnan Province, China. The conservation case has become a model, with replicable pipelines, standards, cooperation, and studies to future PSESP conservation actions.

PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Meta-analysis of Red List conservation assessments of Mexican endemic and near endemic tree species shows nearly two thirds of these are threatened,"Societal Impact Statement Mexico's extraordinary tree diversity is threatened by the increasing demand for resources because of the tenfold population growth in the last century. The conservation status of trees and both urban and rural livelihoods are also negatively affected by agriculture, mining and tourism. Nearly 60\% of the Mexican endemic and near endemic tree species whose conservation status we have assessed for the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature are threatened, almost double the percentage of threatened trees worldwide. If no measures are taken to protect this tree diversity properly, these resources will be forever lost for human sustainability. Mexico is floristically the fourth most species-rich country in the world. Currently, 3620 native tree species are reported from this country. Mexico has been a forerunner at global level in recognising the need for plant conservation, yet this is in stark contrast with governmental programmes and actions, past and present that negatively affect(ed) immense areas of primary vegetation. In the framework of the Global Tree Assessment, to date, we have assessed the conservation status of nearly 1500 Mexican endemic and near endemic tree species for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, the distribution data of which we use here for a first meta-analysis of conservation statuses and spatial distribution patterns in a newly delimited area we call Natural Mexico. Our database consists of 112,416 taxonomically and geographically very carefully curated distribution points of 1474 tree species endemic to Mexico and adjacent areas, belonging to 98 flowering plant families. The extensive curation methodology we consider essential for both research and conservation purposes is emphasised. Nearly 60\% of the assessed tree species are threatened, almost double the percentage of threatened arborescent species at global level. Tropical rainforests and cloud forests house the highest proportions of threatened trees. These assessments have an extensive impact, as they not only are the starting point of urgent species conservation actions but also allow for comprehensive studies including extinction risk estimation, gap analyses for conservation planning and species reintroductions, all this in a framework of land use change, climate change and landscape composition and configuration.",arborescent species; biodiversity conservation; data curation; International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List; livelihoods; Natural Mexico; natural resources; taxonomy,2023,5,"4, SI",10.1002/ppp3.10308,NA,22,147,357,2426,8,NA,250,8,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Pedigree reconstruction for triploid apple cultivars using single nucleotide polymorphism array data,"Societal Impact Statement Many economically, culturally, and historically important apple cultivars are triploids, which have three copies of each chromosome instead of the more typical two copies in diploids. Despite their prevalence and importance, there have been conflicting reports regarding their origin and their ability to beget diploids. New genetic analysis methodologies outlined in this study have clarified the genetic origin of triploid apple cultivars and suggest that triploidy has been a dead end in historic apple pedigrees. The specific results of this study have resolved the pedigrees of many cultivars, including the famous English cultivar Cox's Orange Pippin and the oldest known US cultivar Roxbury Russet. In apple (Malus x domestica), most cultivars are diploid, though a sizeable number are triploids, which tend to be stronger growing, more robust, and bear larger fruit. However, triploidy is also associated with strongly reduced fertility. Some recorded pedigrees for historical apple cultivars include triploids as parents of diploids, despite this reputation of poor fertility. This information, coupled with some initiatives using triploids in breeding efforts, result in confusion about how possible or common it is for triploids to be parents of diploid offspring. To date, no studies have systematically evaluated and identified pedigrees of triploid apple cultivars to resolve these contradictions. Here, we describe a method to make triploid genotype calls using Illumina Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data through a novel Python script: ploidyClassifier. SNP data for 219 unique triploids was compared alongside 2498 unique diploid apple accessions to conduct pedigree reconstruction. Unreduced gamete-donating parents were identified for over half of the triploid accessions. From those, reduced gamete-donating parents were identified for nearly half. Full or partial pedigrees for many classic triploids were uncovered, including that of the oldest known American cultivar, `Roxbury Russet'. All tested pedigrees from literature that listed triploids as parents of diploids were deemed false, including that of the well-known `Cox's Orange Pippin', whose previously unreported second parent was also identified here as `Rosemary Russet'. These results together suggest that historic triploids are mostly or solely the product of diploid parentage and that triploidy has been a dead end in historic apple pedigrees.",apple; genetics; Malus; pedigree reconstruction; polyploidy; single nucleotide polymorphism array; triploid,2023,5,1,10.1002/ppp3.10313,NA,12,100,357,2480,7,NA,250,8,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Phenotypic characterization of a strawberry (Fragaria xananassa Duchesne ex Rosier) diversity collection,"Societal Impact statement To secure a stable, safe food supply, the future of humanity depends on the conservation and application of cultivated and wild plant diversity. Strawberries are globally important. They are widely produced and provide significant human health benefits. In 2019, annual world production was 14.5 MT (FAOSTAT, 2022). This report characterizes agricultural traits of diverse heritage strawberries. The gene pool of breeding programs has traditionally included a reliable but limited set of cultivars. The traits of lesser known heritage strawberry cultivars and selections examined by our study could be of value in expanding gene pools by tapping into existing cultivated genetic diversity. Strawberries are a berry crop of global significance. We present a comprehensive evaluation of strawberry diversity through phenotyping 284 strawberry cultivars from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Clonal Germplasm Repository Corvallis, Oregon, USA. We assessed 284 cultivars in 2019 and 2020 for quantified variation across 16 traits, including phenology, plant morphology, and fruit quality traits at full ripeness. Through cluster analysis, we determined groups of accessions that had desirable traits, including quality fruits, earliest fruit ripening, or high numbers of daughter plant production. We observed that this strawberry diversity panel displayed a wide range of phenotypic variation that could prove useful for future strawberry improvement. ORUS 2427-1, NW 90054-37, and ``Independence,{''} each developed by the Oregon USDA breeding program, displayed a combination of the highest fruit quality traits. ``Independence{''} also had the longest runner length and the highest number of daughter plants. Two California cultivars, Oso Grande and Cuesta, and the Oregon cultivar Pinnacle had a short ripening time, on average 32 days between flowering and harvest, with the range for the study group of 25-41 days.

PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET,Raising awareness through the Global Tree Assessment: Extinction risk of six fully assessed tree groups,"Societal Impact Statement Trees are essential to life on earth-playing important economic, ecological and cultural roles. However, the world is facing a biodiversity crisis, and to be able to effectively conserve tree species with limited funds, we need to know which tree species are threatened. The Global Tree Assessment has addressed this gap in knowledge through accelerating the production of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessments. Analysing the results of completed taxonomic groups allows for targeted conservation. Here, we explore the extinction risk of six understudied genera with ethnobotanical uses, allowing for conservation priorities to be set. To highlight the ongoing progress of the Global Tree Assessment, a synthesis of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List data has been produced for six genera (Gilbertiodendron, Humiriastrum, Liquidambar, Nectandra, Teijsmanniodendron and Tilia) which have all their tree species assessed. This was used to analyse the extinction risk within these groups with the aim of setting conservation priorities and raising awareness of genera not previously publicised in the Global Tree Assessment. The genera were chosen based on completeness, in terms of number of tree species with published IUCN Red List assessments. IUCN Red List categories, threats and uses from each species' IUCN Red List assessment were analysed. An ex situ survey was also carried out to identify species found in botanic gardens, arboreta and seed banks. Higher threat levels were found in the predominately tropical genera (Gilbertiodendron, Humiriastrum, Nectandra and Teijsmanniodendron) compared with the broadly more temperate genera (Tilia and Liquidambar). Habitat loss due to agriculture is a major threat in all genera with exploitation also a key threat to Gilbertiodendron and Tilia. Gilbertiodendron, Humiriastrum, Nectandra and Teijsmanniodendron have no threatened species conserved in ex situ collections. We have identified a need for a range of conservation measures, including collecting threatened species of these groups for ex situ conservation, to ensure no species becomes extinct.",conservation prioritisation; Gilbertiodendron; Humiriastrum; International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessments; Liquidambar; Nectandra; Teijsmanniodendron; Tilia,2023,5,"4, SI",10.1002/ppp3.10289,NA,15,103,320,2201,8,NA,250,8,Other structure requirements,275,225,yes,no,yes
POLAR BIOLOGY,A review of leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) births and pups using a standardised age-class classification system,"Despite the ecological importance of leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) as apex marine predators, little is known about their reproductive biology. To address this paucity, we reviewed leopard seal birth and pup records and applied a standardised age-class classification system to differentiate between births/newborns (offspring <= 14 days old) and pups (> 14 days but < 6 months old). We compiled 19 birth/newborn and 141 pup records and examined their occurrence by month, region, substrate, birth-specific attributes (i.e. birth observations, fresh umbilicus or placental), standard length, weight, presence of mother, presence of lanugo, sex, status (e.g. born alive) and fate. These records indicate that leopard seal births occur between September and December, with peak records from September to November, whilst pup records peaked between August and December. The regions with the most birth/newborn records were the sub-Antarctic Islands (31.6\%) and Chile (31.6\%), followed by Antarctica (15.8\%), New Zealand (15.8\%) and the Falkland Islands (5.3\%). Pups were recorded predominantly in the sub-Antarctic Islands (54.6\%), followed by the Antarctic (42.6\%), Chile (2.1\%) and Australia (0.7\%). Whilst leopard seal birth records were predominantly on ice, they were also found on terra firma. The northernmost published leopard seal birth records occurred in New Zealand whilst the northernmost published leopard seal pup records occurred in Australia. This study contradicts the long-standing hypothesis that leopard seals only give birth on Antarctic pack ice, and instead, here we indicate that 84.2\% and 57.4\% of collated leopard seal birth and pup records, respectively, occur outside of Antarctica. Our records illustrate the importance of northern regions as part of the leopard seal's range. We emphasise the need to conduct research focused on the reproductive biology of this keystone species throughout its range and that future management of leopard seal populations should also consider their northern range.",Apex predator; Distribution; Newborn; Phenology; Phocid; Pinniped; Reproduction,2022,45,7,10.1007/s00300-022-03053-0,0722-4060,16,113,296,2039,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
POLAR BIOLOGY,Abundance and activity of sympagic viruses near the Western Antarctic Peninsula,"The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has experienced significant changes in seawater temperature over the past 50 years. This warming affects seawater and sea ice microbial cycling of organic matter, where viral features could play a crucial role in sympagic sea ice melting environments. However, there is a lack of information about the sea ice viral abundances and processes (e.g. lysis rates and carbon release from microorganisms). To gain knowledge of sea ice viral, microbial, and chemical characteristics, we collected four different sea ice samples and their surrounding surface seawater during the Austral summer of 2019 north of the WAP. In each sample, we assessed viral and microbial abundances and environmental parameters. In the sea ice, we also measured viral-driven mortality rates on prokaryotes and protists and the consequent release of organic carbon. The viral and microorganism abundances in the sea ice were higher (4.5 +/- 1.9 x 10(6) viruses mL(-1); 1.5 +/- 0.7 x 10(6) prokaryotes mL(-1), 9.4 +/- 5.0 x 10(2) protists mL(-1)) than in the surrounding surface seawater (1.7 x 10(6) viruses mL(-1), 0.4 x 10(6) prokaryotes mL(-1), 7.1 x 10(2) protists mL(-1)). Furthermore, viral lytic production on prokaryotes (4.5 +/- 0.8 x 10(5) mL(-1)day(-1)) and protists (1.9 +/- 1.0 x 10(4) mL(-1) day(-1)) in sympagic environments had a higher viral impact on carbon release by protist (1.5 +/- 1.1 mu g C L-1 day(-1)) than by prokaryotes (0.3 +/- 0.1 mu g C L-1 day(-1)).

We used length-at-age data to present the species' life history information (age, growth and maturity for the first-time). Length- and age-at-maturity analyses revealed that B.irrasa matured at > 6 years old and > 1000 mm total length (TL), which was older and larger than B.murrayi (> 5 years old and > 400 mm TL) but similar to B.eatonii (> 5 years old and > 900 mm). We fitted growth models using a multi-model Bayesian framework. Our findings support the assumption that B.irrasa is slow growing and late maturing compared to B.eatonii and B.murrayi, consequently putting it at greater risk to fishery-induced increases in mortality compared to other species (e.g., B.murrayi). This is the first-time age and growth has been estimated for these species, however sample sizes for B.murrayi and B.eatonii were small and hence growth models should be interpreted with caution.

POLAR BIOLOGY,Application of underwater imagery for the description of upper sublittoral benthic communities in glaciated and ice-free Arctic fjords,"Complex bottom topography and the presence of floating ice significantly complicate the use of traditional sampling methods in Arctic coastal waters, forcing to look for alternative approaches. One such technique is underwater imagery, which has grown in popularity in recent decades based on its effectiveness in hard-to-reach places. We demonstrate that an underwater video mosaic can be a reliable method for comparative analysis of Arctic habitats under the glacier influence and glacier influence-free habitats. The filming was carried out in the upper sublittoral (2-65 m) of Hornsund and Isfjorden areas, representing two ice-free and two glaciated bays. Video footage was obtained using an ROV mounted and ``drop-down{''} video cameras and transformed into 148 video mosaics. Based on the lowest possible taxonomic level, 31 biological features (morphospecies) were identified and ascribed to benthic functional groups based on their feeding and mobility type. The morphospecies and functional groups were used for the comparative analysis to reveal the ecologically meaningful differences in benthic community structure in different Arctic benthic habitats. We discovered greater abundances of motile scavengers in glacier-influenced bays whereas glacier influence-free bay had more sessile suspension filters and glacier influence-free riverine bay was dominated by discreetly motile and deposit feeders.

In order to explore the diversity of phytoplankton community, especially discover harmful bloom species that never reported in early studies due to the paucity of molecular investigation in the NAP, we collected plankton samples from the north of South Shetland Islands to east of the South Orkney Islands and sequenced their 18S rRNA gene V4 region metabarcoding. The dominate groups in the samples were dinoflagellates, diatoms, cryptophytes, and haptophytes. We discovered 1340 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) associated with the Dinophyceae, and 742 ASVs of which were categorized to the genus or species level using the DINOREF database. Dinophyceae Gyrodinium, Warnowia, Ptychodiscus, Gymnodinium, Karenia, Brachidinium, Polarella, Islandinium, and Scrippsiella were the dominate taxa, accounting for 75 percent of the dinoflagellate reads. Karenia papilionacea and Scrippsiella acuminata were first-ever detected in the NAP, and they might be carried in from outside the Antarctic by shipping activities.

It is especially important at locations which are expected to be largely impacted by climate change, such as Icelandic waters. The present study focuses on the diversity of bryozoan species in Iceland. An Icelandic bryozoan species list was compiled from three main data sources: species collected during the BIOICE programme, species deposited in old museum collections and from literature. A total of 288 species were recorded from the study area, 67 of which are new records in Icelandic waters and three are potentially non-indigenous species. Such diversity is relatively high in comparison to other areas and yet predicted to be even higher if more studies were to be conducted. Encrusting forms (56\%) were by far the most numerous among studied bryozoans. The highest number of species (71) was recorded in the shallowest 0-100 m zone which is most likely a result of complex factors including high primary productivity of that zone. This study reveals a large proportion of new species records for the area, showing how little is known about bryozoan diversity and its ecological aspects in such important areas as Icelandic waters.

Mosses are the dominant benthic primary producers in low-order streams in Greenland, and climate induced ecosystem alterations are expected to cause significant changes to their growth and productivity rates. However, the combined effects of climate change to stream mosses are relatively unknown. In this study, we conducted a full factorial experiment with three levels of nutrients and temperatures, and we measured primary productivity by applying the C-14-CO2 tracer method, relative growth rate (RGR), shoot elongation (SE) and lateral growth (length of branches, LB; Shoot density, SD). We aimed to investigate the single and interactive effect of temperature and nutrient enrichment on growth (biomass and elongation), primary productivity and shoot morphology of the Arctic aquatic moss Hygrohypnella ochracea. We found that low temperature determines H. ochracea growth however, the effect of nutrient enrichment became increasingly significant with increasing temperature. We also found important morphological changes in moss lateral growth which is expected to cause fundamental changes in moss community structure. Our results demonstrated that, in the low-order Arctic streams, climate change will cause shifts in benthic primary productivity, growth and morphology, and these changes are expected to cause cascading effects on the stream ecosystem structure, biodiversity and function.",Arctic streams; Climate change; Aquatic primary productivity; C-14-CO2 tracer method,2022,45,8,10.1007/s00300-022-03077-6,0722-4060,15,112,214,1519,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Hence, the aim of the study is to assess food preferences by the stomach content examination, applying a sophisticated analytical approach. As reported elsewhere, the black rockcod is omnivorous, relying primarily on algae, gastropods, amphipods, euphausiids and fishes, each consumed with different foraging strategies. Based on multidimensional scaling statistical procedures, fish size and water depth are the primarily contributers to prey resource diversification and partitioning.

We found that the micrometazoans inhabiting the algae consist of remarkably abundant bdelloid rotifers (subclass Bdelloidea), followed by tardigrades. We did not find nematodes. The rotifer assemblages were characterized by low diversity (only six species). Nevertheless, rotifer densities were extremely high: mean densities ranged from 75 to 3030 individuals per 100 mg of the dry sample weight and the maximum value num-bered in excess of 8000 per 100 mg of the dry sample weight. These data show that terrestrial algae, along with mosses, are a very attractive habitat for rotifers and tardigrades in the Antarctic.

Eight taxa of HFs were selected for the principal analysis: Telonemia, Picozoa, Rhizaria, Amoebozoa, Apusomonas, Centrohelida, Choanomonada and marine stramenopiles (MASTs). The HFs were defined as heterotrophic picoflagellates (HPFs; 3 mu m) and heterotro-phic nanoflagellates (HNFs; 3 mu m, <20 mu m), which had similar dominant phyla (MASTs and Telonemia). However, their taxonomic composition dif-fered. Environmental factors exerted similar effects on the community struc-ture of both HPFs and HNPs. Compared with the correlation between HPF and environmental factors, the correlation between HNF and environmental fac-tors was stronger. Salinity, bacterial biomass and the biological interactions amongst dominant taxa were the main variables to influence the diversity and community structure of HFs.",Heterotrophic picoflagellates; heterotrophic nanoflagellates; biodiversity; community structure,2021,40,NA,10.33265/polar.v40.5389,0800-0395,14,108,185,1367,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
POLAR RESEARCH,"Historic temperature observations on Nordaustlandet, north-east Svalbard","Long-term meteorological data for the Arctic are sparse. One of the longest quasi-continuous temperature time series in the High Arctic is the extended Svalbard Airport series, providing daily temperature data from 1898 until the present. Here, I derive an adjustment to historic temperature observations on the island of Nordaustlandet, north-east Svalbard, in order to link these to the extended Svalbard Airport series. This includes the Haudegen observations at Rijpfjorden during 1944/45 and a previously unrecognized data set obtained by the Norwegian hunters and trappers Gunnar Knoph and Henry Rudi during their wintering at Rijpfjorden in 1934/35. The adjustment is based on data from an automatic weather station at Rijpfjorden during 2014-16 and verified with other independent historic temperature observations on Nordaustlandet. An analysis of the Haudegen radiosonde data indicates that the surface tempera-ture observations at Rijpfjorden are generally well correlated with the free tro-pospheric temperatures at 850 hPa, but occasionally show the occurrence of boundary-layer inversions during winter, where local temperatures fall sub-stantially below what is expected from the regression. The adjusted historic observations from Nordaustlandet can, therefore, be used to fill remaining gaps in the extended Svalbard Airport series.",Climate change; Arctic amplification; early 20th century warming; hunters' diaries; Henry Rudi; Oxford University Arctic Expedition 1935; 36,2021,40,NA,10.33265/polar.v40.7564,0800-0395,7,72,190,1349,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
POLAR RESEARCH,Minimally invasive physiological correlates of social behaviour in belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) under human care,"Simultaneous observations of reproductive physiology and behaviour were conducted on a group of two male and two female belugas under professionally managed care for one year to explore potential mating strategies. Weekly blow sampling for progesterone in females was used to define the breeding season by detecting three oestrous cycles in one female. Twice weekly blow sampling for testosterone and twice monthly testes measurements via ultrasonography were used to detect reproductive seasonality in both males. Female-male association frequency varied longitudinally, with 70\% of all interactions occurring during the 16-week breeding season. Male-male associations did not vary seasonally. Male display behaviours towards the female occurred 14.8 times more frequently during the breeding season (0.164 +/- 0.188 behaviours/min) than outside of the breeding season (0.011 +/- 0.042 behaviours/min). The cycling female responded variably to male display behaviours by altering swim speed or body orientation towards the male. Although this small sample size limits broad conclusions, the frequent display behaviours, low copulation rate and lack of serious male-male aggression are consistent with predictions for pre-copulatory female mate choice developed from the current knowledge of beluga reproductive physiology. These observations, which are not feasible for wild belugas, provide important management considerations because reduced opportunities for mate choice could limit the reproductive rate, especially in small populations.",Reproduction; cetacean; mating strategies; blow; steroid hormones; aquarium,2021,40,NA,10.33265/polar.v40.5504,0800-0395,14,115,212,1543,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

We present estimates of standing stock of Carbon from every species, as well as the entire copepod community from this region during austral summer. Of the total copepod community, Rhincalanus gigas (13.397 mgC) contributed the most to C stock, followed by Calanus australis (5.269 mgC) and Calocalanus sp (1.027 mgC).

Herein we systematically investigate brecciated chondrites to efficiently and quickly classify large numbers of breccias that are housed in organizations such as the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR). We observed 1024 chondrites in the NIPR collection only by using optical microscopy. Many terms have been proposed to describe breccias. In order to classify breccias in a short time, we propose a determinative chart only by optical microscopy from terminology previously proposed and our observations. Fragmental breccias consist of primordial lithology as a clast or a host among fragmental fine-grained minerals. If the lithology is apparently consistent throughout, it is considered a monomict breccia. Otherwise, it is provisionally called a fragmental breccia. Breccias can be classified according to evidence of in situ melting.

For SuperDARN Syowa East (SYE) and Kerguelen (KER) radars that intersect with ZHS, a data set comprised of adjacent range gates from nearest radar beams is used. Digisonde ion drift measurements were projected onto the direction of co-located and concurrent line-of-sight SuperDARN velocities. A comparison of the velocities shows a clear correlation (R = 0.92) between the two data sets. Projected Digisonde velocity was found to be, on average, larger than the line-of-sight SuperDARN radar velocities by a factor of 1.7. Time dependence distributions of Digisonde-SuperDARN SYE radars showed that the larger velocity discrepancies are more located at the dawnside convection cell.

POLAR SCIENCE,Debris-cover impact on glacier melting in the Upper Indus Basin,"Out of 4530 glaciers covering similar to 4770 km(2) in the Upper Indus Basin, viz., Chenab, Zanaskar and Suru sub-basins, we selected topographically and morphologically homogeneous set of 98 glaciers; 56 debris-covered and 42 clean to assess the impact of debris-cover on glacier melting. Satellite data analysis from 2000 to 2017 showed that the debris-covered glaciers have melted slower (2.49 +/- 0.05\%; 0.15\%a(-1)) than the clean glaciers (4.07 +/- 0.03\%; 0.24\%a(-1)). The intra-basin analysis revealed that clean and debris-covered glaciers in the Chenab have melted 2.34 +/- 0.17\% and 1.1 +/- 0.30\% (0.14\%a(-1) and 0.06\%a(-1)) and retreated 8.82 +/- 2.67ma(-1) and 5.7 +/- 2.67ma(-1) respectively. Similarly, clean and debris-covered glaciers in the Zanaskar have melted at similar rates of 4.58 +/- 0.07\% and 4.55 +/- 0.21\% (0.27\%a(-1) and 0.25\%a(-1)) and retreated 10.0 +/- 2.67ma(-1) and 8.4 +/- 2.67ma(-1) respectively.

This study is dedicated to tabular massive ground ice exposed in the outcrop of the thermocirque of the third sea terrace in the Central Yamal Peninsula to establish the mechanism of ice formation and the source of water based on the isotopic signature of ice. The tabular massive ground ice body was opened with visual thickness of 2.5 m and a length of 300 m. It had formed from 43 to 37 cal ka BP according to C-14 AMS-data. A white ice body was found under the visible lower boundary of the studied tabular massive ground ice. Tabular massive ground ice yielded values of delta(18)? from -19.9 to -23.1 parts per thousand and delta H-2 from -151.8 to -164.7 parts per thousand, with variations in deuterium excess from 6.5 to 20.4 parts per thousand (average d(exc) = 13 parts per thousand).

POLAR SCIENCE,"Joint effects of sea ice melt, freshwater discharge and tidal currents on zooplankton abundance in the Sea of Okhotsk: 2004 and 2013","The foremost flooding event of the past century happened in 2013 on the Amur River, which flows into the Sea of Okhotsk. Concurrently, the winter of 2012-2013 was a year of heavy sea ice and delayed onset of melting in this region. To examine the joint effects of these major, regional-scale hydrological freshening events on oceanographic processes, we compared physical (CTD, tides and currents) and biological (zooplankton) data measured in 2004 and 2013 in Academy Bay, Sea of Okhotsk. Our results indicate that the difference in sea water temperature between the two years played a primary role in shaping zooplankton variability. Data collected in 2013 showed that water temperature was colder and that the upper layer was substantially fresher (\~{}4-5 ps mu) than in 2004. This decrease in water temperature and salinity reduction was accompanied by a significant decrease in the abundance of some key zooplankton species including Calanus glacialis, Pseudocalanus spp. and Sagitta elegans and a corresponding increase in the abundance of Limacina helicina. Delayed melting of sea ice in 2013 potentially triggered a mismatch in pelagic production that may have impacted the recruitment of calanoid copepods. Variation in tidal and subtidal advection of cold and highly saline Okhotsk Sea shelf water appears to be an important process influencing regional variation in zooplankton abundance. The occurrence of such hydrological events has the potential to trigger cascading effects through the food web.",Arctic freshening; Sea ice; Sea of Okhotsk; Tidal currents; Zooplankton,2022,31,NA,10.1016/j.polar.2021.100781,1873-9652,22,132,232,1512,5,NA,200,5,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
POLAR SCIENCE,Methane release from open leads and new ice following an Arctic winter storm event,"We examine an Arctic winter storm event, which led to ice break-up, the formation of open leads, and the subsequent freezing of these leads. The methane (CH4) concentration in under-ice surface water before and during the storm event was 8-12 nmol L-1, which resulted in a potential sea-to-air CH4 flux ranging from +0.2 to +2.1 mg CH4 m- 2 d-1 in open leads. CH4 ventilation between seawater and atmosphere occurred when both open water fraction and wind speed increased. Over the nine days after the storm, sea ice grew 27 cm thick. Initially, CH4 concentrations in the sea ice brine were above the equilibrium with the atmosphere. As the ice grew thicker, most of the CH4 was lost from upper layers of sea ice into the atmosphere, implying continued CH4 evasion after the leads were ice-covered. This suggests that wintertime CH4 emissions need to be better constrained.",Methane; Arctic ocean; Sea ice; Wintertime; Storm,2022,33,NA,10.1016/j.polar.2022.100874,1873-9652,14,82,147,873,5,NA,200,5,No,225,175,no,yes,yes

POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,The effects of feral dogs on wildlife in a nature reserve in southern Turkey,"Feral dogs can negatively impact wildlife through predation, fear interceded behavioural changes, harassment, hybridisation, and disease transmission. Thus, the presence of feral dogs in nature reserves poses a major problem for wildlife conservation. In this study, we recorded the effects of free-roaming dogs (Canis familiaris) on wildlife species in a protected Mediterranean forest reserve in southern Turkey. By using camera traps and line transects we sought to understand how the presence of feral dogs impacted the main wildlife species in the study area. Applying presence-absence transect surveys and camera trapping techniques to estimate animal occurrence we covered approximately 97,00 ha and recorded 4209 images over a 154-week period. We found that the presence of feral dogs was significantly correlated with the movement of frequently observed wildlife species. Based on transect surveys, the species significantly affected by dog presence were fallow deer (Dama dama), wild boar (Sus scrofa), beech marten (Martes foina), badger (Meles meles), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Based on the camera trap data, fallow deer were negatively affected and wild boar not affected by dog occurrence while wild goat (Capra aegagrus) and caracal (Caracal caracal) were positively affected. The occurrence of wild boars, wild goats, hares, beech martens, red foxes and caracals across our study area increased with distance from agricultural land, while the occurrence of deer decreased. Overall, our findings suggest that the presence of dogs has a strong influence on wildlife in our study reserve.

In this field study, the carbon storage in overstory, understory, litter layer of plants and soil carbon in forests was investigated in 26-28 year-old Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) pure and mixed forests along a latitudinal gradient (20-30 degrees N) crossing Hunan and Guangxi provinces of China, during the period of May 2015-August 2017. We found that the total carbon storage in Masson pine forests ranged 88.92-149.41 Mg/ha, of which 54.03\% occurred in aboveground compound and 45.97\% occurred belowground. The overall total carbon storage distribution was 34.62-68.72 Mg/ha, 3.82-10.19 Mg/ha, 2.37-3.96 Mg/ha, and 6.06-12.08 Mg/ha in stems, branches, leaves, and roots, respectively.

The carbon storage increased by 8.43\% in Masson pine mixed forests compared to the pure forest stands after the transformation from the pure forest stands into the mixed forest stands similar to 15 years later. The results of changes in carbon storage in the studied forests with the latitudinal gradient could be attributed to variations in hydrothermal conditions with changing latitudes.

POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Differences in troglomorphism and sexual dimorphism in two sympatric subtroglophile crickets of genus Troglophilus (Insecta: Orthoptera),"We investigated morphological variation and sexual dimorphism in two species of syntopic cave crickets (Troglophilus neglectus and T. cavicola) from Northern Balkans. T. cavicola is able to penetrate deeper in caves and stays there for longer periods than T. neglectus. Yet, it has not exhibited clearly stronger constructive (body size, elongation of appendages, increased spinulation) or reductive (eye reduction) traits than T. neglectus. Moreover, contrary to expectation, there is no clear association between more prolonged staying in a stable cave environment and overall lower morphological variability in T. cavicola. Only some of its morphological traits actually showed less while other showed more variation than in T. neglectus. While T. cavicola males are larger than females, there is no such difference in T. neglectus. This may help males of T. cavicola being more competitive towards overall larger T. neglectus. With the exception of the body size, overall sexual dimorphism was better expressed in larger T. neglectus. The morphospaces occupied by males and females overlap more strongly in T. cavicola than in T. neglectus, indicating that ecological niches of both sexes are better separated in the latter species.","cave cricket; Balkans, morphometrics; body size; appendages, eye reduction; spinulation",2021,69,1,10.3161/15052249PJE2021/69.1.004,1505-2249,16,136,186,1236,5,NA,250,7,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes
POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Distribution and abundance of the glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) in wintering and breeding grounds in Northeast Algeria,"Atmospheric conditions play an important role in structuring avian communities in space and time. Here we assess the role of weather conditions on the distribution and abundance of the enigmatic glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) in Northeast Algeria in both wintering grounds and in breeding areas in a survey spanning from 2011 to 2019. During the study period, cooler years were wetter and warmer years were drier. The wintering population size in the region could be estimated to 200-300 individuals. The number of individuals in wintering grounds increased in recent years in one site (Berrihane), but it did not show a strong association with weather conditions prior to wintering. Four breeding colonies were detected in highly-vegetated ponds with in-water trees where the number of breeding pairs was the highest. Extinction was recorded for two colonies (50\% of colonies) where one permanently disappeared and one exhibited a series of extinctions and recolonizations across years. The estimated colony size was larger at El Dakhla (60-105 pairs) than El Chatt (0-42 pairs), Fezara Lake (25-41 pairs), and Tonga Lake (0-2 pairs). Climate conditions seemed to correlate with the number of pairs in one site (El Chatt) such that warm and dry years were associated with lower number of individuals. We discuss that disturbance and pollution might play a role in colony establishment but the number of pairs is positively related to the extinction of a nearby colony, suggesting that those refuge colonies are crucial for the persistence of the species in the area. This study presents historical data on the occurrence and abundance of a relatively unstudied species and gives new information on its climatic sensitivity which might be helpful for predicting future climate change impacts.",Plegadis falcinellus; distribution; climatic conditions; breeding colonies; foraging areas; North Africa,2021,69,3-Apr,10.3161/15052249PJE2021.69.3.005,1505-2249,17,123,282,1797,6,NA,250,7,Yes,275,225,yes,no,yes
POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,First records of conspecific brood parasitism in two species of small passerines: lesser whitethroat and common linnet,"We provide the first records of possible conspecific brood parasitism in the lesser whitethroat Sylvia curruca and the common linnet Linaria cannabina, two species of small passerines. In 2018 we found two unusually large clutches, one for each species (8 and 9 eggs, respectively), both containing two distinct egg morphs differing in coloration. Further detailed analysis of egg morphology and brood phonology (in the whitethroat) suggested that the eggs in each nest had been laid by different females. Surprisingly, two seemingly full sized clutches were laid in both nests, a pattern that is unusual in conspecific brood parasitism in passerines, whose nests are typically parasitized with single eggs. Alternatives to conspecific brood parasitism are therefore discussed. We argue that traditional field-based methods, when carefully used, may be sufficient to document brood parasitism recorded during occasional observations. We finally conclude that enlarged broods, resulting from conspecific brood parasitism, are probably more frequent than expected, but they may be often overlooked.",enlarged clutch; intraspecific brood parasitism; egg dumping; host-parasite interaction; Sylvia curruca; Linaria cannabina,2021,69,2,10.3161/15052249PJE2021.69.2.005,1505-2249,17,118,159,1096,6,NA,250,7,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes

Here, we examined the abundance and diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods, and soil attributes in burned and unburned grasslands in the semiarid Nanhuashan Natural Reserve in western Loess Plateau of China. Arthropods and soil were sampled in springtime one year after fire disturbance. We found no significant differences in total abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods between burned and unburned grasslands. However, the taxonomic richness and the Shannon index of ground-dwelling arthropods were found to be significantly greater in burned than unburned grasslands. Postfire effects also indicated significant differences in dominance hierarchy among taxa within functional groups as a consequence of increasing predatory abundance but decreasing phytophagous one from unburned to burned grasslands. Likewise, soil bulk density declined, whereas soil C/N increased significantly from unburned to burned grasslands. In conclusion, fire could promote the taxonomic richness and the diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods, thus being indicators of positive effect of fire disturbance on biodiversity conservation of semiarid grassland ecosystems of northwestern China.

To describe the ecology and morphology of the mite species Proctophyllodes megaphyllus, a symbiont of the alpine accentor Prunella collaris, 150 accentors were captured in the West Carpathian Mountains of Slovakia. The mites extracted from the birds were sexed and their specific body structures were measured. In total 2144 individuals of P. megaphyllus were collected from 100 accentors. Male mites collected in autumn, after the bird's postnuptial moult, reached the largest size. At the same time, mite prevalence reached maximum while the mean intensity of infestation was at its lowest. Our results suggest that mites preferred newly coated feathers after a moult and radiated horizontally, infesting birds at shared roosting sites where alpine accentors tend to reoccur.

However, regardless of their small size, they are refuges for natural vegetation and species-rich animal assemblages. They are especially important in areas where the intensification of agricultural activities reduces the ecological quality of the landscape. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of the habitat structure of the FWB buffer zone on macrophyte association diversity in the FWBs (n = 49). As many as 175 species of vascular plants, three stoneworts, and 40 (41-49 according to Chao2 estimator) plant associations were recognized, including 19 of high conservation priority. The occurrence of threatened associations (0-5 per FWB) was not correlated with the number of common (unthreatened) ones. The most important predictors of plant diversity (at the species level and the association level) were the connection of the FWB with a watercourse (positive effect), and the distance from the FWB to the nearest built-up areas (positive effect). The results suggest that even though the high percentage cover of perennial vegetation mitigates the effect of diffused pollutions of agricultural origin on FWB biota, its significance may become low when the distance from a built-up area to FWBs is small.",water bodies; plant associations; agricultural catchments; biodiversity conservation; agricultural landscape,2020,68,4,10.3161/15052249PJE2020.68.4.001,1505-2249,14,91,197,1295,5,NA,250,7,Yes,275,225,no,yes,yes

In recent years an increasing number of studies have focused on the physicochemical limits of life on Earth such as temperature, pressure, drought, salt content, pH, heavy metals, etc. Extreme environmental conditions disrupt the most important interactions that support the function and structure of biomolecules. For this reason, organisms inhabiting extreme habitats have recently become of particularly great interest. Although filamentous fungi are an important part of the polar ecosystem, information about their distribution and diversity, as well as their adaptation mechanisms, is insufficient. In the present study, the fungal strain Penicillium griseofulvum isolated from an Antarctic soil sample was used as a study model. The fungal cellular response against short term exposure to low temperature was observed. Our results clearly showed that short-term low temperature exposure caused oxidative stress in fungal cells and resulted in enhanced level of oxidative damaged proteins, accumulation of reserve carbohydrates and increased activity of the antioxidant enzyme defence. Ultrastructural changes in cell morphology were analysed. Different pattern of cell pathology provoked by the application of two stress temperatures was detected.

The fine earth materials were collected on the surfaces of Skhelda and Garabashi glaciers as well as from zonal soils of Baksan Gorge and were studied in terms of chemical, particle-size, and micromorphological features. Supraglacial sediments are located at the glacial drift area of material and, thus, due to transfer of these sediments to the foothill area, their fine earth material can affect micromorphological and chemical characteristics of adjacent zonal soils. Thin sections of mineral and organo-mineral micromonoliths were analyzed by classic micromorphological methods. Data obtained showed that the weathering rates of cryoconite and soil minerals are different. The cryoconite material on the debris-covered Skhelda Glacier originated from local massive crystalline rocks and moraines, while for Garabashi Glacier the volcanic origin of cryoconite is more typical. Soils of Baksan Gorge are characterized by more developed microfabric and porous media, but their mineralogical composition is essentially inherited from sediments of glacial and periglacial soils.

Across the study area species distribution often overlapped, but the domination patterns mirrored environmental conditions preferred by each species. Both species, however, were able to survive in suboptimal conditions. On a small spatial scale (in one sample) the species were separated, which may suggest an antagonistic relationship between them. The ongoing changes in the environment of Svalbard will likely affect these two species differently. The increasing intrusion of Atlantic waters will probably favor the further expansion of G. oceanicus along the Svalbard coasts. This will be due to the gradual advance of the existing population, as an influx of individuals from the Nordic seas seems unlikely. G. setosus will remain the dominant species in cold-water areas such as the inner fjords and the northeastern coast of Svalbard and may find new suitable habitats in lagoons or estuaries fed by melting glaciers.

POLISH POLAR RESEARCH,Infrasound fluctuations during heavy fog event in the Arctic: A case study,"Extremely dense fog event was studied on the 3rd December 2001, which occurred in the city of Apatity, the Kola Peninsula, northwestern Russia. Fog had low visibility (30-50 m) and lasted 17 h. Variations of atmospheric pressure and electric field before and during the fog event were measured. Multiple Taper Method (MTM) of spectral analysis has revealed pulsations of the atmospheric electric field in the frequency band of 0.007-0.05 Hz with a power-law turbulence spectrum. MTM and wavelet decomposition analysis results indicate the appearance of two types of atmospheric pressure oscillations under the fog conditions: low-frequency variations with periods of internal gravity waves and a substantial increase in pulsation intensity (more than an order of magnitude) in the high frequency (0.03-0.35 Hz) range. These results may help to improve the understanding of the microphysics of fog formation, development, and dissipation. High-frequency pulsations generation of atmospheric pressure under the fog conditions is also of interest because their period is close to the range of infrasonic oscillations, which can have negative consequences for human health.",Arctic; Kola; infrasonic waves; atmospheric electric field oscillations,2021,42,3,10.24425/ppr.2021.137143,0138-0338,12,74,173,1169,4,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Desv. plants collected from natural habitats, plants cultured in vitro, regenerated plants, and plants cultivated in a growth chamber. It was found that the shoots (aerial parts) had higher phenolic and flavonoid contents compared to the roots. The largest amount of these substances was found in wild plants from Great Yalour Island. The content of phenolics and flavonoids in plants cultured in vitro was generally comparable to that in plants collected from natural habitats except for some clones.

Based on the seasonal layers with SD and delta O-18 maxima and minima, it was determined that the snowpit, conducted in the vicinity of the Jang Bogo Station in Antarctica, contained snow deposited over a three-year period (2008-2010). Distinct seasonal variations of stable water isotopes were observed, with a slope of 8.2 from the linear isotopic relationship between oxygen and hydrogen, which indicates that the snow accumulated during three years without a significant post-depositional process.

If a group lives in long-term isolation, the influence of personality traits on interpersonal interaction performance will be even stronger. The current study identified and examined the impact of the personality traits of the personnel living at the Ukrainian Antarctic Akademik Vernadsky station (N = 35) on their interpersonal interactions during long-term Antarctic expeditions. The results show that expeditioners' personality traits significantly determined their interpersonal interactions. However, the influence of personality traits on different areas of interactions can vary significantly among different groups of expeditioners, even sometimes in diametrically opposite directions. The main reason for this is a formed microclimate specific to each group and corresponding group norms for formal and informal relations due to significant differences in personality traits that are characteristic of different groups' participants. We determined that eleven indicators, out of a total of 23 examined personality traits, significantly differed among expeditioners from different groups (different expeditions).

(Orchidaceae), once a common perennial herb, is now designated as endangered throughout most of its distribution due to habitat destruction and fragmentation, and the impacts of horticultural collection. We investigated the genetic characteristics of this species for conservation purposes, using microsatellite markers to examine the genetic diversity and structure of 15 native and 5 ex situ populations in Japan. The results imply that although allelic variation is low in Japanese C. japonicum, sexual reproduction by seed, as well as clonal propagation, may occur in some populations. Both native and ex situ populations were found to be genetically differentiated, indicating that some populations may have experienced recent population declines, genetic fragmentation, or bottlenecks. The degree of genetic drift from the putative ancestral population, inferred through STRUCTURE analysis, was more pronounced in northern populations than in southern populations. Some of the ex situ conserved populations exhibited a low degree of differentiation from ancestral native populations.

POPULATION ECOLOGY,Interspecific competition in perennial sedentary organisms: An individual-based model,"We investigated a mathematical model of the dynamics of the ecological system consisting of two competing perennial species, each of which leads a sedentary life. It is an individual-based model, in which the growth of each individual is described. The rate of this growth is weakened by competition from neighboring individuals. The strength of the competitors' influence depends on their size and distance to them. The conditions, in which the competitive exclusion of one of the competitors and the coexistence of both competitors take place are provided. The influence of the parameters responsible for the strength of competition, the degree of competitive asymmetry, and consideration of the importance of specific elements of the spatial structure of this ecological system on the results of the competition were analyzed. Both species co-exist when they are equal competitors. Permanent coexistence is possible only when interspecific competition is weaker than intraspecific. When interspecific competition is stronger, the coexistence of equal interspecific competitors is random. Both species have equal probability of extinction. If species are not equal competitors, the stronger one wins. This result can be modified by different strengths of intraspecific competition. The weaker interspecific competitor can permanently coexist with stronger one, when its individuals suffer stronger intraspecific competition.",competitive exclusion; individual-based model; interspecific competition; sedentary organisms; species coexistence,2023,65,1,10.1002/1438-390X.12136,1438-3896,9,85,205,1426,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

In sika deer, the genetic structure of the maternal lineage has been clarified by studies based on mitochondrial DNA variation. However, the genetic structure of the paternal lineage has not been well analyzed due to the limited number of point mutations in Y chromosome sequences. In this study, we focused on mutations of highly polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in the Y chromosome and developed 16 Y chromosome SSR markers to evaluate male-biased dispersal in sika deer. In total, 55 alleles and 31 multi-locus haplotypes were detected from these 16 loci, revealing clear genetic differentiation among populations (F `(ST) = 0.783). In particular, there were unique alleles for the native individuals on Tanegashima and Yakushima Islands and introduced exotic individuals from Taiwan.

Constructing artificial reservoirs can change freshwater biodiversity, thereby impacting genetic diversity (GD), which is crucial to population-level adaptation. The Maipo River basin, inhabited by the endemic silverside Basilichthys microlepidotus, is one of Chile's most impacted freshwater systems. In this basin, the species is divided into five populations. Recently, a new population was discovered in the reservoir Laguna Esmeralda (LE). We hypothesized that LE silversides possess less GD than other populations and originated from a single basin population. Our evidence shows that the LE is a genetically isolated population with evidence of low genetic variation, but not showing signals of bottleneck or significant reduction in GD. Results consistently identified two sites as unlikely to be the origin of the LE silverside population, suggesting that it was established by the immigration of many individuals from the other three populations.",Basilichthys microlepidotus; genetic differentiation; genetic diversity; origin population; reservoir,2022,64,3,10.1002/1438-390X.12118,1438-3896,19,137,147,1027,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
POPULATION ECOLOGY,Incorporating diapause to predict the interannual dynamics of an important agricultural pest,"We develop a new population-scale model incorporating diapause induction and termination that allows multi-year predictions of pest dynamics. In addition to predicting phenology and voltinism, the model also allows us to study the degree of overlapping among the life-stages across time; a quantity not generally predicted by previous models yet a key determinant of how frequently management must be done to maintain control. The model is a physiological, stage-structured population model that includes temperature-dependent vital rates, diapause processes, and plasticity in development. The model is statistically fitted with a 33-year long weekly term time series of Cydia pomonella adults captured in pheromone-baited traps from a research orchard in southern Pennsylvania. The multiannual model allows investigation of both within season control strategies, as well as the likely consequences of climate change for this important agricultural pest. The model predicts that warming temperatures will cause earlier spring emergence, additional generations, and increased overall abundance. Most importantly, by calculating the circular variance, we find that warmer temperatures are associated with an increase in overlap among life-stages especially at the beginning of the growing season. Our findings highlight the importance of modeling diapause to fully understand C. pomonella lifecycle and to better inform management for effectively controlling this pest in a warmer future.",developmental synchrony; diapause; distributed-delay models; phenology; temperature dependence,2022,64,3,10.1002/1438-390X.12117,1438-3896,12,92,209,1487,5,NA,250,5,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Populations of a harmless sea snake species (Emydocephalus annulatus) in New Caledonia exhibit colour polymorphism, with around 20\% of individuals banded rather than melanic. Stability in that proportion over 20 years has been attributed to Batesian mimicry of deadly snake species by banded morphs of the harmless taxon. This hypothesis requires that banded colours reduce a snake's vulnerability to predation. We tested that idea by pulling flexible snake-shaped models through the water and recording responses by predatory fish. Black and banded lures attracted similar numbers of following fish, but attacks were directed almost exclusively to black lures.

Here, we test between two key factors that potentially influence ecological severity: biosphere entropy (a measure of functional redundancy), and the degree of functional selectivity (in terms of deviation from a pattern of random extinction with respect to functional entities). While theoretical simulations suggest that the Shannon entropy of a given community prior to an extinction event determines the expected outcome following a perturbation of a given magnitude, actual variation in Shannon entropy between major extinction intervals is insufficient to explain the observed variation in ecological severity. Within this information-theoretic framework, we show that it is the degree of functional selectivity that is expected to primarily determine the ecological impact of a given perturbation when levels of functional redundancy are not substantially different.",mass extinctions; Ordovician; Permian; extinction severity; ecological severity; functional redundancy,2022,289,1979,10.1098/rspb.2022.0440,0962-8452,12,88,152,1077,6,NA,200,6,No,225,175,no,yes,yes

We consider the evolution of ability when individuals interact pairwise over their contribution to a common good. In this interaction, the contribution of each is assumed to be the best given their own ability and the contribution of their partner. Since there is a tendency for individuals to partially compensate for a low contribution by their partner, low-ability individuals can do well. As a consequence, for benefit and cost structures for which individuals have a strong response to partner's contribution, there can be selection for reduced ability.

RANGELAND ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,Effects of Aboveground Community Structure and Belowground Root Morphological Characteristics on Nitrogen Use Efficiency of Mixed-Perennial Legume-Grass Pastures,"Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in plants is dependent on various factors including nitrogen availability and root morphology. This study investigated changes in root morphological and growth features in response to plant community structures in legume-grass mixed pastures. Three types of legume forage and three gramineous forage were selected, including Bromus. innermis, Onobrychis. viciaefolia, Phleum pretense, Trifolium. pretense, Dactylis glomerata, and Medicago sativa. The effects of different community structures on changes in the land equivalent ratio, crowding, aggressivity, and competition, as well as the NUE, N yield, and root morphologies, were investigated. It was found that mixed seeding combinations increased the forage yield significantly but increasing the number of mixed seeding species did not further affect the herbage yield. Both the root lengths and root specific areas of the forage grass increased with increasing spatial distance, indicating that while the root morphology of the grass was controlled by genetic factors, the phenotypic characteristics of forage grass were changed by the balance between aboveground and underground growth. Root morphology was found to play a significant role in the NUE and the relation between specific root area of legume and LN(W-N), specific root length of grass, and LN (W-Nt) can be expressed by the binomial function model.

We used spatial locations of domestic range sheep (Ovis aries) obtained from Global Positioning System collars to study habitat selection on summer mountain habitat North of Scofield Reservoir Utah, United States. Data were collected between the months of July to September 2020. We developed a resource selection function to determine the influence of slope, distance to water, aspect, ruggedness, elevation, and vegetation types on habitat selection by sheep while grazing on summer mountain habitat. We found sheep selected for sites closer to water, with more gentle terrain, higher in elevation, and north-facing slopes. Vegetation types were less predictive, ostensibly due to the lack of species composition information in available geographic information system layers and the possibility of sheep being herded to avoid areas of overuse. Although it is often assumed that sheep use slopes more than their heavier and larger cattle counterparts, overall they tended to avoid steep slopes compared with all other predictor variables. This information on selection for higher elevations and avoidance of steep slopes can be used to improve livestock management practices including flock management that increases sheep foraging patterns and energy efficiency.

In this experiment, we measured germination and emergence of 4 fall-seeded perennial grasses at 15 sites in southeastern Oregon, north-central Nevada, and southwestern Idaho in 2 different yr. We used hydrothermal germination and seedbed microclimatic models to estimate planting date effects on germination and preemergence mortality and evaluated these simulations relative to measured germination and seedling emergence in the field. There were clear indications that both germination and emergence were responsive to site-year effects, but premature fall germination before winter freezing events was not a factor in emergence rates. In all cases, planting was sufficiently late in the fall to avoid significant postgermination/preemergence freezing injury for the sites and years tested. Emergence was weakly correlated to seedbed favorability in the late winter and spring after the principal period of soil freezing. Our data show that for the 2 yr of this study, we can only account for a relatively small portion of any abiotic effects on spring emergence. General inferences about planting date effects, however, may have been limited by arid conditions during the 2-yr field study relative to long-term climate normals.

RANGELAND ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,Estimating Reduction in Standing Crop Biomass from California Ground Squirrels in Central California Rangelands,"California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus spp.) cause more economic damage to California rangelands than any other rodent. Damage comes in many forms, although forage loss is typically the greatest concern. These losses are believed to be significant for ranchers, particularly given the economically marginal environment in which they exist, yet our understanding of these economic losses is limited. Furthermore, current public opinion is often not supportive toward ground squirrel control on many public grazing lands. Information on the damage that ground squirrels cause to rangelands may be needed to justify management actions in the future. Therefore, we evaluated the amount of standing crop removed by California ground squirrels across 16 sites at four different ground squirrel density categories in central California rangelands from 2019 through 2020. We also included precipitation and livestock grazing intensity to help account for their potential effect on forage production. We found that ground squirrel abundance negatively affected standing crop biomass, with available forage reduced by 27.2 kg ha(-1) per individual ground squirrel at the end of the growing season. Likewise, precipitation influenced standing crop, with each cm of precipitation yielding a 16.6 kg ha(-1) increase in available forage. We did not observe any effect of livestock grazing intensity, an interaction between livestock grazing intensity and ground squirrel abundance, or an interaction between precipitation and ground squirrel abundance on residual standing crop. Collectively, this information will be useful to ranchers to help determine when control efforts may be needed for California ground squirrels given relative abundance of ground squirrels on their rangeland properties.

We quantified patterns of seedling emergence from samples of litter, thatch, and mineral soil collected from invaded grassland sites, hypothesizing that POPR would be the dominant emergent species, but that composition of seedling populations would differ between the layers with a higher incidence of native species in mineral soil. POPR accounted for 84\% of the emergent seedlings, and curves, fit with a Hill model, indicated that 50\% of cumulative emergence was reached after 40.5 d. Rank-abundance diagrams were highly skewed and strongly dominated by POPR but indicated differences among litter, thatch, and soil layers. POPR accounted for 94.3\%, 71.9\%, and 69.9\% of emergent seedlings from litter, thatch, and soil layers, respectively. More POPR seedlings emerged from litter material than the other layers.

RANGELAND ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,Low Neighbor Abundances Are Often Necessary but Insufficient for Establishing Seeded Shrubs,"Shrubs seeded during rangeland restoration often fail to adequately establish. One factor differentiating successful and unsuccessful shrub seeding efforts is competition from grasses seeded with shrubs and weeds. Despite efforts to control these neighbors in experiments, their abundances often remained high, which suggests neighbors may have limited shrubs in much previous research. In the northern Great Plains, I evaluated seeded shrub survival and growth across a grass and weed biomass gradient. The treatment that held neighbor cover lowest provided the greatest shrub density and size, but density was low even in this treatment. Nevertheless, the data support previous studies indicating controlling neighbors can greatly benefit shrubs. Constraining neighbors increased shrub density similar to 25 x(from about 0.005 to 0.13 m(-2)). This large proportional effect could make the difference between shrub restoration success and failure when greater emergence occurs due to factors unrelated to competition, such as shrub seed rate and environmental conditions. Controlling neighbors is often necessary to establish shrubs, but currently, shrubs can fail to establish even where neighbors are well controlled. Additional research is needed to overcome barriers to establishment unrelated to competition.

RANGELAND ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,Evaluation of the APEX cattle weight gain component for grazing decision-support in the Western Great Plains,"Rotational grazing studies have produced mixed results related to animal performance (weight gain), which has contributed to producer uncertainty regarding grazing management decisions. To enhance decision-support for producers, we improved algorithms in the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model to better represent cattle weight gain in real-world rangeland conditions under two grazing management strategies. Simulated weight gain and related forage effects were evaluated with experimental data from 2014 to 2018 under two grazing strategies. The traditional rangeland management strategy used continuous season-long grazing stocked at a moderate level. The collaborative adaptive rangeland management strategy employed grazing with one large herd rotated using a sequence developed by a stakeholder group with movement between pastures driven by predetermined decision triggers. For each grazing strategy, yearling steers grazed from mid-May to October on ten 130-ha pastures. With the APEX modifications, daily weight gain was adequately simulated for both continuous (traditional rangeland management) grazing and management intensive rotational (collaborative adaptive rangeland management) grazing. Dry matter intake, total digestible nutrients, and temporal distribution of dry matter intake were the primary influencers of cattle performance (weight gain).

RANGELAND JOURNAL,Breaking the wildfire cycle: progressive fire management can shift fire regimes and improve ecosystem condition. A case study from a large conservation reserve in northern Australia,"Extensive late dry season fires in northern Australia have long been considered detrimental to biodiversity conservation, pastoral production and other cultural and landscape values. Fire management programs in these landscapes typically aim to shift the fire regime from wildfires occurring predominately in the late dry season (LDS), when they tend to be extensive and destructive, to prescribed burns in the early dry season (EDS), when fires are generally smaller and less intensive. The intent is to create heterogeneity in vegetation age classes, reduce the scale of LDS fires and, in doing so, retain long-unburnt vegetation, a critical asset for biodiversity in a flammable landscape. Boodjamulla National Park, in Queensland's Gulf Country, experienced a cycle of large LDS wildfires every 5 years for most of its history as a pastoral property and park until a progressive EDS burning program was introduced. Although there is limited information for defining the ideal fire regime for spinifex (Triodia spp.) rangelands, this program has improved a range of spatial metrics which the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) believes can only benefit biodiversity; these include decreased annual and LDS area burnt; a greater number of small burnt patches; shorter distances between recently burnt and long-unburnt spinifex; and, consequently, a greater area of long-unburnt spinifex embedded in the mosaic across the landscape. There has been an improvement in the ecological parameters of these landscapes, as well as the protection and persistence of fire-sensitive vegetation communities and species, because of the burn program.",fire management; heterogeneity; prescribed burning; spatial metrics; spinifex,2023,44,"6, SI",10.1071/RJ22021,1036-9872,26,181,246,1648,5,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,Fortifying the financial and environmental capital banks in commercially grazed rangelands,"Commercial rangeland livestock producers manage a perpetual conflict. They must ensure that the financial and environmental elements of rangeland grazing remain concurrently robust, with neither borrowing excessively from the other. Successfully managing this financial and environmental tension requires sound financial literacy as it applies to pastoralism, an above-average knowledge of rangeland ecology, and intellectual and practical management skills. Achieving these competencies is the starting point for a truly sustainable rangeland grazing business. The degree to which these competencies are achieved is largely under the control of the people who manage the business. However, there are significant external influences that can impede progress towards better financial and environmental outcomes. In this paper, we draw upon more than 50 years of combined professional experience to present our definitions for financial and environmental sustainability, as they pertain to northern Australian grazing enterprises. We summarise what is currently known about the financial and environmental performance of the northern Australian beef industry, and highlight some of the current external factors that are potentially antagonistic to achieving sustainable livestock production. We conclude with a protocol that our most successful clients have used to achieve (and demonstrate) financial and environmental sustainability.",Australia; business management; environmental management; grazing; land management; livestock; rangelands; sustainability,2023,44,"6, SI",10.1071/RJ22030,1036-9872,11,90,194,1433,8,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,Social-identity dynamics in rural communities: a motive for resistance to change,"This research found that rural social resistance to change and newcomers can be explained in part by the influence of social-set membership. Eighty-nine interviews were conducted in two Australian inland rural communities with population <2000 and analysed with a recognised cultural dynamics framework. This found attachment to local social identity, social hierarchy and cultural norms that represented social power. Established residents defended the status quo when valued facets of social identity were perceived to be threatened, resisting efforts to introduce change. Persons representing a challenge to established local identity norms could be socially undermined and censured to preserve the power of dominant social sets, defending their preferred narratives and norms. Understanding social identity influences can explain rural communities' tendency to conservatism, why newcomers and new ideas are often derided, ignored or attacked. It can explain the motives for negative social capital and suggests social identity as a factor in small town newcomer business failure, and resistance to new knowledge transfer and practice adoption. Welcome and induction to local social codes is critical to newcomer integration. Outsiders and newcomers may meet discretely with like-minded or similar persons to safely fulfil social needs or influence as a social minority, providing support to their own unique group. Where residents cannot find inclusion, they may disengage.

RANGELAND JOURNAL,An objective prioritisation method for agriculture RD\&E,"We aimed to develop and test a relatively objective method for rapidly and accurately assessing the priority for research of interventions tendered as potential solutions to a prevailing problem in agriculture. In this test, our method aimed to direct research of evidenced-based strategies to ameliorate consistently high rates of foetal and calf loss experienced in northern Australia's beef herd. Detailed reviews of factors affecting foetal and calf loss and potential solutions were conducted. A simple economic analysis, based on rating management interventions for their impact on earnings before interest and tax, was then developed to enable rapid simultaneous business-impact comparison of multiple options. If the outcome value for an option is negative, it suggests that the option is less profitable than is prevailing practice, if approximately zero, it suggests that the option is very marginal, and more positive values suggest a higher potential benefit. The values obtained were further analysed by rating for incidence and researchability to derive research priority. This sequence of activities was conducted by peers representing a broad spectrum of beef business (managing an estimated 0.4 million cattle), science and agribusiness representatives from across northern Australia. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the method was robust in ranking both business impact and research priority. Ten foetal and calf-loss minimisation interventions were rated by producer and agribusiness representatives and the project team as a high priority for business. Four of these were excluded because of low incidence or low researchability, leaving six rated as having highest priority for research. Informal feedback from many participants indicated high satisfaction with the proposed method. The conclusion was that this method, with suggested variations, successfully discriminated priority for a large range of potential interventions for calf loss research, development and extension (RD\&E). The method described could readily supplant commonly used more subjective methods and be used to assess priority for RD\&E of other issues for multiple agricultural commodities, as well as simply for rapid assessment of management options within a production enterprise.",beef cattle; calf loss; economics; northern Australia; priorities; research; management; objective,2022,44,3,10.1071/RJ22009,1036-9872,7,56,329,2287,8,8,300,8,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,Can dingoes increase graziers' profits and help maintain Australia's rangelands?,"Australia's largest land carnivore, the dingo, has been targeted by control programs in many agricultural landscapes since European settlement because of the judgement that dingoes cause costs to producers through the killing of livestock. As Australian pastoralists, we challenge the assumption that dingoes will only cause costs to producers. Based on our personal experiences and from research, we provide an alternative view, namely that in certain circumstances, there are major economic and ecological benefits of maintaining dingoes in grazing landscapes by controlling the unmanaged grazing pressure. As cattle producers, we have obtained significant financial gains for our family businesses, and environmental benefits on our properties by maintaining dingoes. Dingoes greatly reduce high-density populations of larger kangaroo species and some feral animals, especially goats. Such unmanaged grazing is persistently identified as a major factor in landscape degradation across large areas of Australian rangelands. The Australian pastoral industry as a whole, and the government departments that support it, need to evaluate, consider and discuss the economic and ecological benefits as well as the costs of maintaining dingoes in Australian pastoral landscapes.",commercial beef cattle enterprises; dingo ecology; dingoes; ecological benefits; economic benefits; feral goats; grazing pressure; herbivores; kangaroos; land management; over-grazing; pastoral enterprises; profits; profitability; rangeland management,2022,44,3,10.1071/RJ22002,1036-9872,10,80,179,1273,15,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,"Diet quality, liveweight change and responses to N supplements by cattle grazing Astrebla spp. (Mitchell grass) pastures in the semi-arid tropics in north-western Queensland, Australia","Experiments during 4 years examined the diets selected, growth, and responses to N supplements by Bos indicus-cross steers grazing summer-rainfall semi-arid C4 Astrebla spp. (Mitchell grass) rangelands at a site in north-western Queensland, Australia. Paddock groups of steers were not supplemented (T-NIL), or were fed a non-protein N (T-NPN) or a cottonseed meal (T-CSM) supplement. In Experiment 1, young and older steers were measured during the late dry season (LDS) and the rainy season (RS), while steers in Experiments 2-4 were measured through the annual cycle. Because of severe drought the measurements during Experiment 3 annual cycle were limited to T-NIL steers. Pasture availability and species composition were measured twice annually. Diet was measured at 1-2 week intervals using near infrared spectroscopy of faeces (F.NIRS). Annual rainfalls (1 July-30 June) were 42-68\% of the long-term average (471 mm), and the seasonal break ranged from 17 December to 3 March. There was wide variation in pasture, diet (crude protein (CP), DM digestibility (DMD), the CP to metabolisable energy (CP/ME) ratio) and steer liveweight change (LWC) within and between annual cycles. High diet quality and steer liveweight (LW) gain during the RS declined progressively through the transition season (TS) and early dry season (EDS), and often the first part of the LDS. Steers commenced losing LW as the LDS progressed. In Experiments 1 and 2 where forbs comprised <= 15 g/kg of the pasture sward, steers selected strongly for forbs so that they comprised 117-236 g/kg of the diet. However, in Experiments 3 and 4 where forbs comprised substantial proportions of the pasture (173-397 g/kg), there were comparable proportions in the diet (300-396 g/kg). With appropriate stocking rates the annual steer LW gains were acceptable (121-220 kg) despite the low rainfall. The N supplements had no effect on steer LW during the TS and the EDS, but usually reduced steer LW loss by 20-30 kg during the LDS. Thus during low rainfall years in Mitchell grass pastures there were substantial LW responses by steers to N supplements towards the end of the dry season when the diet contained c. c. <7.0 g CP/MJ ME.",dietary protein; digestibility; faeces; forbs; grazing; near infrared spectroscopy; protein supplements; rangelands; steers,2022,44,2,10.1071/RJ21056,1036-9872,25,184,352,2203,9,8,300,8,No,325,275,yes,no,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,Environmental drivers of above-ground biomass in semi-arid rangelands,"Above-ground biomass (AGB), as a key biophysical and functional parameter of rangeland ecosystems, plays an important role in ecosystem carbon (C) stocks. The aim of this study was to explore the important environmental drivers of AGB in an arid rangeland by using structural equation modelling (SEM). Vegetation and soil (physical and chemical properties) were sampled using randomised-systematic methods within sampling plots. The topographic (elevation, slope, aspect, hillshade (i.e. a technique for showing the topographical shape of hills and mountains to indicate relative slopes and mountain ridges)) and climatic (mean temperature (MT), mean precipitation (MP), actual evapo-transpiration (AET) and land-surface temperature (LST)) properties were extrapolated using a raster-based digital elevation-model (DEM) map, and their values extracted at each sampling plot. SEM was then applied to assess the direct and indirect impacts of environmental factors on AGB. The AGB was directly affected by soil (41\%, P< 0.05) and climatic properties (34\%, P< 0.05). The effect of topographical factors on AGB was non-significant (P> 0.05). However, climatic properties were directly affected by topographical properties, with a path coefficient of 34\%. Among soil properties, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations, silt content and soil pH were the key factors affecting AGB. Climatic variables (MT, MP) were equally effective in explaining the climate latent variable (with loading factors of -0.97 and 0.99 respectively) and AGB changes. This study highlighted the importance of soil and climatic properties in AGB variation.

RANGELAND JOURNAL,"Interactions among climate, topography, soil structure and rangeland aboveground net primary production","Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) of rangeland ecosystems is driven by interactions among multiple environmental factors. This study aimed to model the combined effects of precipitation, elevation, and soil conditions on ANPP variation along an elevation gradient. Ground surveys and vegetation sampling were conducted in 2016 through 26 sampling sites along two elevation profiles in the rangelands of Moghan-Sabalan, Ardabil Province, Iran. At each sampling site, the ANPP of each plant functional type (PFT; grasses, forbs, and shrubs) was measured, and soil samples were taken from 0-15 to 15-30 cm depth. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to investigate the factors affecting both total and PFT ANPP. Soil variables were the best predictors of grass (R-2 = 0.51), forb (R-2 = 0.61), shrub (R-2 = 0.71), and total (R-2 = 0.76) ANPP. The SEM interpretation suggested that precipitation is the most important direct driver of ANPP with R-2 values of 0.20 (Total), 0.30 (Shrubs), 0.26 (Grasses), and 0.10 (Forbs). Whereas soil factors were good predictors in the regression models, the SEM models demonstrated that soil factors were generally unimportant compared with climate, likely owing to the close links between soil-forming factors and climate. The results make it possible to estimate annual ANPP combined with climate forecasts and leads to more accurate estimates of future grazing capacity by policy makers and stakeholders.",Ardabil province; elevation gradient; environmental factors; Forbs; Grasses; plant functional types; primary productivity; Shrubs; structural equation modeling,2022,44,3,10.1071/RJ21013,1036-9872,12,103,224,1479,9,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Our objective was to use the farm-management economics framework to assess the ability of management strategies and investment options to improve profitability and build the overall resilience of beef cattle properties in the mulga lands. Options were assessed for a hypothetical, representative beef cattle property in south-western Queensland (20 000 ha; initial stocking rate 600 adult equivalents). Firstly, strategies were assessed for their ability to improve profitability when operated as a beef business. Secondly, two alternative investment options were assessed: (1) conversion to rangeland meat goat production; and (2) conversion to carbon farming through carbon sequestration. Herd and economic modelling software were used to conduct property-level, partial discounted cash-flow budgets to assess each strategy over a 30-year investment period. Results indicated very limited potential to improve the profitability and resilience of an existing beef cattle enterprise in the mulga lands. However, full or partial conversion to rangeland meat goat production or carbon farming improved property-level returns and viability.",carbon farming; decision making; drought management; extensive grazing systems; farm-management economics; goats; modelling; profitability; rangeland management; rangelands; technology adoption,2022,44,2,10.1071/RJ21057,1036-9872,16,117,193,1402,11,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,Predicted effects of simulated ambient warming and moisture on forage nutrient quality and community composition in Mongolian an arid grassland,"Sustainable forage and livestock production in grazed grasslands are threatened by global climatic change. In this study, we examined how forage quality at the species and community levels in Mongolian drylands might be affected by warming and additional moisture. Four different treatments, a control, open-top chambers (OTCs) only, OTCs with heaters, and OTCs with additional watering, were set up in the field, and air and soil temperature and soil moisture were monitored. A vegetation survey was conducted and plants were harvested during summer, 1 and 2 years after experimental treatments were established. The harvested plant samples were separated into a dominant species (Stipa) or `other species', and analysed to determine acid detergent fibre (ADF) and in vitro dry-matter digestibility (IVDMD). ADF was measured with the detergent method and the digestibility with the pepsin-cellulase assay. Overall, the warming treatments alone (OTC and OTC with heater) increased ADF 10\% and 5\% more than did the control at the species and community levels respectively, and decreased digestibility 12\% and 11\% below the control at the community level. Changes in plant nutritional value may have occurred as a result of changes in plant structure for some or all the plant species monitored, and an indirect effect of the shift in botanical species composition owing to warming. Unlike moist grassland, grass nutrition in arid grasslands was sensitive to treatments associated with the predicted effects of global warming as the results of changes in plant nutrition. It is therefore highly possible that Mongolian livestock production will be negatively affected as a result of ongoing global warming.",ADF; arid land; botanical composition; digestibility; heater; NMDS; OTC; S. krylovii,2022,44,3,10.1071/RJ22027,1036-9872,20,143,260,1708,8,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,Responses of grass productivity traits to bush clearing in semi-arid rangelands in North-West Province of South Africa,"Woody plant encroachment threatens herbaceous plant productivity in many rangelands globally. We evaluated the impact of bush clearing on grass tiller, leaf and biomass production, and tuft sizes in the Kgomo-kgomo and Makapaanstad rangelands in North-West Province, South Africa. In each rangeland, the number of tillers and leaves, tuft sizes and biomass of eight dominant grass species were recorded in bush-cleared and uncleared treatments. The treatment and species interacted significantly (P < 0.001) for tiller and leaf production and tuft sizes. Bush clearing increased tiller production of bunch grasses but not stoloniferous grasses. At Kgomo-kgomo, bunch grasses (Panicum maximum (Jacq.) and Urochloa mosambicensis (Hack.) Dandy] had three to six times more tillers and leaves per plant in the cleared than uncleared treatment. At Makapaanstad, only annual bunch grasses {[}Brachiaria eruciformis (Sibth. \& Sm.)

RANGELAND JOURNAL,"Some soil factors constraining buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) seedling growth rate across a range of acid red Kandosols in Queensland, Australia","Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) has passionate grazing industry advocates and biodiversity conservation detractors around the world due to its ability to readily establish and spread on certain soil types. A more detailed understanding of what soil factors influence the success of seedling establishment will offer guidance to anyone wishing to either encourage or discourage buffel grass establishment in a particular area. Twenty soils from land types where buffel grass had a varied history of successful establishment and persistence in south western Queensland, Australia were assessed in a pot trial for their influence on early seedling growth rate of buffel grass. Some currently had buffel grass growing there. Aspects of the chemistry of each soil were compared against the rate of seedling growth of buffel grass cv. Biloela that was sown with or without a phosphate coating on the seed. Available soil phosphorus had a major influence on seedling growth in the absence of a phosphate fertiliser coating, but levels of other factors such as exchangeable aluminium and calcium were also critical. Several multiple regression equations with differing soil parameters included proved equally good at predicting buffel seedling growth but they did not greatly improve on the strong correlation with available soil phosphorus. This seemed due to the interchangeability amongst soil pH, cation exchange capacity and degree of clay as controlling factors, over and above available phosphorus. Thus, where available soil phosphorus is marginal for rapid buffel seedling growth, soil pH, exchangeable aluminium and total exchangeable cation levels could have similar importance in determining whether buffel grass colonised or failed to gain a foothold in that area.",aluminium saturation; aluminium toxicity; clay content; exchangeable acidity; exchangeable calcium; pH; phosphorus; red earth,2022,44,2,10.1071/RJ21062,1036-9872,22,149,267,1773,8,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,Stocking density and distribution in relation to vegetation in a biodiverse semi-arid pastoral system in South Africa,"The spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in a communal grazing system provides pastoralists with a range of grazing sites to select for their livestock. When fencing spatially constrains herds, there is reduced access to ecological heterogeneity, which may have a negative impact on livestock and the grazing resource. This study investigated temporal and spatial changes in stocking densities and distribution within the six major vegetation types of the Leliefontein pastoral area in Namaqualand, South Africa. This semi-arid, biodiverse area of about 2000 km(2) supports a spatially-constrained mobile pastoral system based on small stock production. Over the data period from 1999 to 2006, the location of 256 small stock herds, their temporal occupancy and herd size were used to determine stocking densities within the daily grazing radius of herds. These grazing radii were overlaid using GIS to produce stocking density distributions over the landscape. The density and location of herds were unevenly distributed when assessed monthly and annually. Parts of the study area were consistently overstocked whereas others remained ungrazed. We argue that the recommendation of fixed stocking rates within this variable environment is inappropriate because forage availability and quality fluctuate within and between years and within drought cycles. We conclude that development interventions should rather focus on reducing stocking densities during and after drought periods. This would benefit pastoralists through reduced livestock mortalities and the vegetation would recover more quickly from the impacts of drought.",drought; grazing management; landscape ecology; livestock mobility; Namaqualand; overstocking; semiarid shrublands; spatial variation; stocking rate; Succulent Karoo,2022,44,1,10.1071/RJ21046,1036-9872,17,117,234,1626,10,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of understorey biomass in semi-arid woodlands of south-eastern Australia,"When managing grazing pressure for conservation, understanding forage dynamics is essential. In south-eastern Australia, ongoing grazing is inhibiting regeneration in several semi-arid woodland communities. Western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus (Desmarest, 1817)) have been identified as a key component of total grazing pressure. They are thought to switch from grass to lower-quality browse, including tree seedlings, when grass biomass falls below 400 kg ha(-1). One static threshold may not adequately capture the spatial and temporal hazard associated with kangaroo grazing, and this study aimed to explore how grassy biomass varies across a case-study landscape. Understorey biomass and species composition data were collected in the field on seven occasions between December 2016 and May 2019. We used Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to describe the influence of environmental and herbivory variables on total (live and dead) understorey, live understorey, and grass (live and dead) biomass. Canopy cover showed the strongest influence on understorey biomass, with more biomass found in open sites than in woodland. Understorey biomass levels were lowest in summer and autumn. Grass biomass, in particular, fell below the 400 kg ha(-1) forage-switch threshold in wooded areas during this time. We anticipate that an increased understanding of understorey biomass dynamics will inform managers as to when and where to focus management efforts to promote regeneration and sustained recovery of these semi-arid woodlands. Results of this study suggest that conducting management efforts before the summer/autumn decline in understorey biomass, particularly in woodlands, is critical in reducing the browsing risk to seedlings.",grazing management; grazing pressure; herbage mass; herbivory by kangaroos; regeneration; semiarid rangelands,2022,44,1,10.1071/RJ21060,1036-9872,13,114,249,1745,6,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,Weak negative responses of spider diversity to short-term `kraaling',"The influence of short-duration, concentrated kraaling (enclosure) has been documented for plants, wildlife, and macro-invertebrates. However, limited information is available on its impact on ground-dwelling spiders. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of short-duration kraaling, time since cattle removal, and microhabitat variables on spider assemblages in Matabeleland North Province, Zimbabwe. We used a matched-pair and space for time design (inside vs outside previously kraaled inclusions) across 11 sites, using four cattle herds (H-1, H-6, H-7 and H-Nguni). Spiders were sampled in the early and late rainy season with pitfall traps left open for 14-day sampling periods and emptied twice in each period. We captured 634 spiders, comprising 63 species in 44 genera and 18 families. The most abundant family was Lycosidae (37\%; 16 spp.), followed by Gnaphosidae (15\%; 10 spp.) and Salticidae (14.5\%; 7 spp.). Generalised linear mixed models showed that generic richness was greater in sites with more bare ground. However, this effect was reversed in previously kraaled sites, and was particularly evident for spider abundance that responded negatively relative to unkraaled sites. Furthermore, with a U-shaped recovery, generic richness increased with time since kraaling. Model-based multivariate models showed that short-duration kraaling had a significant impact on spider assemblage structure, but this impact was relatively small compared with the effect of seasonality. Most of the species that made significant contributions to this multivariate response were less abundant in kraaled sites. Spider diversity, therefore, had a weak negative response to short-term kraaling. However, these impacts should also be assessed at broader scales, including areas where cattle go to graze during the day.",Araneae; cattle; ground dwelling spiders; holistic planned grazing; rangeland; savanna; vegetation; Zimbabwe,2022,44,2,10.1071/RJ22004,1036-9872,9,68,266,1832,8,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,A production-scale evaluation of nutritional monitoring and decision support software for free-ranging cattle in an arid environment,"Range cattle in semi-arid regions are commonly limited by lack of nitrogen and other nutrients from grazing low-quality forage, with managers needing to monitor diet quality to address nutrient limitations. Near-infrared spectroscopy of faecal samples (FNIRS) is an accurate method used to determine diet quality in grazing animals. When combined with a nutritional balance software such as the Nutritional Balance Analyser (NUTBAL), FNIRS can monitor nutritional status and estimate weight change. We aimed to test the ability of NUTBAL to predict animal performance as represented by body condition score (BCS) in cattle grazing on a semi-desert rangeland. BCS and faecal samples were collected from a Red Angus herd (n = 82) at the Santa Rita Ranch (June 2016-July 2017). Standing biomass and botanical composition were measured before each grazing period, and relative utilisation was measured following each grazing period. During the midpoint of grazing in each pasture, 30 BCS and a faecal composite of 15 samples were collected. Faecal derived diet quality varied between a maximum of 10.75\% crude protein (CP) and 61.25\% digestible organic matter (DOM) in early August 2016, to a minimum value of 4.22\% CP and 57.68\% DOM in January 2017. Three NUTBAL evaluations were conducted to determine the likelihood of accurately predicting animal performance: one with typical user defined inputs; one with improved environment and herd descriptive inputs; and one with these improvements plus the use of metabolisable protein in the model. This third evaluation confirmed the ability of FNIRS:NUTBAL to predict future BCS within 0.5 BCS more than 75\% of the time. With this information, cattle managers in semi-arid regions can better address animal performance needs and nutrient deficiencies.",cattle; grazing; arid environment; nutritional monitoring; prediction software; diet management,2021,43,1,10.1071/RJ20116,1036-9872,17,132,274,1800,6,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
RANGELAND JOURNAL,An online system for calculating and delivering long-term carrying capacity information for Queensland grazing properties. Part 2: modelling and outputs,"A combination of field data and models have been used to estimate long-term carrying capacity (LTCC) of domestic livestock in Queensland grazing lands. These methods have been synthesised and coupled with recent developments in science and information technology to provide a fully-automated approach of modelling LTCC through the FORAGE online system. In this study, the GRASP model was used to simulate pasture growth with parameter sets and safe pasture utilisation rates defined for 225 land types across Queensland. Distance to water points was used to assess the accessibility of pastures to livestock. Spatial analysis classified the property into unique areas based on paddock, land type and distance to water points, which estimated pasture growth, pasture utilisation and accessibility at a sub-paddock scale. Thirteen foliage projective cover (FPC) classes were used in modelling the pasture system to deal with the non-linear relationship between tree and grass interactions. As `proof of concept', remotely-sensed individual-date green ground cover data were used to optimise the GRASP model parameters to improve the model performance, and a Monte Carlo analysis provided uncertainty estimates for model outcomes. The framework provides an efficient and standardised method for estimating LTCC. To test the system, LTCCs from 43 `benchmark' properties were compared with simulated LTCCs, and 65\% of the modelled LTCCs were within +/- 25\% of the benchmark LTCCs. Due to uncertainties in model inputs at the property scale and in model simulation, the modelled LTCC should be used as a starting point for further refinement of actual property LTCC.",adult equivalent; domestic livestock carrying capacity; land condition; optimisation; safe utilisation,2021,43,3,10.1071/RJ20088,1036-9872,20,152,250,1662,5,8,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,A camera trap-based assessment of climate-driven phenotypic plasticity of seasonal moulting in an endangered carnivore,"For many species, the ability to rapidly adapt to changes in seasonality is essential for long-term survival. In the Arctic, seasonal moulting is a key life-history event that provides year-round camouflage and thermal protection. However, increased climatic variability of seasonal events can lead to phenological mismatch. In this study, we investigated whether winter-white (white morph) and winter-brown (blue morph) Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) could adjust their winter-to-summer moult to match local environmental conditions. We used camera trap images spanning an eight-year period to quantify the timing and rate of fur change in a polymorphic subpopulation in south-central Norway. Seasonal snow cover duration and temperature governed the phenology of the spring moult. We observed a later onset and longer moulting duration with decreasing temperature and longer snow season. Additionally, white foxes moulted earlier than blue in years with shorter periods of snow cover and warmer temperatures. These results suggest that phenotypic plasticity allows Arctic foxes to modulate the timing and rate of their spring moult as snow conditions and temperatures fluctuate. With the Arctic warming at an unprecedented rate, understanding the capacity of polar species to physiologically adapt to a changing environment is urgently needed in order to develop adaptive conservation efforts. Moreover, we provide the first evidence for variations in the moulting phenology of blue and white Arctic foxes. Our study underlines the different intraspecific selective pressures that can exist in populations where several morphs co-occur, and illustrates the importance of integrating morph-based differences in future management strategies of such polymorphic species.",camera trapping; camouflage; climate change; colour polymorphism; phenological mismatch; phenotypic plasticity,2023,9,2,10.1002/rse2.304,NA,15,118,252,1768,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Camera trapping with photos and videos: implications for ecology and citizen science,"Camera traps are increasingly used in wildlife monitoring and citizen science to address an array of ecological questions on a wide variety of species. However, despite the ability of modern camera traps to capture high-quality video, the majority of studies collect still images, in part because of concerns with video performance. We conducted a camera trap survey of a forested landscape in the UK, using a grid of paired camera traps, to quantify the impact of using video compared to photos on the outcomes of ecological research and for participation and engagement of citizen scientists. Ecological outputs showed no difference between photo and video datasets, but comparison between expert and citizen science classifications showed citizen scientists were able to classify videos more accurately (average accuracy of 95\% for video, 86\% for photo). Furthermore, citizen scientists were more likely to volunteer additional information on age (provided for 61\% videos and 30\% photos) and sex (provided for 63\% videos and 45\% photos) of animals in video footage. Concerns over slow trigger speeds for videos did not appear to affect our datasets or the inferences gained. When combined with citizen science, video datasets are likely to be of higher quality due to increased classification accuracy. Consequently, we encourage researchers to consider the use of video for future camera-trapping projects.",activity level; camera traps; citizen science; occupancy; species diversity,2023,9,2,10.1002/rse2.309,NA,12,84,216,1416,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Exploring the link between spectral variance and upper canopy taxonomic diversity in a tropical forest: influence of spectral processing and feature selection,"The rapid loss of biodiversity in tropical rainforests calls for new remote sensing approaches capable of providing rapid estimates of biodiversity over large areas. Imaging spectroscopy has shown potential for the estimation of taxonomic diversity, but the link with spectral diversity has not been investigated extensively with experimental data so far. We explored the relationship between taxonomic diversity and visible to near infrared spectral variance derived from various spectral processing techniques by means of a labeled dataset comprising 2000 individual tree crowns from 200 species from an experimental tropical forest station in French Guiana. We generated a set of artificially assembled communities covering a broad range of taxonomic diversity from this experimental dataset. We analyzed the impact of various processing steps: spectral normalization, spectral transformation through principal component analysis, and feature selection. Correlation between taxonomic diversity and inter-specific spectral variance was strong. Correlation was lower with total spectral variance, with or without normalization and transformation. Dimensionality reduction through feature selection resulted in dramatic improvement of the correlation between Shannon index and spectral variance. While airborne diversity mapping of tropical forest may not be at hand yet, our results confirm that spectral diversity metrics, when computed on properly preprocessed and selected spectral information can predict taxonomic diversity in tropical ecosystems.",Biodiversity mapping; features selection; forest canopy; imaging spectroscopy; spectral diversity; tropical forest biodiversity,2023,9,2,10.1002/rse2.306,NA,22,158,209,1553,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Imperfect detection and wildlife density estimation using aerial surveys with infrared and visible sensors,"Aerial vehicles equipped with infrared thermal sensors facilitate quick density estimates of wildlife, but detection error can arise from the thermal sensor and viewer of the infrared video. We reviewed published research to determine how commonly these sources of error have been assessed in studies using infrared video from aerial platforms to sample wildlife. The number of annual articles pertaining to aerial sampling using infrared thermography has increased drastically since 2018, but past studies inconsistently assessed sources of imperfect detection. We illustrate the importance of accounting for some of these types of error in a case study on white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus in Indiana, USA, using a simple double-observer approach. In our case study, we found evidence of false negatives associated with the viewer of infrared video. Additionally, we found that concordance between the detections of two viewers increased when using a red-green-blue camera paired with the infrared thermal sensor, when altitude decreased and when more stringent criteria were used to classify thermal signatures as deer. We encourage future managers and ecologists recording infrared video from aerial platforms to use double-observer methods to account for viewer-induced false negatives when video is manually viewed by humans. We also recommend combining infrared video with red-green-blue video to reduce false positives, applying stringent verification standards to detections in infrared and red-green-blue video and collecting data at lower altitudes over snow when needed.",Density estimation; detection error; drones; infrared video; Odocoileus virginianus; thermal sensor,2023,9,2,10.1002/rse2.305,NA,14,106,229,1589,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Prospects for monitoring bird migration along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway using weather radar,"Each year, billions of birds migrate across the globe, and interpretation of weather radar signals is increasingly being used to document the spatial and temporal migration patterns in Europe and America. Such approaches are yet to be applied in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF), one of the most species-rich and threatened flyways in the world. Logistical challenges limit direct on-ground monitoring of migratory birds in many parts of the EAAF, resulting in knowledge gaps on population status and site use that limit evidence-based conservation planning. Weather radar data have great potential for achieving comprehensive migratory bird monitoring along the EAAF. In this study, we discuss the feasibility and challenges of using weather radar to complement on-ground bird migration surveys in the flyway. We summarize the location, capacity and data availability of weather radars across EAAF countries, as well as the spatial coverage of the radars with respect to migrants' geographic distribution and migration hotspots along the flyway, with an exemplar analysis of biological movement patterns extracted from Chinese weather radars. There are more than 430 weather radars in EAAF countries, covering on average half of bird species' passage and non-breeding distributions, as well as 70\% of internationally important sites for migratory shorebirds. We conclude that the weather radar network could be a powerful resource for monitoring bird movements over the full annual cycle throughout much of the EAAF, providing estimates of migration traffic rates, site use, and long-term population trends, especially in remote and less-surveyed regions. Analyses of weather radar data would complement existing ornithological surveys and help understand the past and present status of the avian community in a highly threatened flyway.",Annual cycle; EAAF; East Asian-Australasian Flyway; migration; remote sensing; weather radar,2023,9,2,10.1002/rse2.307,NA,13,100,273,1848,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Remote sensing-supported mapping of the activity of a subterranean landscape engineer across an afro-alpine ecosystem,"Subterranean animals act as ecosystem engineers, for example, through soil perturbation and herbivory, shaping their environments worldwide. As the occurrence of animals is often linked to above-ground features such as plant species composition or landscape textures, satellite-based remote sensing approaches can be used to predict the distribution of subterranean species. Here, we combine insitu collected vegetation composition data with remotely sensed data to improve the prediction of a subterranean species across a large spatial scale. We compared three machine learning-based modeling strategies, including field and satellite-based remote sensing data to different extents, in order to predict the distribution of the subterranean giant root-rat GRR, Tachyoryctes macrocephalus, an endangered rodent species endemic to the Bale Mountains in southeast Ethiopia. We included no, some and extensive fieldwork data in the modeling to test how these data improved prediction quality. We found prediction quality to be particularly dependent on the spatial coverage of the training data. Species distributions were best predicted by using texture metrics and eyeball-selected data points of landscape marks created by the GRR. Vegetation composition as a predictor showed the lowest contribution to model performance and lacked spatial accuracy. Our results suggest that the time-consuming collection of vegetation data in the field is not necessarily required for the prediction of subterranean species that leave traceable above-ground landscape marks like the GRR. Instead, remotely sensed and spatially eyeball-selected presence data of subterranean species could profoundly enhance predictions. The usage of remote sensing-derived texture metrics has great potential for improving the distribution modeling of subterranean species, especially in arid ecosystems.",afro-alpine ecosystems; ecosystem engineer; machine learning; remote sensing; species distribution; subterranean animals,2023,9,2,10.1002/rse2.303,NA,15,117,258,1872,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Using airborne lidar to characterize North European terrestrial high-dark-diversity habitats,"A key aspect of nature conservation is knowledge of which aspects of nature to conserve or restore to favor the characteristic diversity of plants in a given area. Here, we used a large plant dataset with >40 000 plots combined with airborne laser scanning (lidar) data to reveal the local characteristics of habitats having a high plant dark diversity-that is, absence of suitable species-at national extent (>43 000 km(2)). Such habitats have potential for reaching high realized diversity levels and hence are important in a conservation context. We calculated 10 different lidar based metrics (both terrain and vegetation structure) and combined these with seven different field-based measures (soil chemistry and species indicators). We then used Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation for modelling plant dark diversity across 33 North European habitat types (open landscapes and forests) selected by the European communities to be important. In open habitat types high-dark-diversity habitats had relatively low pH, high nitrogen content, tall homogenous vegetation, and overall relatively homogenous terrains (high terrain openness) although with a rather high degree of local microtopographical variations. High-dark-diversity habitats in forests had relatively tall vegetation, few natural-forest indicators, low potential solar radiation input and a low cover of small woody plants. Our results highlight important vegetation, terrain- and soil-related factors that managers and policymakers should be aware of in conservation and restoration projects to ensure a natural plant diversity, for example low nutrient loads, natural microtopography and possibly also open forests with old-growth elements such as dead wood and rot attacks.",Dark diversity; lidar; plant diversity; terrain structure; vegetation ecology; vegetation structure,2023,9,3,10.1002/rse2.314,NA,10,92,250,1747,6,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Beyond tree cover: Characterizing southern China's forests using deep learning,"Mapping forests with satellite images at local to global scale is done on a routine basis, but to go beyond the mapping of forest cover and towards characterizing forests according to their types, species and use, requires a dense time-series of images. This knowledge is important, because ecological and economic values differ between forests. A new generation of low cost very high spatial resolution satellite images and the advent of deep learning enables improved abilities for distinguishing objects based on their structure, which could potentially also be applied to map different forest classes related to type, species and use. Here we use GF-1 images at 2 m resolution and map six forest classes including different planted species for the karst region in southwest China, covering 806,900 km(2). We compare the results with field data and show that accuracies range between 78\% and 90\%. We show a dominance of plantations (15\%) and secondary forests (70\%), and only remnants of natural forests (6\%). The possibility to map forest classes based on their crown structure derived from low cost very high-resolution satellite imagery paves the road towards sustainable forest management and restoration activities, supporting the creation of connected habitats, increasing biodiversity and improved carbon storage. No temporal information is needed for our approach, which saves costs and leads to rapid results that can be updated at a high temporal frequency.",Deep learning; forest types; karst; monoculture plantations; remote sensing,2022,NA,NA,10.1002/rse2.292,NA,10,78,227,1475,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Deep learning algorithm outperforms experienced human observer at detection of blue whale D-calls: a double-observer analysis,"An automated algorithm for passive acoustic detection of blue whale D-calls was developed based on established deep learning methods for image recognition via the DenseNet architecture. The detector was trained on annotated acoustic recordings from the Antarctic, and performance of the detector was assessed by calculating precision and recall using a separate independent dataset also from the Antarctic. Detections from both the human analyst and automated detector were then inspected by an independent judge to identify any calls missed by either approach and to adjudicate whether the apparent false-positive detections from the automated approach were actually true positives. A final performance assessment was conducted using double-observer methods (via a closed-population Huggins mark-recapture model) to assess the probability of detection of calls by both the human analyst and automated detector, based on the assumption of false-positive-free adjudicated detections. According to our double-observer analysis, the automated detector showed superior performance with higher recall and fewer false positives than the original human analyst, and with performance similar to existing top automated detectors. To understand the performance of both detectors we inspected the time-series and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of detections for the test dataset, and found that most of the advantages from the automated detector occurred at low and medium SNR.",automated detector; blue whale; deep-learning; double-observer; passive acoustics,2022,NA,NA,10.1002/rse2.297,NA,16,125,207,1463,5,NA,300,6,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
RESTORATION ECOLOGY,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi enhance the drought resistance more significantly of the late-successional psammophytes than that of the early ones,"Improving drought tolerance of psammophytes is a challenge for vegetation restoration in arid lands. Despite extensive reports on the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on plant resistance, its enhancements of drought resistance for psammophytes from different successions stages have been rarely explored. Here, seedlings of the Artemisia wudanica (early succession), Hedysarum fruticosum (middle succession), and the Caragana korshinskii (late succession) were selected to investigate the effect of AMF on the growth of psammophytes in different successional stages. We found that the mycorrhizal colonization of late-successional psammophytes with the AMF was greater than that of the early and mid-successional psammophytes. The effect of AMF on drought resistance was stronger in late-successional psammophytes and the promotion effect increased with the intensity of drought. The AMF reduced the difference between aboveground and belowground plant growth and promoted more belowground growth of psammophytes in the late-successional stage. We concluded that AMF can enhance the drought resistance of psammophytes and has a more significant effect on the growth of plants from the late-successional stage.

We conducted a pan-Canadian study using semi-structured interviews with restoration professionals to explore the extent to which restoration practitioners are aware of the document and use it. Overall, we found that direct uptake of the document by practitioners was lower than expected, with approximately 37.7\% of all participants that were both aware of and consulting the publication for guidance in their practice of ecological restoration. This is due in part to low awareness of the document itself, with only a small majority (56.5\%) of interviewees being aware of it. Other reasons listed by practitioners such as the structure of the publication, its added value, and its suitability for on-the-ground work revealed why some individuals aware of the existence of the document still failed to consult it. Here, we present a more nuanced assessment of these observations and share our findings with the ecological restoration community to address this disconnection. With intensifying pressures to achieve restoration success internationally, SER's guidance is critical. We analyze why it seems guidance from SER is not being taken up as fully as it might, and ways in which future versions may be improved.",adoption of principles; professional practice; restoration community; standards,2023,31,1,10.1111/rec.13789,1061-2971,21,153,212,1389,4,NA,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
RESTORATION ECOLOGY,Co-occurring bunchgrasses are associated with different plant species in dry pine savannas,"Grass species are often included during restoration to reinstate feedbacks with fire. In biodiverse pine savannas of the southeastern United States, wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana) is the preferred candidate for restoring low-intensity fires through the understory. Less common but locally co-dominant in dry pine savannas, pineywoods dropseed (Sporobolus junceus) is another bunchgrass candidate for restoration. If two bunchgrass species associate with different suites of plants in the understory, restoring both could support a twofold goal of restoring fire regimes and plant biodiversity. To guide restoration goals, we tested the hypothesis that in natural (i.e. not recently restored) dry pine savannas in North Florida where wiregrass and dropseed are co-dominant, they are associated with different understory plant species richness, occurrence, and abundance under or adjacent to their canopies. Species richness of associated plants did not differ between bunchgrass species or with distance from bunchgrass (i.e. under vs. adjacent). Some associated plant species, however, were more likely to occur and had greater abundance with one or the other bunchgrass species irrespective of distance. Our results suggest that including more than one bunchgrass species in restoration plantings could increase dry pine savanna biodiversity while also reinstating plant-fire feedbacks.",biodiversity; ecosystem functions; habitat conservation; habitat restoration; longleaf pine savannas; plant associations,2023,31,5,10.1111/rec.13830,1061-2971,12,90,194,1389,6,NA,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

The inorganic nitrogen content, soil nitrogen mineralization, ammonification, and nitrification rate of uninvaded mudflats with those of invaded S. alterniflora site and native Kandelia obovata site at different restoration stages were compared. The results showed that the NH4+-N was the dominant form of soil inorganic nitrogen at all sites. Owing to its higher ammonification rates, the nitrogen mineralization rates at S. alterniflora site were highest in spring and summer among all sites except for mudflat. The young mangrove (1 year and 8 years) had significantly higher soil inorganic nitrogen content but lower nitrogen mineralization than the mature mangrove, indicated the short-term response to restoration. The S. alterniflora invasion did not enhance soil nitrogen mineralization comparing with preinvaded mudflat, but it used more NH4+-N relative to K. obovata due to its higher soil nitrogen mineralization than mangrove communities in germination and growing seasons.",inorganic nitrogen; Kandelia obovata; mangrove restoration; soil nitrogen mineralization rate; Spartina alterniflora,2023,31,5,10.1111/rec.13833,1061-2971,16,128,180,1250,5,NA,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

RESTORATION ECOLOGY,"Post-fire restoration of Sphagnum bogs in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, Australia","Sphagnum bogs in Australia are small, with a limited distribution, but of high conservation value. They are restricted to cool, wet environments that are typically fire free and are poorly adapted to recover from fire disturbance, unlike most Australian flora. Increased fire activity due to anthropogenic climate change is threatening Sphagnum bogs. This increased threat has stimulated interest in their restoration. Compared with the northern hemisphere, there have been few studies of the ecology of Sphagnum restoration in the southern hemisphere. Here, we report on a field experiment in Tasmania, in an area burned by an extensive fire in 2016. We investigated the role of shade, fertilizer and transplants, factors demonstrated to be important in the restoration of burnt bogs on the Australian mainland. Treatments commenced three to 4 years after the fire. Overall, we found that fire-damaged Sphagnum recovers very slowly, and that there was no recovery in severely burned areas. The addition of shade increased recovery of damaged Sphagnum, but fertilizer was harmful, even to healthy Sphagnum. Transplants in fire-killed Sphagnum grew poorly in both moderately and severely burnt Sphagnum areas.

RESTORATION ECOLOGY,Seed- versus transplant-based eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) restoration success in a temperate marine lake,"Despite active seagrass restoration gaining traction as a tool to halt and reverse worldwide seagrass losses, overall success remains limited. Restoration strategies, through seeding or transplantation, face different environmental bottlenecks that limit success. Choosing the most appropriate strategy of the two for a specific location, however, is hampered by lack of direct practical comparisons between strategies within a single system. To investigate potential life stage dependent bottlenecks, we compared seed-based and transplant-based restoration of Zostera marina in the subtidal saltwater Lake Grevelingen. Our results demonstrate that seedling recruitment was negatively impacted by bioturbation from the lugworm Arenicola marina and sediment movement due to hydrodynamic exposure. Transplant-based restoration was clearly more successful but surprisingly best predicted by leaf gluing by the ragworm Platynereis dumerilii. This previously undescribed interaction caused seagrass leaves to clump and reduce effective photosynthetic surface and leaf movement. We suggest that the observed behavior of these worms may result from a lack of foodweb interactions, illustrating the importance of trophic control for seagrass restoration. Thus, in addition to recognizing life stage dependent environmental bottlenecks for restoration strategy selection, seagrass restoration may also require the active recovery of their associated food webs.",Arenicola marina; hydrodynamics; leaf gluing; Platynereis dumerilii; sediment working; seedling recruitment; seedling survival; transplant survival; Zostera marina,2023,31,1,10.1111/rec.13786,1061-2971,14,105,193,1451,9,NA,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Although dam decommissioning aims at improving in-stream habitat, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning in the long term, it might also cause ecological impacts in the short term due to the mobilization of the sediment accumulated in the reservoir. Benthic biofilm in particular can be impaired by episodes of high turbidity and scouring. We conducted a multiple before-after/control-impact experiment to assess the effects of the drawdown of a large dam (42 m tall), a first step to its decommissioning, on biofilm structure (biomass and chlorophyll-a) and functioning (metabolism, nutrient uptake, and organic matter breakdown). Our results show that the reservoir drawdown reduced the autotrophic biofilm biomass (chlorophyll-a) downstream from the dam, which in turn lowered metabolism. However, nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by the biofilm was not affected. Organic matter breakdown was slower below the dam than in nearby undammed reaches before and during drawdown. All drawdown effects quickly disappeared and reaches downstream from the dam approached values found in nearby undammed reaches. Thus, our results indicate that the effects of reservoir drawdown on stream biofilms exist but may be small and disappear rapidly.",before-after; control-impact; connectivity restoration; dam removal; mountain stream; reservoir drawdown; sediment release,2023,31,1,10.1111/rec.13779,1061-2971,12,86,199,1357,7,NA,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

However, standard methods for defining the reference ecosystem, selecting reference sites, and measuring success are surprisingly lacking. Our study develops these methods based on the acceptable range of variation (ARV) within the desirable stable (reference) state as a measure of restoration success. The method (1) constrains application to the contemporary landscape to avoid the problematic historical range of variation concept and idealized restoration targets; (2) acknowledges the theory of alternative stable states and ecosystem dynamics and posits that the reference ecosystem should be clearly defined as a desirable stable (reference) state; and (3) shows that identifying an acceptable thematic (classification) scale and an acceptable management timeframe is essential to defining the desirable stable (reference) state.

In this study, we analyze the biodeposition of waste products egested by native herbivorous mammals of the Monte Desert to document for the first time the implications of the restoration of a native forest on this process. We compared a restored native woodland an adjacent grazing field in terms of the spatial distribution of waste products, the biodiversity of trophic items stored in fecal pellets, and the C:N ratio as a predictor of nutrients supplied to the soil. We found that fecal pellets of mammal species were intermingled and spatially distributed throughout the entire landscape, but they were more abundant in the restoration area, indicating the influence of land management types on the distribution process. The two mammal species presented different feeding strategies; however, the plant species consumed in the grazing field indicate decreased food options for native mammals, meaning a smaller amplitude of their trophic niches under this land management. The low C:N ratio and the high nitrogen pool provided by the pellets in the restoration area suggest a potential benefit to plant communities. However, the higher organic C jointly with the lower C:N ratio observed in fecal pellets of grazing field indicate a low decomposability which could promote the conservation of C in the soil.",arid lands; mobile linkers; native species; restoration; soil nutrients,2023,31,"6, SI",10.1111/rec.13809,1061-2971,21,147,223,1422,5,NA,250,8,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
RESTORATION ECOLOGY,Tree logs for grassland restoration? Lessons from an unintentional experiment,"For subtropical Brazilian grasslands, few restoration techniques are established, and seeds of native grassland species are not available on the market. Here, we evaluated the effect of physical barriers (PB) on vegetation recovery in a degraded grassland. We considered species that exhibit attributes in their diaspores that facilitate dispersal as well-dispersed species (WDS) and compared the proportion of WDS at our site to their proportion in the regional species pool. To analyze plots near and distant from the PB, we calculated the extrapolated metrics by an asymptotic estimator (double sample size of each distance). We found 74 species in the degraded area, with higher richness and Shannon diversity values closer to logs, but higher Simpson values with larger distance from logs. Almost half of the species in the degraded area are WDS, more than in the regional species pool. While effects of logs on microsite conditions may also play a role (e.g. logs accumulating organic material or increasing soil moisture, providing shade), our data indicates that the PB works as a seed trap favoring the occurrence of WDS.

REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,"A study of composition and diversity variation of avifauna along with different types of agroforestry system in Kibet town, Southern Ethiopia","Background Agroforestry is an integrated land-use system that plays a great role in the conservation of landscape biodiversity. The study aimed to assess the composition and diversity of avian species along with different habitat types of agroforestry in Kibet Town, Southern Ethiopia. Methods Four habitat types of agroforestry system which are home gardens, live fences, parkland, and eucalyptus woodlot were identified. Line transects were used for bird surveys. The Shannon diversity index (H `) and species evenness index (E) were used to compare diversity among habitat types. A similarity percentages (SIMPER) test was carried out to identify the main species and feeding guild that typified each habitat type. The overall significance was assessed with the ANOSIM test using PAST (version 4.03). Results A total of 50 bird species belonging to 28 families and 10 orders were recorded. Order Passeriformes (67.3\%) had the highest number of species. Bird community composition differed among habitat types. The dissimilarity was mainly due to White-browed robin-chat (Cossypha heuglini), Streaky seed-eater (Serinus striolatus), Village Weaver (Ploceus cucullatus), African Paradise-Flycatcher (Terpsiphone viridis), and Black-Headed Paradise Flycatcher (T. rufiventer). The finding also revealed that insectivore was the dominant feeding guild. Conclusions The present study shows evidence that more insectivore bird species use different types of agroforestry as habitat and foraging sites. So, any concerned bodies who have engaged in avian conservation should give special consideration to this modified landscape.",Agroforestry; Avifauna; Feeding guilds; Insectivores; Kibet Town; Land-use,2022,95,1,10.1186/s40693-021-00106-2,0716-078X,21,141,231,1625,6,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,Effects of landscape configuration on the occurrence and abundance of an arboreal marsupial from the Valdivian rainforest,"Background Habitat fragmentation and degradation processes affect biodiversity by reducing habitat quantity and quality, with differential effects on the resident species. However, their consequences are not always noticeable as some ecological processes affected involve idiosyncratic responses among different animal groups. The Valdivian temperate rainforests of southern Chile are experiencing a rapid fragmentation and degradation process despite being a biodiversity hotspot. Deforestation is one of the main threats to these forests. There inhabits the arboreal marsupial Dromiciops gliroides, an iconic species from the Valdivian rainforest, it is the only extant representative of the ancient Microbiotheria order, and it is currently threatened by habitat loss. Here we tested the effects of habitat configuration on D. gliroides occurrence and abundance along 12 landscapes of southern Chile with different disturbance levels. Methods We estimated D. gliroides occurrence and abundance using camera traps and related those metrics with landscape configuration indices obtained from FRAGSTATS (i.e., forest \%, connectivity, patch number, contiguity, and distance to the nearest patch) using Bayesian linear mixed models. Results We found that D. gliroides occurrence was not influenced by landscape configuration, while its abundance was positively influenced by forest contiguity. Conclusions Although this arboreal marsupial is present in disturbed forests, its restricted movement capabilities and high dependency on the forest three-dimensional structure may affect its long-term persistence. We urge to rethink native forest conservation and management policies to improve habitat connectivity with possible positive consequences for native fauna.",Abundance; Dromiciops gliroides; Habitat degradation; Habitat fragmentation; Landscape; Occurrence,2022,95,1,10.1186/s40693-022-00107-9,0716-078X,17,121,237,1763,6,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,Rivers as a potential dispersing agent of the invasive tree Acacia dealbata,"Background The silver wattle Acacia dealbata is a fast-growing tree from Australia that has become naturalised in different regions of the world, attaining invasive status in most of them. In Chile, A. dealbata reaches large abundances along banks and floodplains of invaded fluvial systems, suggesting that rivers may act as a vector for seed dispersal. As hydrochory has not been documented previously in this species, the aim of this study is to evaluate the potential for water dispersal of seeds of this invasive tree along rivers. Methods Seed samples from rivers were collected at three sites along two A. dealbata-invaded rivers within the Cachapoal basin, central Chile. Number of seeds collected was contrasted versus hydraulic and local conditions with RDA. Seed buoyancy and sedimentation velocity were determined and compared between sites with an ANCOVA. Finally, the probability of seed germination after long periods of immersion in water was assessed, simulating transport conditions in the flow. Germination results were tested with a GLM. Results Results indicate that increasing abundance of A. dealbata seeds in the flow is related to the level of turbulence of the flow. Seeds display high floatability but their sedimentation velocity is high when they do sink. Finally, silver wattle seeds can germinate after long periods (many weeks) of immersion in water; however, their probability of germination depends to a large extent on whether seeds are scarified or not. Conclusions Based on the evidence collected, we suggest that the seeds of A. dealbata have the necessary traits to be dispersed by rivers, this being the first research testing this hypothesis. The success of hydrochory of A. dealbata would depend on river flow turbulence, and whether there are natural mechanisms for scarifying the seeds either before or during transport. The proposed methodology can be used to assess river hydrochory for any tree species.",Chile; Hydrochory; Seed buoyancy; Seed scarification; Silver wattle; Water dispersal,2022,95,1,10.1186/s40693-022-00109-7,0716-078X,12,75,304,1950,6,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,Spatial dissimilarity of zooplankton and hydrodynamic conditions in a Patagonian channel used intensely by aquaculture: the influence of a geomorphological constriction,"Background Marine aquaculture is a very important economic and food production activity in Patagonian channels. The biophysical mechanisms through which farms interact with surrounding areas is poorly understood. A better understanding of the relationship between zooplankton distribution, hydrodynamics and aquaculture farms in Patagonian channels can contribute to the environmental sustainability of this activity. Methods The study was conducted in winter in the Caucahue Channel (Chiloe Island, southern Chile), which is composed of two asymmetric northern and southern sections separated by a geomorphological constriction (a narrows) and hosts 55 aquaculture farms. Intensive zooplankton and water column sampling (time scale: 12 h) was carried out, together with current measurements as a background of the channel hydrodynamics (time scale: 30 days). Results Spatial dissimilarities in composition and abundances of zooplankton communities and in water column variables were identified between the two sections of the channel in this short-term time scale. In the southern section we found higher abundances of holo- and meroplankton and higher species richness. No differences in zooplankton community were found between sampling sites near and far from aquaculture farms. Southward asymmetrical residual flow and semidiurnal tidal excursion were verified in the central part of the channel during two tidal fortnightly time periods. Conclusions (i) Clear dissimilarity in zooplankton composition were found between the two sections of Caucahue Channel in the time scale studied; and (ii) Quemchi geomorphological constriction and the asymmetrical southward residual flow could act as a physical barrier favoring the spatial dissimilarities found in biotic and abiotic variables between the two sections of the channel.",Aquaculture zoning; Coastal circulation; Plankton transport; Mussel farms; Salmon farms,2022,95,1,10.1186/s40693-022-00111-z,0716-078X,21,168,257,1829,5,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,The impact of protected areas on poverty: evidence from Chile,"In this paper, we estimate the causal relationship between protected areas and poverty in Chile from 1982 to 2002. Chile is part of the coalition of countries committed to protecting 30\% of the planet by 2030; a decision that implies increasing the number of protected areas in the country. As a result of this decision, grows the national debate about the potential impacts of protected areas on the economy and society. By estimating the causal effect of protected areas on poverty, we aim to contribute to this debate in Chile. We use panel data and a quasi-experimental approach to estimate the causal effect. We find that establishing a protected area covering at least 17\% of a unit's terrestrial area causes a reduction of 0.216 standard deviations in the poverty index. This result is not sensitive to arbitrary implementation choices. Additionally, we show that the effect is driven by the Patagonia region, the part of Chile with the largest amount of new protected areas during the time frame of this study. Besides showing the benefits of protected areas to society, we hope the findings presented here might also be used to attract new investments and financial support to protected areas currently underfunded in Chile.",Protected areas; Poverty; Chile; Patagonia; Differences-in-Differences,2022,95,1,10.1186/s40693-022-00110-0,0716-078X,10,61,203,1235,5,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,A comprehensive overview of the genetic diversity in Thylamys elegans (Didelphimorphia: Didelphidae): establishing the phylogeographic determinants,"Background For the genus Thylamys, the rivers have been reported as barriers to dispersal, limiting current and historical distribution of its lineages. We hypothesized that the Maipo river has affected the genetic structure of northern and southern lineages of Thylamys elegans, recovering a phylogenetic relationships with reciprocally monophyletic sister groups on opposite river banks. We evaluated the role of other rivers in the Mediterranean zone of Chile as historical and recent modulators of the biogeographic processes of this species. Methods We applied a phylogeographic approach, using the cytochrome-b mitochondrial gene for 93 individuals of T. elegans, from 37 localities in a latitudinal gradient between 21 degrees 25' and 3556'S, encompassing a geographic area between the Atacama Desert and most of the Mediterranean Chilean zone. Results The phylogenetics results recovered six lineages within T. elegans: Thylamys elegans elegans, Thylamys elegans coquimbensis, the Loa lineage and three other lineages not described previously (Aconcagua, South 1 and South 2). We suggest that following rivers play a role like primary barrier: the Maipo river in the genetic differentiation of northern and southern ancestral lineages, and the Mataquito river and its tributary Teno river for the South 1 and South 2 lineages. On the other hand, the Quilimari river preserve the genetic divergence in T. e. coquimbensis and Aconcagua lineage and the Aconcagua river in Aconcagua lineage and T. e. elegans acting like secondary barriers. Conclusions We concluded that the genetic diversity and biogeographic history of T. elegans was shaped by mountain glaciers, changes in river water levels during the Pleistocene glaciations and hyperaridity, promoting the differentiation and persistance of the T. elegans lineages.",Rivers; Mountains; Glaciations; Hiperaridity; Lineages,2021,94,1,10.1186/s40693-021-00103-5,0716-078X,16,147,269,1826,5,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,Macrofauna community patterns in a Chiloe Island channel used intensely for aquaculture: the ecological status of its benthic environment,"Background It is known that aquaculture may produce negative environmental effects on marine ecosystems. Southern Chile is one of the most important salmon and mussel-producing areas in the world. Here we assess the ecological status of benthic communities near farming centers in Caucahue Channel, Chiloe, which has been used intensely for salmon and mussel production for 30 years. Methods The macrofauna, sediments and water column were characterized at distances of 5 to 100 m from three salmon and three mussel-producing centers. Information was also obtained from reference sites 500 to 3000 m from these aquaculture farms. The macrofauna and environmental conditions during winter were analyzed using uni- and multivariate analysis and the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) as an indicator of benthic community condition. Results (i) There is a high degree of spatial dissimilarity in macrofauna and environmental variables among sampling sites and types of environments (far from or near farming centers) and between the northern and southern areas of the channel; (ii) sediment structure (mean grain size and percentage of total organic matter) correlated with the observed dissimilarities in macrofauna communities; and (iii) the level of perturbation according to AMBI was heterogeneous, with sites in the undisturbed/normal range to moderately disturbed/polluted. Conclusions We found a high spatial dissimilarity in benthic macrofauna and environmental variables among sampling sites, environmental types and between the northern and southern areas of the channel.

REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,"Structure, composition and carbon stocks of woody plant community in assisted and unassisted ecological succession in a Tamaulipan thornscrub, Mexico","Background Ecological restoration is a process that helps the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged or destroyed. The success of restoration actions depend on the understanding of the processes, mechanisms and factors that guide vegetation dynamics. The restoration of plant communities can be made by unassisted (passive restoration, where the community recover by itself) and assisted (active restoration) ecological succession. It is imperative to know the scope of both types of activities to guide future restoration actions by evaluating the properties and functioning of the intervened communities. Methods Variance analysis of the carbon (C) stocks, basal area, canopy area, Shannon-Weaver index values, specific richness and abundance of three Tamaulipan thornscrub communities (assisted natural succession area, unassisted natural succession area and control area) was performed. Furthermore, a similarity analysis between the sampling areas using the floristic composition (abundance) was performed. Results In total, 11 families, 17 genera and 20 species of vascular plants were registered. The richness of species and abundance ranked as follows per area: assisted ecological natural succession > control > unassisted ecological natural succession. The species composition between sampling areas showed a low number of common species between plant communities. Conclusions The values of species richness, diversity, abundance, basal area, and canopy area of the assisted natural succession vegetal community was statistical similar to the control plan community. The values of C stocks showed that assisted ecological succession could recover not only structure and composition attributes but also this key ecosystem property.",Ecological restoration; Plant communities; Post-agricultural restoration; Xerophytic scrub; Community ecological properties,2021,94,1,10.1186/s40693-021-00102-6,0716-078X,20,149,247,1758,5,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,Assessment of intestinal parasites in the coexisting Bombus terrestris (Apidae) and Xylocopa augusti (Apidae) in central Chile,"Bombus terrestris is a European bumblebee extensively commercialized worldwide for crop pollination. In Chile, this species was introduced in 1997 and after confinement escape, it has spread and established in several localities of central-southern Chile and in the Argentine Patagonia. The South American carpenter bee Xylocopa augusti, in turn, has been recently reported in central Chile, and as B. terrestris, this species has become increasingly common, often found in sympatry with B. terrestris in some localities. While intestinal parasites such as the flagellate trypanosome Crithidia bombi, the microsporidium Nosema bombi, and the neogregarine protozoan Apicystis bombi, show high levels of specialization on the Bombus genus, parasites often increase their host range, especially after invading novel habitats, hence creating new infection disease scenarios. In this work, we used molecular techniques to detect the presence of the intestinal pathogens of B. terrestris in coexisting X. augusti from different localities in the Metropolitan Region of Chile. Our results revealed the presence of the three pathogens in B. terrestris only, with population prevalence broadly similar to that reported in other studies. The carpenter bee X. augusti did not show evidence of any of the three parasites examined, indicating that this invader species is not recipient of any of the parasite species present in B. terrestris.",Apicystis bombi; Crithidia bombi; Nosema bombi; Pathogen spillover,2020,93,1,10.1186/s40693-020-00096-7,0716-078X,17,126,211,1429,4,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,Avocado crops as a floral resource for native bees of Chile,"Background Chile is the second largest avocado producer in the world. However, there have been few studies on interactions between native bees and avocado pollination in a Chilean environment. The flowering period of avocado is very sensitive to temperature fluctuations and so environmental conditions, particularly cool temperatures, can have a strong influence on its floral behaviour. Thus, we aimed to determine whether temperature also influences bee visitation rates to avocado flowers or if this was due to the number of available flowers. Moreover, we proposed to verify the attractiveness of avocado flowers to native bees and compare flower handling time and type of floral resource collected between managed and native bees. Methods An avocado orchard of ``Hass{''} cultivar located in the Mediterranean region of Chile was studied during the flowering season of 2016. The frequency of exotic and native bee species in flowers, floral phenology, and environmental temperature were analysed, and the foraging behaviours of exotic and native bee species in avocado flowers compared. Results Five Chilean native and two exotic species were recorded visiting avocado flowers at the studied orchard. The bees generally sought nectar rather than pollen. The European honeybee (Apis mellifera) was the most frequent flower visitor, followed by the native species Colletes cyanescens and Cadeguala occidentalis. There was a strong positive correlation between temperature and number of visits, but no significant correlation between number of open flowers and number of visits. Conclusions Native Chilean bees visited avocado flowers and some of them were frequent floral visitors. They generally sought for nectar rather than pollen and were as fast as honeybees handling avocado flowers. The environmental temperature plays a key role in the frequency of bees in avocado flowers. The warmer weather is related to the higher number of bees visits to avocado flowers.",Temperature; Mediterranean; Apis mellifera; Persea americana; Pollination,2020,93,1,10.1186/s40693-020-00092-x,0716-078X,11,59,297,1971,5,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,Differences in community composition of endophytic fungi between above- and below-ground tissues of Aristolochia chilensis in an arid ecosystem,"Background Endophytic fungi are diverse and ubiquitous in nature, yet studies simultaneously comparing endophyte communities in above- and below-ground plant tissues are relatively scarce. The main goal of our study was to compare the diversity and community composition of endophytic fungi associated with above- and below-ground tissues of the plant Aristolochia chilensis in an arid ecosystem. Endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy leaves and roots of A. chilensis, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was sequenced for phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis. Results A combined total of 457 fungal isolates were cultured from leaf and root tissues, belonging to 54 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The genera Fusarium, Penicillium, Phialemonium and Trichoderma were the most representative endophyte taxa identified in A. chilensis tissues; nevertheless, Fusarium was significantly more dominant in the below-ground community, while foliar endophyte community was dominated by Penicillium. Whereas OTU richness and diversity were not different between below-ground and above-ground tissues, endophyte abundance was on average twice as high in below-ground tissue than in above-ground tissue. Fungal endophyte communities in the two tissue types were significantly dissimilar. Conclusions Results from this study indicate that A. chilensis harbors a similar diversity of endophytic fungi in above- and below-ground tissues. Dominant endophytic fungi were found to be dependent on tissue type, which potentially resulted in marked differences in community structure between above- and below-ground tissues. Ecological processes potentially affecting this pattern are discussed.",Endophytic fungi; Diversity; Community composition; Aristolochia chilensis,2020,93,1,10.1186/s40693-020-00091-y,0716-078X,19,143,233,1698,4,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes

The objective of this study was to assess large scale geographic variation in composition of parasite infracommunities of Galaxias maculatus. Specifically, parasite infracommunities of this species were compared among 11 locations across 9 degrees of latitude and 3 ecosystem types (lake, river and estuary). Most taxa found had been previously reported in Chile and Argentina. However, this is the first report for Tylodelphys sp. in this host in Chile. Furthermore, the cranial parasite Tylodelphys sp. had the highest overall prevalence and abundance compared to other parasite species. Despite the fact that the abundance of Tylodelphys sp. was not significantly correlated with Fulton's condition factor of fish, infected fish seem to have a better body condition compared to uninfected ones. The most important source of variation in composition of infracommunities was the sampling location. Furthermore, fish from lakes have a different composition of parasite infracommunities mainly due to higher abundances of Tylodelphys sp.",Geographic distribution; Estuary; River; Lake; Parasites,2020,93,1,10.1186/s40693-020-00090-z,0716-078X,21,170,190,1289,5,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,Morphological variation in two sigmodontine rodents along the mainland and the Fuegian archipelago in Chilean southern Patagonia,"Background Analysis of morphological variation in archipelagos has been essential to understand the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates. In particular, these natural scenarios allow to assess morphological changes experienced by insular fauna compared to their mainland counterparts. In mammals, morphological changes of insular forms have been observed in size and shape of body and cranial traits. The southern Patagonia of Chile represents a unique scenario to analyze morphological variation in two of the most widely distributed small rodents along western southern South America:Abrothrix olivaceaandOligoryzomys longicaudatus. Methods We applied linear and three-dimensional geometric morphometric tools to analyze the variation in cranial morphology ofA. olivacea(N = 80) andO. longicaudatus(N = 49).Sampled localities were distributed in the mainland and islands of the Fuegian archipelago in Chilean Patagonia. Standard multivariate methods, as Principal Components Analysis, and Logistic Regression models were carried out to evaluate differences in size and shape of crania. Results We detected higher levels of morphological variation in the crania ofA. olivaceaif compared toO. longicaudatus. The variation was associated to cranial size instead of shape. We observed significant differences between insular and mainland individuals inA. olivacea, being the cranium size of this species significantly bigger on islands. Indeed, specimens ofA. olivaceafrom ``Isla Wellington{''}, exhibited the higher increment in cranium size compared to any other mainland and insular site sampled for this species.In contrast, insular and mainland forms ofO. longicaudatusdid not show significant differences in cranial morphology. Conclusions We suggest that the patterns of morphological variation observed in these two small rodents along Patagonia, could be explained in terms of the historical biogeography of the region, and the different ecological features of the studied species.",Abrothrix olivacea; Geometric morphometrics; Linear morphometrics; Oligoryzomys longicaudatus,2020,93,1,10.1186/s40693-020-00094-9,0716-078X,17,128,271,1988,4,NA,350,10,No,375,325,no,yes,yes
REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,"Variability and variation in Rhyncholestes raphanurus Osgood (Paucituberculata, Caenolestidae)","Background Caenolestids are a group of poorly known South American marsupials with a restricted distribution in Paramo and Subparamo environments of the Andes from Colombia and western Venezuela to Bolivia (represented by the genera Caenolestes and Lestoros), and Valdivian rainforest in southern Chile (including a separate population in Chiloe Island) and Argentina, where a single species lives: the Long-nosed shrew opossum (Rhyncholestes raphanurus). The objectives of this work were to analyze the intraspecific variability of R. raphanurus, which includes an anatomical description of the skull and dentition, describe its geographic variation, test for sexual dimorphism, and assess potential differences between continental and Island populations. Methods Linear Mossimann-transformed variables were used to assess sexual differences within a large population (La Picada), compare sexes within other continental populations, and in a separate analysis, compare continental from Island samples. A full model Principal Components Analysis was performed to assess differences between males and females of the continental and Island populations. A thorough description of the skull and teeth of the species and comparisons with other living Caenolestidae is presented. Results Rhyncholestes raphanurus presents little geographic variation, even between Island and continental populations. Similarly, we found no significant difference between sexes of this species in cranial and dental measurements. We provide a detailed description of cranial morphology and its variation, and also, the first description of the occipital bones, which haven't been previously described for any Paucituberculata. Conclusions Comparative studies of continental and Chiloe Island specimens support the treatment of R. raphanurus as a single valid species, especially since morphologic and morphometric differences fall within the extremes of continental populations.

RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,Ecogeographical Potential of the Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. Northward Expansion in European Russia Estimated on the Basis of a Comparison of the Northern Limits of Its Primary and Secondary Ranges,"Field studies made it possible to specify the actual modern Ambrosia artemisiifolia naturalization boundary in European Russia. This boundary passes through the southern parts of Bryansk, Kursk, and Saratov oblasts and through the northern part of Voronezh oblast. The total mileage of field survey routes was some 8900 km; 777 sampling points were surveyed. A comparative ecogeographical analysis and modeling of the species distribution in northern parts of its secondary range in European Russia and primary range in Canada were performed to determine the Ambrosia artemisiifolia potential for further northward expansion. It is established that the main factor limiting its northward expansion is insufficient heat supply during the seed ripening period. To determine the ecogeographical niche of A. artemisiifolia, a global map reflecting the distribution of accumulated degree days >10 degrees C was produced for the period starting from the date of the day length transition through 14 h after the summer solstice and ending with the sustainable transition of autumn temperatures through 0 degrees C (accumulated degree days taking into account the photoperiodic threshold (ADD(ppt))). ADD(ppt) values were determined for the northernmost annual ragweed naturalization points in European Russia and in Canada. A comparison of ecogeographical limits performed on the basis of the heat supply factor showed that the ecogeographical niche currently realized by the species in North America is generally wider in comparison with that in European Russia. Possible reasons behind the insufficient occupation of the A. artemisiifolia environmental niche in European Russia were examined; an assumption that the species can continue its northward expansion has been made. On the basis of the heat supply factor, annual ragweed can spread further to the north in European Russia: to Bryansk, Oryol, Lipetsk, Tambov, Saratov, and Orenburg oblasts; to the southern half of Penza oblast; and to southern parts of Ulyanovsk and Samara oblasts and the Republic of Bashkortostan. The northeastward expansion of the species can be hindered by adverse effects of another factor: insufficient moisture supply. At the northern distribution limit of A. artemisiifolia in Saratov oblast and east of it, the species is in the ecological pessimum zone in terms of both heat and moisture supply.",.mbrosia artemisiifolia; ecogeographical niche; niche modeling and analysis; primary and secondary distribution ranges; ecological distribution potential,2022,13,2,10.1134/S2075111722020023,2075-1117,29,196,358,2378,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes

RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,Ecological Niche Modeling of Galinsoga Ruiz et Pav. Species in the Native and Caucasian Part of the Invasive Ranges,"Adaptations of G. quadriradiata and G. parviflora developed in the tropical climate of the Mexican mountain region determine the nature and extent of the predicted distribution of these species in the Caucasus. The complex factor of humidity is the main factor determining the potential distribution of G. quadriradiata and G. parviflora in the Caucasus (82 and 48\% of the contribution in the Maxent models). Temperature and orographic ENVIREM predictors also play a significant role in the distribution of G. parviflora. The center of the predicted range of G. quadriradiata is located in the humid climate of the Black Sea coast; for G. parviflora, it is located in the relatively moist foothill and mid-mountain regions of the Western Caucasus. The lowest probability of finding both species is predicted in the lowland (steppe) regions and in the arid climate of the Eastern Caucasus. The invasive potential of G. quadriradiata and G. parviflora in the Caucasus is similar: it includes a high degree of overlapping (Schoener's D = 0.76) and the same width (Levins' B = 0.91 and 0.92) of ecological niches and their visual overlapping in the orthogonal space of the analyzed ecological factors.

RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,"Ecogeographical Analysis of the Heracleum persicum, H. mantegazzianum, and H. sosnowskyi Distribution at the Northern Limit of Their Secondary Ranges in Europe","This paper analyzes the distribution of Heracleum persicum, H. mantegazzianum, and H. sosnowskyi at the northern limit of their secondary ranges in Europe based on original and published data. The northernmost H. persicum occurrences are localized in coastal regions in the northern and central parts of the Scandinavian Peninsula (up to 71 degrees N). In Fennoscandia, H. mantegazzianum and H. sosnowskyi were noted up to 69 degrees N. The gradient of climatic resources in the subarctic and temperate zones made it possible to identify factors limiting further expansion of these species in northern Europe and determine their tolerance limits to these factors. The duration of the frostless season at the northern boundary of the secondary range of invasive Heracleum species is 80-150 days. The probability of cold damage to vegetating plants in areas located north of 66 degrees N (i.e., in the northern part of Finland and in the continental northern part of European Russia) is high. The biological minimum for the sum of active air temperatures >= 5 degrees C is 1150 degrees C, while the minimum requirement of the studied plants for the sum of active temperatures >= 10 degrees C is over 450 degrees C. If available thermal resources exceed this level, then invasive Heracleum species can naturalize in climatic conditions of subarctic Europe. The presence of a sustainable snow cover more than 25 cm depth in areas where the minimum winter temperatures are less than -30 degrees C prevents the freezing of renewal buds and seedlings, thus, preserving the viability of plants. It is proposed to use climatic indices computed as ratios between the air temperature and the snow cover depth (or the precipitation amount in winter) as climatic markers characterizing wintering conditions for plants. The main factors limiting the spread and naturalization of invasive Heracleum species in northern Europe are lack of heat, soil freezing to temperatures critical for hibernating plant organs, and early autumn frosts.",Heracleum sosnowskyi; Heracleum mantegazzianum; Heracleum persicum; invasion; northern distribution limit; climatic conditions,2022,13,2,10.1134/S2075111722020138,2075-1117,22,159,321,2022,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes

RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,Testing the Enemy Release Hypothesis in the Invasive Fish Amatitlania nigrofasciata (Perciformes: Cichlidae) in Mexico,"The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) posits that invasive species are released from their natural enemies in their invasive range, which promotes their successful invasion. In this study, we tested the ERH in a population of the convict cichlid Amatitlania nigrofasciata, an invasive species in Mexico. The ERH predicts that the convict cichlid: (a) is not infected by specialist helminth parasites in the invasive range; (b) has lower infection parameter values, as measured through richness, prevalence, abundance and diversity of helminths, than a native species-the redside cichlid Cichlasoma istlanum; and (c) is not affected in its condition factor by the abundance of helminths it carries. The convict cichlid was infected by two (33\%) specialist helminths relative to the six specialist helminths that infect the cichlid in its native range. The convict cichlid had lower helminth richness and diversity than the redside cichlid. However, the prevalence and abundance of the parasite species varied between the host fish. While the prevalence and abundance of the nematode Rhabdochona kidderi was higher in the redside cichlid, the prevalence and abundance of the trematode Uvulifer sp. was higher in the convict cichlid. The condition factor in both host fish was not correlated with helminth abundance. Our results do not agree with the prediction that the convict cichlid is completely released from specialist parasites, nor with the prediction that this invasive species has lower infection parameter values than the native redside cichlid. However, our results agree with the prediction that the abundance of parasite helminths do not affect the cichlid's condition factor.

Brackish water bodies in India are considered by some researchers to be the initial natural range of this polychaete species. This species is currently known to be widely distributed along the coasts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans and along the coasts of the North, Mediterranean, and Caspian seas. Only a few isolated individuals of F..nigmaticus have been found so far along the Crimean coast of the Black Sea, in the coastal zone of Sevastopol, and along the Karadag shores. The colonies described in this study do not constitute reef structures yet, but have already reached high population numbers. The colony has a diameter of 46 cm and comprises 1774 individuals. The settlements of F..nigmaticus are true populations represented by individuals of different sizes, ranging in length from 2 to 39 mm. The populations include both males and females: males account for 56\% and females account for 44\% of the population. The fecundity of the worms expressed as the number of mature eggs per female depends on the body size and varies between 5800 eggs for the body size of 12 mm and 24820 eggs for the body size of 29 mm. The present study describes the morphology of F. enigmaticus using scanning electron microscopy and identifies numerous sensory structures on the surface of the body, gills, and the pygidium for the first time. Judging from the presence of a mass settlement of the polychaete F..nigmaticus in the coastal water areas of the Kerch Strait, it can be presumed that this species has become completely naturalized in the Black Sea.

Moreover, changes are far from being synchronous in different species of these groups. An increase in the population of the Caspian Tern Hydroprogne caspia and its active settlement in the northeast direction were observed in the first half of the 20th century. In recent decades, there has been, on the contrary, a general downward trend in the number. The article discusses in detail the history of the invasion of the species in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland, the spatial distribution, and features of the habitat confinement of nesting birds. It is shown that, unlike other southern invaders of the region, the Caspian Tern has remained a rare species over the past 30-40 years with a tendency to strong population fluctuations. This is probably caused by the lack of a reserve of birds in the nearest breeding areas. It is shown that the Caspian Tern, which is a stenobiont species, usually nests on open sandy biotopes.

In the course of direct observations of the communities of fallow lands and pits, four groups of phytocenoses were identified, reflecting successive stages of succession: gramineous phytocenoses with maintaining their status during the study period; gramineous phytocenoses with subsequent transition to the meadow stage; and early meadow and formed meadow phytocenoses. The temporal dynamics of their species composition and alpha diversity was studied. Differences in indicators of diversity of communities associated with their successional age and physicochemical parameters of soils (agrozems and technozems) were established. Communities of agrozems and technozems differed in the rate of change in alpha diversity indicators. The increase in these indicators occurred significantly faster on agrozems than on technozems. The transition between stages was not accompanied by a significant increase in the diversity of communities on technozems.",serial communities; cluster analysis; restorative succession; alpha diversity; fallow lands; industrial pits; heavy metals,2022,53,3,10.1134/S1067413622030134,1067-4136,16,107,184,1289,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Dynamics of Distribution Boundaries of Epiphytic Macrolichens after Reduction of Emissions from a Copper Smelter,"Natural recovery of forest ecosystems after the termination of impacts caused by emissions from large industrial enterprises gives a clue to their sustainability mechanisms. However, the lack of data on different ecosystem components, natural zones, and emission sources makes it impossible to identify general patterns of restorative successions. This paper examines the distribution and abundance dynamics of macrolichens growing on birch trunks in the southern taiga forests of the Middle Urals affected for many years by emissions from the Middle Ural Copper Smelter. Two periods were compared: (1) period of intense emissions (1995-1997); and (2) period of almost ceased emissions (2014-2016). In the interval between the two studied periods, technogenic boundaries of all studied lichen species distribution have shifted closer to the smelter, and the abundance of most species increased in all pollution zones, including the slightly polluted and background zones. However, the frequency and abundance of the species still go down as the distance to the smelter decreases. The explerent species Tuckermanopsis sepincola demonstrates the opposite response: it disappears from background and slightly polluted areas reaching maximum abundance in the extremely severe pollution zone.",epiphytic lichens; sulfur dioxide; heavy metals; natural recovery; dynamics; sustainability; recolonization; environmental strategies; Middle Urals,2022,53,5,10.1134/S1067413622050083,1067-4136,15,112,185,1287,9,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Dynamics of Projective Coverage and Species Diversity of Grass Communities During Restoration Succession on Fallows and Dumps,"The temporal dynamics of species diversity and projective coverage of herbaceous communities formed on fallows and dumps was studied. Annual studies of these phytocoenotic indicators were carried out in four groups on the territory of the Tagil zone of the Middle Urals in 2006-2019. The successional development of communities depends on edaphic factors. Phytocenoses with a projective coverage and species diversity typical for meadow communities on the background territories develop on agrozems and technozems under conditions of low soil contamination with heavy metals. The meadow stage under conditions of high pollution is short, and it is characterized by low values of the studied parameters. Other trajectories of succession: a long delay in the grass stage or skipping the meadow stage and transition from grass to tree-shrub stage, are also possible. The species diversity of communities is more conservative compared with the total projective coverage of species, the rate of development of which is largely determined by the successional age of the community than by the type of substrate.",serial grass communities; restoration succession; succession trajectory; projective cover; species saturation; deposits; industrial dumps; heavy metals,2022,53,4,10.1134/S1067413622040087,1067-4136,17,125,168,1104,8,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Effect of Background Color on the Coloration of Juvenile Giant Freshwater Prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii,"The influence of the color and brightness of the surroundings on the body coloration was studied for juveniles of giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. In the first experiment, prawns were kept for 10 days in containers with white, gray, black, green, blue, and red backgrounds; in the second, for 30 days in containers with red, gray, and blue backgrounds. The color indices at the end of the experiments were evaluated for abdomen, branchiostegites, and rostrum in the CIELab color space. When the color of the background changed, the brightness component of color elements changed as well in juveniles of M. rosenbergii. This effect was most pronounced against a black background. The chromatic indices of coloration also changed, indicating involvement of the prawn's color vision in the regulation of body coloration. The change in the chromatic indices of body coloration was less pronounced, and the changes were statistically significant only in a longer experiment.",camouflage; coloration change; cryptic coloration; disruptive coloration; Macrobrachium rosenbergii,2022,53,1,10.1134/S1067413622010039,1067-4136,14,105,153,986,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Effect of Environmental Factors on the Spatial Diversity Distribution Patterns of Lycophytes and Ferns in Northeast China,"Lycophytes and ferns are the oldest terrestrial vascular plants, sensitive to climate change, and can act as an indicator of environmental change in the forest. However, knowledge about the way in which environmental factors influence diversity distribution of lycophytes and ferns in Northeast China still remains limited. Based on the latest PPGI classification, this study has taken lycophytes and ferns in Northeast China as the research object. Using county distribution information and environmental factor data, combining stepwise multiple regression (SMR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR), species diversity and environmental origin of lycophytes and ferns in Northeast China have been discussed. The results have shown that areas of high species diversity of lycophytes and ferns in Northeast China have mainly been concentrated in Changbai Mountains, Da Hinggan Mountains and Xiao Hinggan Mountains, and Changbai Mountains have been the most abundant. Precipitation of wettest quarter (Bio16), elevation range (ER), and forest area (FA) have been the three key environmental factors affecting the species diversity distribution. Bio16, as the most important factor, can further reveal the influence of special life history characteristics of lycophytes and ferns on species diversity.

RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"Effects of Different Litter Treatments on Seed Germination and Seedling Growth of Pinus densata in Southeast Tibet, China","The aim of this study is to explore the effects of the litter cover thickness and cleaning methods on seed germination and seedling growth of Pinus densata. The overall goals are to provide a reference for the cultivation of seeds and seedlings of P. densata in Tibet and to establish a theoretical basis for the sustainable development and utilization of P. densata. Five typical P. densata forest plots have been set up in Nyingchi City, Tibet, and their litter and cones have been collected in the plots. Experiment 1 has set 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 cm as different litter cover thickness treatments. Each thickness level has been used three times, and the seed germination and seedling growth have been recorded for each. Experiment 2 has been site preparation treatments in the sample plots: no removal of shrubs and litter, removal of herbs and litter, removal of shrubs and litter, removal of shrubs and herbs, and removal of shrubs, herbs, and litter. Each treatment has been repeated three times, and the survival rate of the seeds and the growth of the seedlings have been recorded in each case. The results have shown the following. Litter cover thickness and the interaction between the cover and the seeds have had significant effects on the survival rate and germination potential of P. densata seedlings. The lesser the litter cover, the higher the seedling survival rate has been, meaning there is a negative correlation. The root length and stem length of P. densata seedlings has first increased and then decreased with the increase of litter coating thickness. The needle length of P. densata seedlings has been relatively stable, and basically has not varied with changes in litter thickness. On the other hand, root, stem, and leaf biomass and total biomass of P. densata seedlings have varied significantly with changes in litter cover thickness. The biomass has first increased and then decreased with the increase of litter thickness. There have been significant differences in the survival rate of P. densata seeds under different cleaning methods, and the survival rate of P. densata seeds has been the lowest under the A treatment. The preserved shrubs have had the greatest impact on the survival rate of P. densata seeds and had a strong promoting effect. The root length of P. densata seedlings has reached its longest under the B treatment, and the values range has been the largest. The basal diameter of seedlings has shown a gradual downward trend moving from the A treatment to the E treatment.

RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Effects of Water Extracts from the Leaves of Boxelder Maple Acer negundo and Native Tree Species on the Early Development of Plants,"The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that Acer negundo, an alien (invasive) tree species in Eurasia, has allelopathic activity. Using the method of roll culture, two experiments were performed to estimate the effect of water extracts from summer (green) and autumn (colored) leaves of A. negundo, compared to native woody species Sorbus aucuparia, Prunus padus, and Salix caprea, on the early development of Festuca rubra, Sinapis alba, and Trifolium repens. The results failed to prove conclusively that A. negundo leaf extract affects the early development of test plants: its effect was similarly strong as those of extracts from the leaves of native P. padus and S. caprea, while the leaf extract of the native shrub S. aucuparia proved to have a distinct inhibitory effect. On the whole, no evidence was obtained that allelopathic influences of compounds leached from A. negundo leaves may be the actual mechanism accounting for the ecological success of this species in its secondary range.",invasive plants; mechanisms of invasiveness; novel weapons hypothesis; allelopathy; plant test systems; roll culture,2022,53,2,10.1134/S1067413622020084,1067-4136,22,131,162,1011,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,Impact of the Development of Hydrocarbon Deposits on Water Ecosystems of the Yamal Peninsula,"Data of monitoring studies (2014-2016) on the state of hydrobionts in watercourses during the development of a hydrocarbon deposit on the Yamal Peninsula have been analyzed. The increased content of suspended solids has the greatest effect on hydrobionts. While the background values of concentration of suspended solids is 4-6 mg/L, in the area of the entrance of the pit effluents to the watercourses, their concentration increases up to 440 mg/L and higher. The effect of increased turbidity on the qualitative and quantitative indicators of planktonic organisms has not been found. An increase of suspended solids in water has a negative effect on zoobenthos (r(Sp) = -0.426, p = 0.030 for the number of species; r(Sp) = -0.590, p = 0.002 for the abundance; r(Sp) = -0.480, p = 0.013 for the biomass) and fish (r(Sp) = -0.567, p = 0.004 for ecological density of small fish species). Especially sensitive fish to the increased content of suspended solids are whitefishes and lake minnows. The most tolerant to turbidity are the nine-spined stickleback and Barbatula toni.

The species specificity of the accumulation of the considered elements in the liver was determined by the composition of diets and was expressed in increased accumulation of Cu and Cd in the liver of S. araneus and increased accumulation of Pb in the liver of S. caecutiens. A multiple reduction in industrial emissions did not lead to an equivalent decrease in the content of heavy metals (HMs) either in the feed or in the body of shrews. Over 30 years, directed changes in HM concentrations in the liver were noted only in S. caecutiens: in the impact zone (1-3 km from the plant), the content of Zn did not change, the concentrations of Cd and Pb decreased by 1.2-1.5 times, while the concentration of Cu, on the contrary, increased by 1.5 times. In the buffer zone (4-10 km) Cu, Zn, and Pb concentrations remain unchanged, while the concentrations of Cd decreased by 1.5 times; in the background area (20-34 km), the content of essential elements (Cu, Zn) was maintained at the same level, while the concentration of toxic elements (Cd and Pb) decreased by 4-5 times.",industrial pollution; natural ecosystem restoration; copper; zinc; cadmium; lead; liver; food spectrum; Sorex araneus; S; caecutiens; S; minutus; S; isodon,2022,53,5,10.1134/S1067413622050095,1067-4136,25,157,276,1627,15,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes

A gradient of Coriaria abundance (level 1-4) has been established and the sites have been arranged in order of increasing abundance of Coriaria. In this study, compared to the lowest abundance level, the tree species richness increased by 43\% and the shrub species richness increased by 25\% at the highest abundance level of Coriaria, indicating that the effects of Coriaria have been consistent and strongly positive on the species richness. The tree and the shrub density have also been increased along with increasing abundance of Coriaria while the tree and the shrub basal area have been decreased. The population structure and the regeneration status have suggested that regeneration of tree species has been facilitated by Coriaria in low abundance sites and inhibited in high abundance sites.

However, the spatial distribution and the activity-density of termites on a fine-scale in tropical forests are still unknown. We checked the spatial distribution patterns of the feeding groups and species of termites and their co-occurrence pattern in a 1-ha (100 m x 100 m) plot, and their correlation with the environmental factors. We used a standard protocol to collect termite assemblages and classified them into five feeding groups based on their preferred diet: fungus growers, litter feeders, soil feeders, soil-wood feeders, and wood feeders. We measured the environmental factors: soil pH, litter mass, aboveground plant biomass, and topographic position index (TPI). Soil-wood feeders showed the highest activity-density, followed by wood feeders, fungus growers, soil feeders, and litter feeders. Soil-wood feeders and fungus growers demonstated a strong correlation while litter feeders showed weak correlations with other feeding groups. Termite feeding groups and most of the termite species displayed a positive association with the high TPI and the low soil pH patches. Our results indicated that the examined environmental factors influenced the termite community assemblages and distribution patterns on a fine-scale in tropical rainforests.

However, at present, little is known about the impact of residual chlorine on the soil micro-ecological environment. Herein, we treated an experimental soil-plant-microbiome microcosm system by continuous irrigation with a low concentration of chlorine-containing water, and then analyzed the influence on the soil microbial community using metagenomics. After 14-d continuous chlorine treatment, there were no significant lasting effect on soil microbial community diversity and composition either in the rhizosphere or in bulk soil. Although metabolic functions of the rhizosphere microbial community were affected slightly by continuous chlorine treatment, it recovered to the original status. The abundance of several resistance genes changed by 7 d and recovered by 14 d. According to our results, the chlorine residue resulting from daily disinfection may present a slight long-term effect on plant growth (shoot length and fresh weight) and soil micro-ecology.

SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS,Changes of microbiome in response to sugars in a wilt pathogen-infested soil,"Sugars are frequently and abundantly found in root exudates, but influence of specific sugars on the fate of soil-borne pathogens, microbiome structure, and particularly microbial interactions are not well understood. A 42-day of microcosm incubation was conducted with two soils: a natural watermelon Fusarium wilt pathogen (i.e., Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON))-infested soil (Low-FON soil) and the soil further receiving the wilt pathogen inocula (High-FON soil). Both soils were supplemented with four simple sugars before incubation. The results show that, in both soils, FON was enriched by all sugars although co-living with tremendously diverse microbes; and bacterial richness, evenness, and diversity were decreased and bacterial community structure was changed by all sugars. Bacterial richness and evenness were negatively correlated with FON quantity in both Low-FON and High-FON soils, indicating that FON may tend to live in soil with low alpha-diversity. In both Low-FON and High-FON soils, the sugar-spiked networks had more links, higher density, larger modules, and shorter harmonic geodesic distance, suggesting greater potentials for microbial interaction and niche-sharing. The positive links between some of the keystone taxa and FON indicates that these keystone taxa may have promoted FON. This may be one of reasons why FON could proliferate vigorously after sugar supplementation.

However, the annotation difference of commonly used primers and reference databases on nematode community is still unclear. We compared two pairs of primers (3NDf/C\_1132rmod, NF1F/18Sr2bR) and three databases (NT\_v20200604, SILVA138/18s Eukaryota and PR2\_v4.5 databases) on the determination of nematode community from four different vegetation types in Changbai Mountain, including mixed broadleaf-conifer forest, dark coniferous forest, betula ermanii Cham and alpine tundra. Our results showed that the selection of different primers and databases influenced the annotation of nematode taxa, but the diversity of nematode community showed consistent pattern among different vegetation types. Our findings emphasize that it is necessary to select appropriate primer and database according to the target taxonomic level. The difference in primers will affect the result of nematode taxa at different classification levels, so sequencing analysis cannot be used for comparison with studies using different primers. In terms of annotation effect in this study, 3NDf/C\_1132rmod primers with NT\_v20200604 database could provide more information than other combinations at the genus or species levels.

In this study, the cotton field in Xinjiang (China), which underwent film mulching for a prolonged period of 5-30 years, was selected as the research location. A total of 360 soil samples were collected, aiming to study the spatial distribution characteristics of mulching film debris pollution. The samples were extracted using the density flotation method combined with stereomicroscopic; the source, composition, abundance, and distribution characteristics of soil MPs were identified by the scanning electron microscopic, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analyses. In soil mulched for a 30 year period, the abundance of microplastics across the studied soil depth (0-60 cm) was 78.51 +/- 2.57 n/(100 g). The mu-FTIR analyses revealed that the composition of the microplastics matched that of polyethylene materials. Therefore, plastic mulching could be inferred as a major contributor to microplastic pollution in agricultural lands.

After 2-DE, 36 DEPs were found and 24 of them were successfully identified. 79.2\% of DEPs were upregulated compared to the control group. The maximum fold change reached 53.8 in spot 3108 in the 80 mg kg(-1) As group. Two proteins were not found in the control group but found in the As treated groups. Proteins were grouped into metabolism, signal transduction, stress-related, transport, regulation, and predicted/hypothetical protein categories based on their function. The protein-protein interaction between the DEPs indicated that serum albumin (ALB) is very important, related to 6 other proteins. Proteins were then verified by western blot, the results were in agreement with the proteomic analyses. The identification of induced or repressed proteins because of As3+ in earthworms is helpful to explore the underlying mechanisms of soil arsenic ecotoxicity.

SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS,Effects of fertilizer and weed species richness on soil nematode community in a microcosm field experiment,"Both fertilizer and plant species richness may affect the soil nematode community. However, the influence of fertilizer and weed species richness interaction is unclear. Nematode abundance and biodiversity in wheat and weed plots soil treated with nitrogen, phosphate and potassium fertilizer addition and weed species richness (0, 1, 2 and 4 weed levels) were investigated in a long-term microcosm experiment established in 2010 at Kaifeng, China. The results demonstrated that fertilizer treatment increased the abundance of total nematode, bacterivores, and plant parasites whereas it decreased the total genera number, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), Margalef richness index (SR), the total maturity index (Sigma MI), and structure index (SI), and degraded the structure of the nematode community. In contrast, weed species richness increased these ecological indices and enhanced the structure of the nematode community. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the fertilizer's effect was more significant than weed species richness. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that fertilizer affected soil nematode mainly through increasing soil available phosphorus by 4.71 times and ammonium nitrogen content by 74.03\%; weed species richness increased the diversity indices of soil nematode mainly through enhancing soil moisture by 2.07\%. Our results suggest weed species richness may relieve the negative effect of fertilizer on the diversity of soil nematode community.

SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS,Effects of lead pollution on soil microbial community diversity and biomass and on invertase activity,"Lead (Pb) pollution is one of the most widespread and harmful environmental problems worldwide. Determination of changes in soil properties and microbial functional diversity due to land use is needed to establish a basis for remediation of soil pollution. This study aimed to investigate soils contaminated by Pb from different sources and to analyze the functional diversity and metabolism of soil microbial communities using Biolog technology. Pb pollution (> 300 mg kg(-1)) significantly influenced the diversity and metabolic functions of soil microbial communities. Specifically, Pb contamination significantly reduced soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) levels and catalase activity while increasing invertase activity. Furthermore, Biolog EcoPlate assays revealed that Pb pollution reduced the general activities of soil microorganisms, suppressing their ability to utilize C sources. In Pb-contaminated areas lacking vegetation cover, Shannon, Simpson, and McIntosh diversity indices of soil microorganisms were significantly reduced. The microbial diversity and biomass C and N levels were affected by land use and soil properties, respectively, whereas soil enzyme activity was primarily affected by the interaction between land use and soil properties. Our results provide a reference and a theoretical basis for developing soil quality evaluation and remediation strategies.

SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS,Effects of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on soil structure and function,"Soils are impacted globally by several anthropogenic factors, including chemical pollutants. Among those, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of concern due to their high environmental persistence, and as they might affect soil structure and function. However, data on impacts of PFAS on soil structure and microbially-driven processes are currently lacking. This study explored the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) at environmental-relevant concentrations on soil health, using a 6-week microcosm experiment. PFAS (even at 0.5 ng g(-1) for PFBS) significantly increased litter decomposition, associated with positive effects on beta-glucosidase activities. This effect increased with PFAS concentrations. Soil pH was significantly increased, likely as a direct consequence of increased litter decomposition affected by PFAS. Soil respiration was significantly inhibited by PFAS in week 3, while this effect was more variable in week 6. Water-stable aggregates were negatively affected by PFOS, possibly related to microbial shifts. PFAS affected soil bacterial and fungal abundance, but not microbial and certain enzyme activities. Our work highlights the potential effects of PFAS on soil health, and we argue that this substance class could be a factor of environmental change of potentially broad relevance in terrestrial ecosystem functioning.

SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS,Global-scale analysis reveals distinct patterns of non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide synthase encoding genes in root and soil bacterial communities,"Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by soil bacteria, for instance antimicrobials and siderophores, play a vital role in bacterial adaptation to soil and root ecosystems and can contribute to plant health. Many SMs are non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides, assembled by non-ribosomal peptides synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) and encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Despite their ecological importance, little is known about the occurrence and diversity of NRPs and PKs in soil. We extracted NRPS- and PKS-encoding BGCs from 20 publicly available soil and root-associated metagenomes and annotated them using antiSMASH-DB. We found that the overall abundance of NRPSs and PKSs is similar in both environments, however NRPSs and PKSs were significantly clustered between soil and root samples. Moreover, the majority of identified sequences were unique to either soil- or root-associated datasets and had low identity to known BGCs, suggesting their novelty. Overall, this study illuminates the huge untapped diversity of predicted SMs in soil and root microbiomes, and indicates presence of specific SMs, which may play a role in inter- and intra-bacterial interactions in root ecosystems.

SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS,Influence of cadmium and copper mixtures to rhizosphere bacterial communities,"To study the effects of combined Cd and Cu pollution on rhizosphere bacterial community. High-throughput sequencing was used to examine the response of rhizosphere bacterial communities to heavy-metal stress under single and mixed pollution of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu). With additions of Cd and Cu, the mean diversity index of rhizosphere bacterial community was in the order Cu alone > Cd-Cu mixtures> Cd alone. In all Cd and Cu treatments, the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria. In the additions with different concentrations of Cd-Cu mixtures, LEfSe indicated that there were differences in the predominant species of rhizosphere bacterial communities. Some genera such as Streptomyces and Microbacterium belonging to Actinobacteria as biomarkers were significantly enriched in both control and treatments, while some genera such as Pseudoxanthomonas and Rhodopseudomonas belonging to Proteobacteria as biomarkers were observed to be enriched in the additions with single and mixture of Cd and Cu. According to the Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis, the structure of rhizosphere bacterial community was different between treatments and the CK. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) showed that there were significant differences among treatments (p < 0.01), and that the addition of Cu might be the primary factor affecting the composition of rhizosphere bacterial communities.

SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS,Use of flue gas desulfurization gypsum to reduce dissolved phosphorus in runoff and leachate from two agricultural soils,"Controlling dissolved phosphorus (DP) loss from high P soil to avoid water eutrophication is a worldwide high priority. A greenhouse study was conducted in which flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FGDG) was applied by using different application methods and rates to two agricultural soils. Phosphorus fertilizer was incorporated into the soils at 2.95 g kg(-1) to simulate soil with high P levels. The FGDG was then applied at amounts of 0, 1.5, and 15 g kg(-1) soil on either the soil surface or mixed throughout the soil samples to simulate no-tillage and tillage, respectively. Ryegrass was planted after treatment application. The study showed that FGDG reduced runoff DP loss by 33\% and leachate DP loss 38\% in silt loam soil, and runoff DP loss 46\% and leachate DP loss 14\% in clay loam soil, at the treatment of 15 g kg(-1) FGDG. Mixing applied method (tillage) provided strong interaction with higher FGDG. To overall effect, the mixing-applied method performed better in controlling DP loss from silt loam soil, while surface-applied (no tillage) showed its advantage in controlling DP loss from clay loam soil. In practice it is necessary to optimize FGDG concentrations, application methods, and DP sources (runoff or leachate) to get maximized benefits of FGDG application. The FGDG application had no negative effects on the soil and ryegrass.

SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS,Biological transfer of silver under silver nanoparticle exposure and nitrogen transfer via a collembolan-predatory mite food-chain and ecotoxicity of silver sulfide,"The development of nanotechnology has accelerated the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in household chemicals and the accumulation of Ag in sewage treatment systems. The application of sewage sludge products to soils raises concerns over the safety of Ag in the function and biogeochemical cycles of the soil belowground ecosystem. Here, we assess the potential risk of the accumulation and transfer of Ag under AgNPs exposure and its effects on the trophic transfer of nitrogen (N) through a soil animal food chain (Folsomia candida-Hypoaspis aculeifer). The formation of stable silver sulfide (Ag2S) was also studied via a single species test using F. candida. Concentrations of Ag in F. candida increased with increasing AgNPs concentration, as did those in the predator H. aculeifer, but the Ag bioaccumulation factors of both animals were < 1. Folsomia candida body tissue N-15 abundance declined markedly compared with that of H. aculeifer. Silver sulfide did have adverse effects on the survival and reproduction of F. candida. The Ag concentrations of F. candida increased with increasing Ag2S concentration in sludge-treated soils. Silver sulfide showed ecotoxicity to the collembolan, therefore ecotoxicity resulting from the transformation and fate of AgNPs in soils needs to be considered before biosolid products are applied to agricultural soils.

SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,Age structure and condition assessment of Fagus orientalis Lipsky in the Caucasian Ecoregion,"Aim. To determine the age structure and assess the current state of Fagus orientalis Lipsky in the Caucasian Ecoregion. Material and Methods. The material was collected in beech forests in different floristic districts of the Caucasian Ecoregion. The registration of individual specimens was carried out on 121 test sites, with a total area of 73925 m2. A total of 19936 individuals of Fagus orientalis were involved in the analysis. Each individual was assessed by condition and assigned to a certain age group. Results. The study of the age structure of Fagus orientalis in the beech forests of the Caucasian Ecoregion showed a similar pattern of distribution of age group participation in all the studied areas studied. The age spectra revealed are left-sided and full-membered where individuals of the pre -generative phase predominate. For all populations, in general, almost the same share of the contribution of individuals of germinal and virginal age groups was noted, amounting to about 50\% in total. On average, there are 2906 individuals per 1 ha, of which 459 have reached the generative phase. The condition of individuals of the pre-generative and generative phases across all the botanical areas of the Caucasian Ecoregion studied was estimated by us at 1.47 points. Conclusions. The study of the age structure of populations and the assessment of the condition of individuals allows us to assess the influence of certain abiotic and biotic factors. Low values of the proportion of post -generative individuals are the result of anthropogenic load in easily accessible territories. Under the influence of processes of intra-and interspecific competition, the share of participation of virginal and post -generative groups increases and is especially clearly observed in beech elfin-woodlands.",Key Caucasus; floristic districts; Fagus orientalis; structure; population; age group; condition assessment,2022,17,2,10.18470/1992-1098-2022-2-52-61,1992-1098,13,92,280,1809,7,16,200,10,Yes,225,175,yes,no,yes
SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,An assessment of landscape-ecological stability in agricultural regions of Ural and West Siberia,"Aim. An assessment and cartographical analysis of landscape-ecological stability in agricultural regions of Ural and West Siberia, subjects of Asian Russia, using eight steppe areas as an example. Material and Methods. An assessment of landscape-ecological stability through calculating the coefficient of the ecological stability of a landscape on the base of the conjugate analysis of 13 indicators grouped into two blocks - stable and unstable landscape components. Monitoring of the state of an agricultural area using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of crops on the base of Earth remote sensing. Results. Specific territorial features and inter-regional relations were determined according to separate landscape components. A schematic map reflecting the state of ecological stability was formulated; it was shown that this rises the more easterly the location. Conclusion. The Tyumen region is distinguished by clearly expressed ecological stability, which is also well expressed in the Novosibirsk region. Most other regions are characterized by a conditionally stable state. The Orenburg region's landscapes are in an unstable state. Arable lands are characterized by the most instability among unstable components of a landscape. The coefficient of landscape ecological stability (CESL) is tightly connected with the proportion of tillage in a region's total area. It rises with the reduction of a tillage area in 74\% of cases studied. Withdrawal from cultivation of unstable and degraded lands during the intensification of agriculture in highly fertile areas and transfer to fodder lands (including protected areas), which contribute to an increase in the proportion of stable landscape elements, can be considered as the main direction for increasing their stability and preserving biological diversity.",Landscape-ecological stability; coefficient of ecological stability; agricultural regions of Ural and West Siberia; steppe regions of the Asian part of Russia,2022,17,1,10.18470/1992-1098-2022-1-109-118,1992-1098,13,96,266,1834,4,16,200,10,Yes,225,175,yes,no,yes

The study of some biological features of the potentially dangerous for the south of Russia species of Metcalfa or citrus flaccid planthopper (Metcalfa pruinosa (Say, 1830) (Homoptera, Flatidae) and the possibility of regulating its abundance with low-hazard pesticides (hazard class 3-4): actara, phytoverm and the biopreparation, bitoxibacillin. Material and Methods. Metcalfa's monitoring was carried out on trees and shrubs in the city of Krasnodar and its environs in various zones of anthropogenic load in 2018-2021. Results. An initial assessment of the effectiveness of pesticides was carried out, as well as the identification of possible sites of the presence of Metcalfa and the study of phenology. The hatching of larvae of this species occurs in spring from late April to June, one generation per year. However, in late August - early October, larvae of younger ages were found, which indicates the development of a second incomplete generation and confirms the literature data on a possible increase in the number of planthopper generations in new areas. Joint colonies of Metcalfa with lace beetles were also noted. Monitoring was carried out using light traps based on superbright LEDs. Conclusion. Based on the results of route surveys in our studies, plants from the Rosaceae family turned out to be the most attractive for planthoppers, which accounted for about 25\% of the recorded species. At the peak of flight, the catchability of light traps in our experiments was up to 210. As a result of testing preparations on larvae of younger ages, treatment with Aktara (2 l/ha) showed 100\% efficiency; 92-85\% - Fitoverm (1 l/ha) and 83-78\% Bitoxibacillin (4 l/ha).",Garden agroecosystem; invasive species; monitoring; phytophage; Metcalfa,2022,17,1,10.18470/1992-1098-2022-1-36-48,1992-1098,25,172,266,1688,5,16,200,10,Yes,225,175,yes,no,yes

To identify land and water areas for inclusion in the regional ecological framework of Sevastopol City and to define the core areas for ensuring the representative character of the nature protection network and the ecological stability of the region.Material and Methods. Based on field surveys, archival and published data, the structure of the ecological framework of Sevastopol was specified as a part of the Crimean ecological network, developed in 2008. A schematic map of the protected areas and ecological framework elements was developed and calculation of their area carried out using the QGIS-3.10.10. The index of environmental significance was calculated according to Guryevskikh and a scale for its gradation was suggested. For ecological centres and corridors, the ratio of key areas of the first and second order was analyzed.Results. The creation of 34 protected areas was proposed and their conservation value was shown. The boundaries of the core areas and 11 structural elements of the ecological framework were specified, its representativeness was characterized and problems of its implementation were discussed. As a result of optimization of the nature protection network of Sevastopol, the share of the protected areas and ecological framework of the total area of the city will be increased to 37.1 and 66\%, respectively. A complex of conservational measures has been proposed for the protection of populations and biotopes of rare species included in the Red Data Book of Sevastopol.Conclusions. The creation of new core areas and the optimisation of the nature conservation network will ensure the maintenance of the sustainability of the ecological framework and the ecological stability of the region but will not make significant changes to the previously formed disproportion due to the impossibility of creating large objects with a high category of protection.

To identify the distribution features of a key species of macrophytobenthos in the shallow water zone of Karkinitskiy Bay.Material and Methods. The field materials from a comprehensive expedition carried out during the summer 2019 were collected and processed by the authors. Results. For the first time, a map was compiled and the features of the distribution of dominant types of macrophytobentos identified in the shallow water zone of Karkinitskiy Bay.Conclusion. It was shown that in the eastern part of the bay, on a shallow slope composed of silty-sandy deposits, adjacent to the accumulative shores, sea grasses dominate and along the abrasive-clay shores there is no bottom vegetation and significant accumulations of dead leaves of Zostera marina i Z. noltei are typical there. In the water area of the Bakal spit macrophitobentos is not found on the sandy deposits. Cladophora spp. are represented in the base of the western branch of the spit, at the place of its joining an active clayey cliff.

To carry out an ecological and faunistic review of weevils of the tribe Baridini Schoencherr, 1836 of Dagestan; study of the ecology and chorology of the most harmful species, the green rutabaga baride (Aulacobaris coerulescens Scop.). Material and Methods. The work was based on observations and materials obtained in 1996-2020 in various regions of Dagestan, using classical methods of field study of invertebrates. Collection materials and data from different authors for the period from 1872 to 2010 were also used. Stationary studies of the ecology of Aulacobaris coerulescens Scopoli, 1763 were conducted on the basis of agricultural cooperatives and peasant farms of Buynaksky, Levashinsky, Akushinsky and Gergebilsky districts of Dagestan. Results. Studies have shown that the fauna of the tribe Baridini in Dagestan is represented by 26 species from 8 genera. In zoogeographic terms, it is composed of 7 complexes with the main core being formed by steppe species. In the attitudinal range, the fauna of lowland Dagestan is the richest, where 20 species live. Trophic specialization is dominated by broad oligophages; the main food base is the Brassicaceae family. The most important agricultural species and dangerous pest of cabbage in Dagestan is the green rutabaga baride (Aulacoboris coerulescens Scopoli, 1763).

Samples of D. awaricus seeds collected in natural populations along the altitudinal ecocline from 820 to 1,720 m above sea level served as the material for the study. To study the field germination and growth dynamics of the plants, D. awaricus seeds were sown at two experimental bases of the Mountain Botanical Garden (at 1,100 and 1,750 m above sea level). Evaluation of laboratory germination was carried out using seeds collected at the Tsudakhar base.Results. Comparative characteristics of the average values of the shoot length and the number of lateral branches of the studied samples showed that the differences between the populations are significant. The monthly increase in D. awaricus plants of different accessions also differs. Monthly variability of the shoot length of D. awaricus in the tested accessions is at a high level, the expressivity of which, apparently, is significantly affected by a complex of environmental factors. A study of the germination of D. awaricus seeds showed that it is higher under laboratory conditions than under experimental field conditions. The highest percentage of seed germination was observed in the ``Gunib{''} sample: 64.0\% in the laboratory and 28.6\% in the field at the Tsudakhar base.Conclusions. Differences were noted in growth dynamics in the studied samples of D. awaricus studied, apparently due to a complex of abiotic and biotic environmental factors. For the ``Tsudakhar{''} samples the experimental conditions and place of collection of seed material were identical but for the other two samples they were different from their natural habitat.

The objective of this research was to establish the reasons for productivity reduction and changes in the species and quantitative composition of phytocenoses of multiple-aged fallows and to develop methods for their use optimisation. Material and Methods. The research was conducted as a stationary field experiment. The fallow was formed since 2004 on the site of a field crop rotation. Fallow soil was moderately and heavily washed black earth. Results. It was established that the availability of soil with plant nutrients in all experimental variants did not differ much during the entire period of research. The bases for changes in the fallow productivity were not chemical but rather physical soil processes. During the first three years of the fallow formation, the soil became more firm. The unit weight of the arable layer reached 1.48 g/cm(3), hardness reached 24.4 kg/cm(2) and water permeability reached 59 mm/hour. The soil's ability to recover its initial parameters began after 7-10 years and after 30 years of fallow formation, the soil firmness was the same as in the steppe area, the unit soil weight acquired an equilibrium state, and the water permeability of the soil became optimal. Conclusion. In the first 3-4 years after the assignment of an area for fallow, it is optimal to mow plants twice or three times before their seeding, using mowed biomass for green manure or composting.

SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,In-depth adaptation of winter wheat cultivation technology in the Central Chernozem region,"Aim. The purpose of the research is to determine the method of soil cultivation and the dose of NPK, based on in-depth adaptation of winter wheat cultivation technology, ensuring the minimum cost of producing grain of the crop of the required quality in the Central Black Earth Region (CBER). Materials and Methods. The efficiency of winter wheat production largely depends on the adaptation of the technology of its cultivation to soil and climatic conditions, which are identified at the level of the agroecological province. But the main object of farming systems - the soil cover within the agroecological province is distinguished by a high territorial diversity in fertility, which is not taken into account when developing agricultural technologies and thus lowers the level of their adaptability. Therefore, it is proposed to minimize the use of resources in intensive technologies due to in-depth adaptation of tillage and fertilization in accordance with the initial state of the soil of a particular field. Results. It was found that for the conditions of the CBER, the optimal values of the factors are the dose N19P39K39 and the combined method of tillage for winter wheat, which correspond to the minimum cost of grain of 5.38 thousand roubles/t with a yield of 3.38 t/ha and a 12\% protein content in grain of 3rd class. Conclusion. In addressing agricultural problems when there is an interaction between the factors, the effectiveness of in-depth adaptation increases with the complex optimisation of factors according to innovative methodology using the mathematical method of indefinite Lagrange multipliers. Comprehensive optimisation of the factors made it possible to determine the method of tillage and the dose of fertiliser that would ensure the minimum cost of producing grain of a given quality under the conditions of the CBER.",In-depth adaptation; winter wheat; tillage; mineral fertilisation; optimisation of factors,2022,17,1,10.18470/1992-1098-2022-1-119-127,1992-1098,12,90,293,1855,5,16,200,10,Yes,225,175,yes,no,yes
SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,Influence of agrometeorological climate changes on grain productivity of spring barley in the Non-chernozem zone of the Russian Federation,"Aim. To study the influence of weather conditions on the formation of the spring barley crop under prevailing climatic changes. Material and Methods. The object of research was varieties and lines of spring barley of the FITZ Nemchinovka selection, which were studied annually in 2001-2020 in a competitive test in the conditions of the Moscow region. According to the meteorological data for the FITZ Nemchinovka, the average monthly indicators of precipitation, air temperature and GTCM were calculated. Mathematical processing of yield data was undertaken on a computer using the Excel programme. Results. A significant increase in the average monthly air temperature during the spring-summer season, an increase in the amount of precipitation in May and a decrease in other months of the growing season indicate a change in the climatic conditions of the region. In favorable years, with a GTCM value from 1.32 to 2.34, the average yield of barley was 5.88 t/ha and in dry years with GTCM values from 0.48 to 1.26 - 3.28 t/ha. in the spring-summer period, there was a relatively stable variability in yield from the dynamics of precipitation and GTCM (r= 0.346...0.572). The negative correlation dependence of the yield of varieties on the average monthly air temperature throughout the season had a relatively unstable character and manifested itself as very weak or medium (r=-0.021...-0.372). Conclusion. The positive yield trend observed in the conditions of the Moscow region with the annual use of the same agricultural machinery is due to an increase in the adaptive potential of new varieties and breeding lines of FITZ Nemchinovka.",Moscow region; spring barley; yield; hydrothermal conditions; statistical analysis,2022,17,1,10.18470/1992-1098-2022-1-128-135,1992-1098,19,138,260,1644,5,16,200,10,Yes,225,175,yes,no,yes
SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,"Influence of weather and climatic conditions on the genetic and physiological system of winter wheat plants in arid conditions of the Central Caucasus, Russia","Aim. In the arid zone of the Central Caucasus it is especially important to grow crops with a high adaptive capacity to changing weather and climatic conditions. In this regard, the purpose of this research work was to determine the influence of hydrothermal factors of the region on the pigment complex and the ability of plants to accumulate nitrogen, protein content in grain and productivity of various varieties of winter wheat. Material and Methods. In the experiment, statistical and mathematical methods were used comprehensively to determine the influence of weather and climatic factors of the region on the pigment complex, the ability of plants to accumulate nitrogen, grain quality and yield of 3 varieties of winter wheat (Zustrich, Bagheera and Bagrat). Results. With the aid of statistical and mathematical analysis, the spectrum of changes in the individual reaction of genotypes of various varieties of winter wheat (according to chlorophyll, carotenoids, nitrogen content in plants, grain quality {[}protein content) and productivity) in arid conditions of the region was revealed. As a result of the research, it was found that the Bagrat variety optimally realizes its potential to neutralize the negative impact of external environmental factors. The remaining varieties in the agrocenoses of the region had average indicators. Conclusion. The varietal reaction of winter wheat to the phases of plant vegetation was been established.

SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,Soil processes in sandy podzols under conditions of variations in climatic parameters of the forest steppe of the Central Russian province,"Aim. The aim of the research was to identify the influence of the climate factor on the soil processes in sandy podzols in the forest steppe of the Central Russian province. Material and Methods. Traditional methods (soil survey method, profile method, microbiological methods, etc.) and the latest methods (direct measurements {[}in situ] of soil CO2 emission) of investigation were used. Results. It has been established that soil formation processes in azonal Al-Fe-humus sandy soils are reflexive to variations in climatic parameters of the forest steppe zone. In warmer and arid conditions of the forest-steppe (southern part), sandy sod-podzols are formed, in colder and humid conditions of the forest-steppe (northern part) - sandy podzols. The soddy-podzols of the southern part of the foreststeppe can be characterized by a more humour soil profile, the content of which is 19.2\% higher than in the sandy podzols. More over sodpodzols have greater availability of mineral nutrition elements for plants and a higher microbiological activity (the number of bacteria is 12.7 times higher, micromycetes - 10.5 times, actinomycetes - 4.5 times) than sandy podzols. In summer, the rate of CO2 emission in Al-Fe-humus sandy soils in the northern part of the forest-steppe zone reached 9.1 g CO2 m(2)/day, in the southern part - 12.5 g CO2 m(2)/day. Conclusion.

SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,Specific features of accumulation of heavy metals in the body of mollusks (Molluska: Limacidae) of the southern slope of the Aragats mountain range,"Aim. The aim of this work is the study of the specifics of accumulation of heavy metals in the body of gastropod mollusks -slugs (Molluska: Limacidae) on the southern slope of the Aragats mountain range, namely, conducting a quantitative analysis of heavy metals in the soil of different points of the Aragats mountain range and in the body of slugs (Vitrinoides monticola armeniaca; Deroceras caucasicum; Limax flavus), as well as the principles of biogenic migration of heavy metals according to the soil- plant-animal system (slugs) and determining the role of slugs in this migration in terrestrial ecosystems.Material and Methods. Slugs collected from different points of the southern slope of the Aragats mountain range served as material for this study. The content of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Ca, Mo) in the body of the mollusks was determined by the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry method: AAS extraction \& ISO-8288. The features of the biological accumulation of heavy metals in the body of mollusks were also determined.Results. Gastropod mollusks (Molluska: Limacidae) actively accumulate heavy metals (especially Cu, Zn, Ca) in their bodies and play a certain role in their transfer through food chains. Slugs, living in upper soil horizons (mesofauna) and under stones and plant litter, actively respond to the slightest changes in the environment and are perspective objects allowing the detection of deviations in the functioning of soils and the natural complex as a whole.Conclusion. Slugs living in the soil are an important link of the biogenic migration of heavy metals.

SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,Study of the toxic effect of trichothecene mycotoxin produced by Fusarium sporotrichioides in an experiment on pigs,"Aim. To assess the consequences of long-term consumption by pigs of feed experimentally contaminated with T-2 toxin in an amount dose to the most commonly found in feed. Material and Methods. The experiments were carried out on pigs, which were fed food contaminated with T-2 toxin in the amount of 200 mkg/kg for 45 days. During the experiment, the clinical condition of animals, feed and water consumption, the dynamics of live weight, analysis of blood parameters, the state of internal organs and tissues and statistical processing of the data obtained by conventional methods were undertaken. Results. Long-term consumption of feed contaminated with mycotoxin T-2 by pigs did not cause a pronounced clinical picture of toxicosis. However, the treated animals had diarrhea and lag in growth and development. According to the results of the blood test, it was concluded that the toxin suppressed the hematopoiesis process, inhibited protein synthesis, reduced resistance and microphagocytic function of the body, metabolic disorders and the functioning of most organs and systems. Pathological conditions and degenerative changes of cells and tissues of internal organs were recorded and mediated by the initiation of oxidative stress, inflammatory processes and cytotoxic effect. Conclusions. The consumption of feed contaminated with T-2 toxin in a dose of 200 mkg /kg by pigs was accompanied by disturbances of metabolic processes, functions of organs and systems, manifested by a decrease in growth intensity, changes in the blood picture, activity of enzyme systems, induction of oxidative stress, immunosuppressive and inflammatory reactions and pathomorphological disorders.

To analyse the data on spreading and population of the common hamster in Western Siberia from the mid-20th to early 21st centuries and to determine the major predictors affecting these parameters.Material and Methods. Long-term data on species' population from the Zoomonitor Databank (Institute of Systematics and Ecology of Animals of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, ISEA SB RAS), populace survey data and field observations provided by scholars over recent years were used. The maximum entropy method was used to model the species' ecological niche and range based on 82 common hamster sighting spots in Western Siberia. 19 bioclimatic factors as well as various soil types were used.Results. The reduction of range and threefold decrease of common hamster population until the 90s of the last century and a local increase in the number of the population at the beginning of the 21st century were noted. The main causes of the population decline include extensive extermination through the procurement of common hamster fur skins and limiting the harm caused as well as agricultural area size dynamics. The bioclimatic correlations revealed of the distribution of the common hamster, considered together with models of climate changes, suggest the possibility of common hamster obsolescence in modern steppe areas and its according repopulation of the large river bottomlands to the north of the current range.Conclusion.

SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST,Changes in the Forest Bat Community After Arrival of White-Nose Syndrome in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas,"Populations of some cave-hibernating bats have undergone declines in recent years due to an introduced fungus (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) that causes the disease white-nose syndrome (WNS), which is often fatal to bats during hibernation. Unprecedented declines in cave-hibernating species have the potential to change community composition via numerous mechanisms, including competitive release. We trapped bats for 6 years in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas prior to the arrival of WNS in the region and compared capture rates of 7 species to capture rates collected in 2020-2021 after WNS establishment. We found a 98\% decline in Myotis septentrionalis (Northern Long-eared Bat) and a 77\% decline in Perimyotis subflavus (Tricolored Bat) after WNS became prevalent. Nycticeius humeralis (Evening Bat) captures increased by 220\% after WNS. Capture rates of Eptesicus fuscus (Big Brown Bat) increased by 100\%, but this increase was not significant. We also found no significant differences in captures rates for Lasiurus borealis (Eastern Red Bat), Lasiurus seminolus (Seminole Bat), and Lasiurus cinereus (Hoary Bat) after the arrival of WNS.

SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST,Comparison of the Relative Abundance of Potential Prey to the Diet of the Louisiana Pine Snake (Pituophis ruthveni),"Pituophis ruthveni (Louisiana Pine Snake) occurs in parts of western Louisiana and eastern Texas and was recently listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. It is considered a diet specialist because it mostly feeds upon Geomys breviceps (Baird's Pocket Gopher). which make up similar to 75\% of its estimated total prey biomass. Diet specialization is rare among vertebrates. One factor that can influence dietary diversity is the availability and abundance of prey items. To gain more insight on the Louisiana Pine Snake's diet, we sampled terrestrial and subterranean small mammals across 3 study sites within the range of this snake species in Louisiana to determine their relative abundance and availability. We compared these results to diet studies of the Louisiana Pine Snake to determine if any small mammal species were consumed more often than expected. The total of 59 small mammals captured consisted of Baird's Pocket Gopher, Sigmodon hispidus (Hispid Cotton Rat), Peromyscus spp. (deer mice), and Reithrodontomys spp. (harvest mice). Baird's Pocket Gopher had significantly higher relative abundances and biomass than terrestrial small mammals. When compared to proportions of actual consumed prey species, the Louisiana Pine Snake preyed upon Baird's Pocket Gopher significantly more than expected based on their availability in the environment. Finally, Chesson's prey selection index determined that the Louisiana Pine Snake positively selected Baird's Pocket Gopher, while the other species were either randomly or negatively selected.

This insectivorous bat is a species of conservation concern in Alabama and Georgia and was thought to be restricted to the Southern Coastal Plain and Southeastern Plains ecoregions. Based primarily on cave, transportation-structure, and mist-netting surveys, we documented occurrences of Southeastern Myotis in 14 Alabama and 20 Georgia counties outside and along the border of the accepted range, including in the Piedmont, Ridge and Valley, Interior Plateau, and Southwestern Appalachians ecoregions. We reviewed observations of bats year-round in both states, including pregnant and lactating females and winter hibernacula. Roosting sites included caves, culverts, bridges, and tree cavities. Combined, these observations provide strong evidence that the range of Southeastern Myotis should consist of all Alabama and Georgia except for the Blue Ridge ecoregion.

Records of low abundance and habitat alterations have resulted in the species' imperiled conservation status and being petitioned for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act. The objective of this study was to conduct seasonal surveys across the Paleback Darter's distribution to better characterize growth, spawning patterns, and mortality using the seasonal von Bertalanffy statistic with an optimized electronic length frequency analysis (ELEFAN), as well as assess sex ratios throughout a calendar year to better inform future conservation management decisions for the species. We established seasonal survey collection sites at 4 localities and sampled with a backpack electrofishing unit and dip nets from January 2016 to October 2017.

Growth and coarse spawning patterns, based on the seasonal von Bertalanffy statistic, were comparable between the populations, suggesting similar and stable environmental factors throughout the distribution. Lastly, there was evidence of multiple spawn events occurring during winter and late spring or early summer that has not been documented for this species, warranting additional research.

Serpentes (Bambuseae, Bambusoideae, Poaceae) Including Two New Species from South America","The Neotropical woody bamboo genus Chusquea consists of 193 currently described species ranging from central Mexico and the Caribbean to Chile and Argentina, primarily in montane habitats. The six previously described species of Chusquea subg. Chusquea sect. Serpentes are scandent in habit, with infravaginal branching, few subsidiary buds per complement, and foliage leaves that tend to be relatively large compared to those of other members of Chusquea s.s. A review of available material of Chusquea sect. Serpentes, found throughout montane forests from Mexico south to the central Andes in Peru, revealed at least two undescribed species. One of the new species, Chusquea recurvata, is native to Venezuelan montane forests and is distinguished from Chusquea serpens by having circular central buds, asymmetrical, acute inner foliage leaf ligules, and 6-12 foliage leaves per complement. The other new species, Chusquea acutigluma, has been found only in and around the Risaralda gorge in Colombia, and differs from all other known South American species of Chusquea sect. Serpentes by its broadly open paniculate synflorescences. This paper includes (re-)descriptions of all known species of Chusquea sect. Serpentes, along with detailed photographs of the two newly described species, and a vegetative morphological key to the eight species belonging to the section.

In Brazil, several morphotypes with similar ecological preferences to H. repens s. s. occur, which have made identification at the specific level challenging. In an associated article using molecular phylogenetic, morphometry, and population genetic analyses, we showed that the H. repens complex is polyphyletic and subdivided into three main distantly related clades. Four of the studied morphotypes are phylogenetically distant from H. repens s. s. and morphologically distinct from all other taxa in the complex. They are described here as H. bryophila, H. hygrophila, H. subrepens, and H. compluviosa.

Eriocaulon benedictum, found in the Tocantins River Basin and Plate River Basin has a vegetative morphology similar to Eriocaulon aquatile and E. modestum due to the submerged life form with submerged leaves and long scapes surpassing the water column, but differs from both by the presence of a submerged stem with spiral leaves (vs. a rhizome with rosulate leaves), obtrullate floral bracts (vs. oblong floral bracts in E. aquatile or obovate in E. modestum), and band shaped projections on the seeds (vs. post shaped projections on E. modestum or projections absent in E. aquatile). Eriocaulon naviculum, found in the Araguaia River Basin, an emergent species, has a floral morphology similar to E. altogibbosum and E. gibbosum due to the presence of gibbous sepals in the pistillate flowers, but differs from both by the grey trichomes on the leaf sheath (vs. translucent trichomes in the latter species), slightly sinuous scapes (vs. straight scapes in the latter species), membranous, gibbous swelling in the sepals of the pistillate flowers (vs. incrassate gibbous swelling in the latter species), and seeds without projections with a rough lumen (vs. seeds without projections with a smooth lumen in E. gibbosum or seeds with band-like projections in E. altogibbosum).

It is a caulescent rosette up to 5 m tall, with whitish-cinereous appearance, sessile leaves with elliptic laminae, cymose capitulescences with aphyllous unbranched portion and 3-5 capitula, 5-13 phyllaries, the external ones 17.4-26.0 nun long, 49-92 ray florets 13.0-18.4 mm long, and 162-347 disc florets 8.2-12.2 mm long. Espeletia saboyana is similar to E. incana, but with longer laminae, bigger foliar area, and fewer ray floret series. It is also similar to E. murilloi, but with longer ray tubes, ray paleae, disc corollas, disc styles, disc anther appendages, and disc paleae. In addition, E. saboyana is distributed allopatrically in regard to E. incana and E. murilloi. This species is informally proposed to be listed as IUCN Critically Endangered (CR), since it is restricted to a single population with extent of occurrence =1.83 km(2) and area of occupancy = 0.48 km(2). Besides, this population is severely fragmented into 40-50 demes, the largest one covering only 34,000 m(2). Most demes are found in humid soils and wetlands submitted to continuous habitat deterioration as water is drained for use in agriculture. Espeletia saboyana is rare or absent in these newly drained areas, which are either colonized by other species that thrive on drier soils or transformed into pastures for cattle grazing.

SYSTEMATIC BOTANY,"Evolution of Chromosome Number in Wild Onions (Allium, Amaryllidaceae)","Polyploidy has been shown to be a significant driver of diversification among land plants. In addition to whole-genome duplication, other common mechanisms of chromosome number evolution include increases by a multiple of 1.5 in chromosome number due to the fusion of gametes with different ploidy levels (demi-polyploidy), gains or losses of single chromosomes that alter the DNA content of an organism (aneuploidy), or chromosome fission or fusion (ascending dysploidy or descending dysploidy, respectively). Considering the high variability in chromosome number transitions across multiple clades within angiosperms and the ancient genome duplication events responsible for their diversity, more studies of large polyploid systems are necessary to close the gaps in understanding chromosomal evolution in polyploid plants. Allium L. (Amaryllidaceae) is an ideal candidate for polyploid research because it is a large clade that includes numerous natural populations of diploid and polyploid species. Species of Allium mainly occupy temperate climates in the Northern Hemisphere and include economically important ornamentals and cultivated crops such as leeks, garlic, chives, and onions. Here, we used a molecular phylogeny of Allium to examine chromosomal evolution with chromEvol v. 2.0 which uses likelihood-based methods for inferring the pattern of chromosome number change across a phylogeny. The best-fit model of chromosomal evolution indicated that chromosome transitions within Allium occurred through the constant gains and losses of single chromosomes as well as demi-polyploidization events, with the rate of chromosome gain events being approximately 2.5 to 4.5 times more likely to occur than demi-polyploidization and loss events, respectively.",dysploidy; molecular phylogeny; polyploidy,2022,47,2,10.1600/036364422X16512564801678,0363-6445,9,70,248,1764,3,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
SYSTEMATIC BOTANY,Insights into Species Delimitation of Selected Species in the Flowering Plant Genus Medicago section Buceras (Leguminosae),"The genus Medicago (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae) contains about 90 species including the important forage crop alfalfa Medicago sativa and the genomic model Medicago truncatula. Despite intensive research on the genus because of its agricultural importance, there is a relative lack of information about chromosome number and genome size in some Medicago species, especially those from Medicago section Buceras that were formerly placed in the sister genus Trigonella, and are paraphyletic to the remainder of the genus Medicago. Past studies revealed that previous species delimitations did not conform well with complex patterns of morphological or genetic variation. Some published chromosome numbers, e.g. 2n = 28 and 2n = 44, differ from those of the rest of the genus, which are mostly 2n = 16 or polyploids thereof, although some cases of aneuploid reduction or dysploidy (e.g. 2n = 14) do exist. Here we estimated phylogenetic relationships of 42 accessions corresponding to 14 currently recognized Medicago species that are paraphyletic to the remainder of Medicago with a focus on Medicago monantha; for a number of those accessions we obtained estimates of genome size (39) and chromosome number (14). We can confirm the delimitation of two species within M. section Buceras and our data suggest that there are at least two entities with distinct geographic distributions within the currently recognized species M. monantha, which differ in chromosome number and genome size. Our data also suggest that polyploidy and post-polyploid descending dysploidy played a significant role in genome evolution within M. section Buceras.

SYSTEMATIC BOTANY,Investigating Phylogenetic Placement and Species-Level Relationships in a Recent Radiation of Mentzelia section Bartonia (Loasaceae) from the Mojave Desert,"Understanding species level relationships is a central goal in systematic botany; however, complexes of closely related and morphologically similar species often pose considerable challenges to that goal. The North American west is home to many notable genera that notoriously have difficult species complexes (e.g. Astragalus, Eriogonum, Penstemon). Mentzelia section Bartonia (Loasaceae), another example of a group with difficult species complexes, is a recently evolved and diverse clade that occurs across the North American west. Phylogenetic studies have resolved many relationships across Mentzelia, but the relationships within a species complex of perennial, subshrub species that occurs in the Mojave Desert, Great Basin, and Colorado Plateau remains elusive. This arid-adapted clade, which is referred to as the Mojave clade, has significant conservation implications due to three narrowly endemic species: Mentzelia polita and Mentzelia tiehmii are state listed, and Mentzelia leucophylla is federally listed. Species relationships within the Mojave clade are not fully understood. Populations of Mentzelia oreophila from California and Nevada, for example, are not monophyletic. We generated restriction site associated DNA sequence data (RADSeq) to address evolutionary relationships in the Mojave clade. Our results corroborated previous studies in continued recognition of Mentzelia polita, Mentzelia leucophylla, and Mentzelia tiehmii; however, Mentzelia oreophila was recovered in three clades that includes a California clade, a Nevada clade, and one with Mentzelia puberula. Incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization might have generated conflicting phylogenetic signal between Mentzelia oreophila and Mentzelia puberula.

Here, we present the first broad phylogenetic analysis focused on Stigmatodon, sampling a total of 83 terminals, including 16 of the 20 species of the genus and the morphologically similar species of Vriesea. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis using two plastid markers (matK and rps16-trnK) and the nuclear gene PHYC to infer phylogenetic relationships and reconstruct ancestral states for ecological and morphological characters. Our results suggest the monophyly of Stigmatodon as originally circumscribed is only possible with the inclusion of morphologically and ecologically similar Vriesea species. In addition, the morphological and anatomical traits led us to propose a new circumscription for the genus, combining eight species of Vriesea to Stigmatodon as S. andaraiensis, S. freicanecanus, S. lancifolius, S. limae, S. oliganthus, S. pseudoliganthus, S. vellozicolus, and S. zonatus. The stomata positioned above the ordinary epidermal cells, the adaxial water-storage parenchyma with axially elongated cells, the stamens positioned in two groups of three on each side of the corolla, and the tubo-laciniate stigma are exclusive to Stigmatodon in its new circumscription.

To investigate the evolution of mutualism between Cecropia and associated ants, a phylogenetic framework is necessary. Cecropia species are difficult to distinguish morphologically and conventional genetic markers are insufficiently variable to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among species. Our study aimed to compare the phylogenetic utility of restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to prior work based on commonly sequenced gene regions. RAD sequence data resolved and supported species-level relationships better than previous studies. We identified a deeply divergent non-myrmecophytic Glade including C. sciadophylla and African Musanga. Results from geographically widespread and morphologically heterogenous C. obtusifolia and C. angustifoha suggest that current synonymy has lumped phylogenetically divergent lineages.

Systematic studies of the group have rarely considered the carpological characters, so their taxonomic importance has not been analyzed in detail. The aim of this study is to analyze the morphological characteristics of these organs to provide more information for a better species separation and for a more robust infra-generic classification. We provide a detailed description of Spigelia fruits and seeds of the Mexican species since the country represents one of its main centers of diversification. Fruits and seed samples from 54 individuals across 14 species were measured and photographed to describe each one, maintaining as much detail as possible. With the morphological matrix a DFA, PCA, and a dendrogram using the NJ method was performed. The fruits and seeds of the Mexican Spigelia species proved to be taxonomically useful, allowing the differentiation of four main clusters of species separated by the size of the analyzed structures in the three analyses (DFA, PCA, NJ). The results show the variation in size and shape of the structures analyzed, which shows the taxonomic importance of fruits and seeds of the genus Spigelia.

SYSTEMATIC BOTANY,Morphological Reanalysis of the Pedicularis sudetica Complex of Arctic North America: Character Trimming with Occam's Razor,"Pedicularis sudetica can be a difficult complex to identify and classify using herbarium specimens. Colors fade, rendering corolla patterns indistinct. Especially problematic is the presence of spots on the lobes of the lower lip and color patterns of the galea. Spots are either clearly visible or so faded that only a few spots are visible on one or two flowers in the inflorescence. Galeas are either unequivocally bicolored, solid, or indistinctly diffuse. Other characters have been inconsistently applied by taxonomists and/or are difficult to discern. All these factors combined only serve to confound taxon identity and classification, and members of the complex have been classified as species, subspecies, or even varieties by different taxonomists. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) of qualitative traits and principal component analysis (PCA) of quantitative traits were employed to explore the character and taxonomic structure of the group. MCA revealed that only three characters are necessary to classify the four taxa of the complex. No taxon structure was evident with PCA. Abundance of intermediate specimens over a broad geographic range indicates hybridization is extensive among members of the complex and suggests that a subspecific classification of the group is appropriate.",Multiple correspondence analysis; principal component analysis; subspecies,2022,47,2,10.1600/036364422X16512564801650,0363-6445,16,123,193,1304,3,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
SYSTEMATIC BOTANY,Morphological and Molecular Evidence Support Elevating Erythroxylum macrophyllum var. savannarum (Erythroxylaceae) to Specific Status,"Erythroxylum macrophyllum is a morphologically variable and widely distributed species complex in Central and South America with several sub-specific taxa and numerous species included in its synonymy. A single variety grows in the Colombo-Venezuelan savanna region which can be distinguished from the rest of the E. macrophyllum complex by the size of leaves, cataphyll and stipule characteristics, and shape of calyx lobes. A molecular phylogeny reconstructed from 519 nuclear genes also reveals that the savanna variety is more closely related to E. acuminatum and E. pauciflorum than E. macrophyllum. This phylogenomic evidence also suggests Erythroxylum sect. Macrocalyx, to which E. macrophyllum belongs, is a polyphyletic taxonomic section. We thus propose elevating this variety to specific status, as Erythroxylum savannarum.

SYSTEMATIC BOTANY,New Entities of Paspalum and a Synopsis of the Dilatata Group,"New entities in the allopolyploid Dilatata complex of Paspalum are formally described and illustrated. Three sexual tetraploids formerly subsumed under Paspalum dilatatum are recognized as discrete taxonomic entities: P. plurinerve and P. vacarianum are described as new species, and P. dilatatum subsp. flavescens is upgraded to species rank as P. flavescens. Both P. vacarianum and P. plurinerve are distributed in the Brazilian southern Plateau (Planalto Meridional), in the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, the first one in the eastern region and the second one in the western region including adjacent areas of NE Argentina. Paspalum flavescens is distributed in southeastern Uruguay and the provinces of Buenos Aires and Cordoba (Argentina). The apomictic allohexaploid P. torrense, distributed along the coastal areas of the Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Parana, and adjacent regions along the edge of the southern Plateau, also deserves specific status, whereas two further hexaploid biotypes are differentiated from the pentaploid P. dilatatum var. dilatatum and described as Paspalum dilatatum var. chiru and P. dilatatum var. uruguaianense. Paspalum dilatatum var. chiru is restricted to a small area around the locality of Molles Grande, in the department of Paysandu, Uruguay; whereas P. dilatatum var. uruguaianense is distributed in the SW of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and northern Uruguay.

Support for the new genus is provided by a phylogenetic analysis based on target enrichment (TE) data including 618 nuclear loci with a total of 248,940 nucleotides, and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI). Five species, whose DNA sequences were obtained by TE during this study, form a strongly supported clade sister to the large clade comprising Pedaliodes and four other genera. Complementary COI analysis confirms the monophyly of Viloriodes gen. n., with the above five plus eight other species clustering in highly supported clades in both Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood analyses, and a TE + COI concatenated tree. Based on molecular and morphological data, 30 species are assigned to Viloriodes gen. n. The new genus can be recognized by a set of subtle morphological characteristics of colour patterns and male and female genitalia. An analysis of divergence times indicates that Viloriodes gen. n. and Steromapedaliodes Forster separated around 5.9 Mya. Viloriodes gen. n. has a wider geographic distribution than any other genus of the Pedaliodes complex, being found from central Mexico to northern Argentina and to the Guyana Shield, typically occurring at lower elevations than Pedaliodes.",Andes; genitalia; phylogenies; Pronophilina; target enrichment sequencing; Viloriodes gen; n,2023,48,1,10.1111/syen.12568,0307-6970,15,113,218,1420,7,NA,250,7,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY,Investment in visual system predicted by floral associations in sap beetles (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae),"Patterns in morphological variation are a central theme of evolution. Uncovering links between morphological character evolution and natural history, specifically feeding behaviour, is important to understanding biological diversity. Species within the sap beetles (Nitidulidae) exhibit a tremendous diversity of feeding behaviours. This immense diversity of feeding can be seen both between major lineages and very closely related taxa. Feeding behaviour diversity may drive morphological variation in several character systems (e.g., eyes). For example, in a shift from feeding on rotting fruit to flower-visiting (anthophily), selective pressures on the visual system may vary and ultimately lead to differences in eye morphology. We tested for potential morphological shifts in relative eye size among adult beetles. We specifically tested for significant relationships between relative eye size and the following factors flower-visiting and sex. We also tested for the influence of phylogeny on the evolution of relative eye size, implementing tests of trait correlation across a topology. We found greater relative eye size in taxa exhibiting anthophilous behaviour, regardless of phylogenetic relatedness or feeding behaviour of sister taxa. We were unable to recover a relationship between relative eye size and sex. Thus, feeding behaviour is currently the strongest predictor of eye size in sap beetles.",anthophily; character evolution; Coleoptera; feeding shifts; foraging ecology,2023,48,1,10.1111/syen.12558,0307-6970,13,101,201,1413,5,NA,250,7,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY,Massive gene rearrangements of mitochondrial genomes and implications for the phylogeny of Trichoptera (Insecta),"Mitochondrial genomes have been widely used for phylogenetic reconstruction and evolutionary analysis in various groups of Insecta. Gene rearrangements in the mitogenome can be informative characters for phylogenetic reconstruction and adaptive evolution. Trichoptera is one of the most important groups of aquatic insects. Prior to this study, complete mitogenomes from Trichoptera were restricted to eight families, resulting in a biased view of their mitogenome structure and evolution. Here, we assemble new mitogenomes for 66 species by high-throughput sequencing. The mitogenomes of 19 families and 47 genera are documented for the first time. Combined with 16 previously published mitogenomes of Trichoptera, we find 14 kinds of gene rearrangement patterns novel for Trichoptera, including rearrangement of protein-coding genes, tRNAs and control regions. Simultaneously, we provide evidence for the occurrence of tandem duplication and non-random loss events in the mitogenomes of three families. Phylogenetic analyses show that Hydroptilidae was recovered as a sister group to Annulipalpia. The increased nucleotide substitution rate and adaptive evolution may have affected the mitochondrial gene rearrangements in Trichoptera. Our study offers new insights into the mechanisms and patterns of mitogenome rearrangements in Insecta at large and into the usefulness of mitogenomic gene order as a phylogenetic marker within Trichoptera.",evolution; Hydroptilidae; phylogeny; protein-coding gene rearrangement; TNDL,2023,48,2,10.1111/syen.12575,0307-6970,14,112,201,1444,5,NA,250,7,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY,Phylogenomic inference of two widespread European leaf miner species complexes suggests mechanisms for sympatric speciation (Lepidoptera: Nepticulidae: Ectoedemia),"Leafmining insects have extraordinarily intimate relationships with their host plants and are therefore prime candidates for potential ecological speciation in sympatry, but how commonly this mode of speciation occurs in any group of life remains debated. Prior research on the pygmy moth (Nepticulidae) genus Ectoedemia using morphology, DNA barcoding, and multi-marker phylogenetic approaches left two unresolved species complexes, each with each four described species. In this study, we thoroughly sampled each complex across a range of host plants and localities across Europe. We used a double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing approach to clarify species boundaries. In the E. rubivora complex, ddRAD data resolved all four species, contrary to morphological and COI data, which supports a potential scenario of host plant-driven speciation where the host plant specialization provides an ecological barrier to hybridization. However, we found no indication of host race formation within the oligophagous E. atricollis (Stainton). In the E. subbimaculella complex, SNP data only partly distinguishes between the parapatric E. subbimaculella (Haworth) and E. heringi (Toll), but with some statistical overlap, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting which may represent early phases of host-based ecological speciation, or admixture following a period of isolation.",ddRAD-seq; ecological speciation; host plants; insect-plant relations; pygmy moths,2023,48,2,10.1111/syen.12579,0307-6970,18,163,194,1393,5,NA,250,7,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY,Phylogenomics of the family Lachesillidae (Insecta: Psocodea: Psocomorpha),"Lachesillidae is one of the largest families of bark lice and includes more than 420 described species, in 26 genera and three subfamilies. This family belongs in the suborder Psocomorpha, infraorder Homilopsocidea. The classification of Lachesillidae is based on male and female genital morphologies, but questions remain regarding the monophyly of the family and some of its genera. Here, we used whole genome and transcriptome data to generate a 2060 orthologous gene data matrix of 2,438,763 aligned bp and used these data to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of species of Lachesillidae and relatives. Taxon sampling included 24 species from Lachesillidae and 23 additional species belonging to related families from the infraorders Homilopsocidea and Caeciliusetae. Phylogenetic relationships reconstructed with maximum likelihood and coalescent-based analyses indicated paraphyly of Lachesillidae, and monophyly of the tribe Graphocaeciliini and the genus Lachesilla were also never recovered. Instability was observed in the position of Eolachesilla chilensis, which was recovered either as sister to Elipsocidae or to Mesopsocidae species, so we cannot conclusively determine the position of this genus within the Homilopsocidea. Given our results, a reclassification is necessary, but more taxon sampling of other species in Mesopsocidae and Peripsocidae would be useful to add to a tree in future before proposing a new classification.",Eo; chilensis; genomics; Graphocaeciliini; Lachesilla; phylogenetic relationships,2023,48,2,10.1111/syen.12577,0307-6970,8,74,208,1455,6,NA,250,7,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY,Phylogeny and systematics of Sphaeriusidae (Coleoptera: Myxophaga): minute living fossils with underestimated past and present-day diversity,"Sphaeriusidae (Coleoptera: Myxophaga) is a group of shiny, blackish and hemispherical riparian beetles, known for their miniaturized bodies. They are worldwide in distribution, but very limited information is available about taxonomic and morphological diversity, and natural and evolutionary history. The aim of this study is to help fill in these gaps. We examined the external morphology of modern representatives using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and reconstructed the phylogeny of the family using five DNA markers (cytochrome oxidase I, 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, CAD and wingless). Our results suggest a larger morphological diversity than previously expected, corresponding to the deep genetic divergences of principal lineages. We also examined two inclusions in 99-million-year-old Burmese amber. The integration of all evidence allows us to recognize three genera: the extinct genus \& DAG;Burmasporum Kirejtshuk, the newly defined genus Bezesporum gen.nov. preserved in Burmese amber (B. burmiticum sp.nov.) and present in the modern fauna of Southeast Asia, and the genus Sphaerius Waltl with a world-wide distribution. Sphaerius species are morphologically highly uniform, with the exception of species from Australia and South Africa, which share some characteristics with Bezesporum gen.nov. despite being resolved as deeply nested lineages of Sphaerius by DNA data. The presence of Bezesporum gen.nov. in Burmese amber and in recent fauna indicates that Sphaeriusidae largely maintained their specific morphology and specialized riparian lifestyle for at least 100 million years. Therefore, they can be considered an exceptionally conserved group, with a minimum of evolutionary changes over a long period. Our study also demonstrates that the species numbers and fine-scale morphological diversity of Sphaeriusidae are larger than expected in both the past and present-day faunas. Both were apparently underestimated due to the minute body size and cryptic habits of these beetles.",Burmese amber; classification; Coleoptera; distribution; diversity; DNA phylogeny; fossil record; living fossil; morphology; Myxophaga; new genus; Sphaeriusidae,2023,48,2,10.1111/syen.12571,0307-6970,16,140,286,2000,12,NA,250,7,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY,Phylogeny of Membracoidea (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha) based on transcriptome data,"The suborder Auchenorrhyncha ({''}true hoppers{''}) comprises nearly half of known Hemiptera, with >43,000 known species of sap-sucking herbivores distributed worldwide, including many important agricultural pests and vectors of plant disease. More than half of the known Auchenorrhyncha belong to superfamily Membracoidea (leaf- and treehoppers), which has been a source of phylogenetic contention for many years. To construct an improved backbone phylogeny of this superfamily, we obtained transcriptome data for multiple representatives of all 5 previously established extant families and nearly all subfamilies to test their monophyly and relationships. 138 taxa (132 Membracoidea and 6 outgroups) were sampled with an emphasis on families Cicadellidae and Membracidae, which were paraphyletic as previously defined by most authors, several problematic subfamilies (Aphrodinae, Eurymelinae, Ledrinae, Nicomiinae, Stegaspidinae and Tartessinae). We analysed different combinations of data sets (amino acid, complete nucleotide and degeneracy-coded nucleotide) using different modelling schemes. The resultant trees based on different analyses are congruent in most nodes. Discordant nodes mainly pertain to relationships among cicadellid subfamilies and tribal relationships within Aphrodinae and Eurymelinae. Analyses of gene- and site concordance factors and quartet scores indicate that this instability is largely attributable to an overall lack of informative characters across genes and sites rather than strongly supported conflict among genes. According to the congruent nodes, we make the following revisions: combine Stegaspidinae and Centrotinae into a single subfamily, Centrotinae sensu lato; restore Stenocotini from Tartessinae to its original position in the Ledrinae; and transform Holdgatiella Evans from Nicomiinae to Melizoderinae. In addition, to solve the paraphyly of both Cicadellidae and Membracidae, a preferred option would be to combine all five previously recognized families into a single family, Membracidae sensu lato; the other option could be to render Cicadellidae monophyletic by excluding Megophthalminae and Ulopinae from Cicadellidae and elevating them to status as separate families.",Insecta; Cicadomorpha; leafhoppers; treehoppers; phylogenomics,2023,48,1,10.1111/syen.12563,0307-6970,9,82,299,2226,5,NA,250,7,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY,Diversification in and around the Atlas Mountains: Insights into the systematics and biogeography of the genus Thalpomena (Orthoptera: Acrididae: Oedipodinae),"The genus Thalpomena Saussure comprises nine species and four subspecies and is largely endemic to the Atlas Mountains (North Africa). Here, we used an evolutionary taxonomic approach to differentiate the species of the genus Thalpomena and to reconstruct their biogeographic history. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on five molecular markers revealed four distinct clades within the genus Thalpomena. These are not fully in line with the current taxonomy but rather seem to represent lineages defined by their distribution and hind wing banding patterns. All lineages are geographically separated and can be distinguished based on genetic, morphometric and ecological modelling data. Ancestral area reconstruction suggests an origin of the species in the southern regions of the Atlas Mountains (High Atlas to Aures Mountains). Molecular clock analysis promotes the glacial refugia theory, supporting the origin of Thalpomena in the Pliocene, followed by diversification events in the Pleistocene.",ancestral area reconstruction; band-winged grasshoppers; diversity hotspot; ecological niche modelling; Maghreb; North Africa; radiation; wing colouration,2022,47,3,10.1111/syen.12537,0307-6970,20,158,144,1005,8,NA,250,7,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY,"From modern to classic: Classification of the planthopper family Issidae (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha, Fulgoroidea) derived from a total-evidence phylogeny","The Issidae are highly diverse in terms of morphology and species richness. Despite recent efforts, the internal phylogeny and classification of this planthopper family remain controversial. Here, we present a phylogeny of the family inferred with Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses of a nine-gene molecular dataset (4702 bp) and morphological data (35 characters) across a broad sample of taxa (99 terminals). Based on these results, we verify the taxonomic status of the issid subfamilies, tribes and generic complexes. Results revealed a well-supported basal dichotomy of the family into two clades, corresponding to the subfamilies Issinae and Hysteropterinae. Within Issinae, the tribes Issini, Thioniini, Sarimini, Hemisphaeriini, Parahiraciini and Kodaianellini were recovered with high support. Four strongly statistically supported clades were revealed within the subfamily Hysteropterinae, but we refrain from taxonomic decisions in the absence of morphological characters to diagnose the clades A-C. Interestingly, the obtained results are in good agreement with L. Melichar's view on Issidae classification suggested more than a century ago. Our results challenge an early Cretaceous origin of the Issidae and the basal split of the family between Neotropical taxa (Thioniini) and the remaining issids.",biogeography; molecular phylogeny; morphology; taxonomy,2022,47,4,10.1111/syen.12546,0307-6970,18,154,187,1320,4,NA,250,7,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY,Genomics-based higher classification of the species-rich hairstreaks (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Eumaeini),"We propose a higher classification of the lycaenid hairstreak tribe Eumaeini - one of the youngest and most species-rich butterfly tribes - based on autosome, Lepidopteran Z sex chromosome and mitochondrial protein-coding genes. The subtribe Neolycaenina Korb is a synonym of Callophryidina Tutt and subtribe Tmolusina Balint is a synonym of Strephonotina K. Johnson, Austin, Le Crom, \& Salazar. Proposed names are Rhammina Prieto \& Busby, new subtribe; Timaetina Busby \& Prieto, new subtribe; Atlidina Martins \& Duarte, new subtribe; Evenina Faynel \& Grishin, new subtribe; Jantheclina Robbins \& Faynel, new subtribe; Paiwarriina Lamas \& Robbins, new subtribe; Cupatheclina Lamas \& Grishin, new subtribe; Parrhasiina Busby \& Robbins, new subtribe; Ipideclina Martins \& Grishin, new subtribe; and Trichonidina Duarte \& Faynel, new subtribe. Phylogenetic results from the autosome and Z sex chromosome analyses are similar. Future analyses of datasets with hundreds of terminal taxa may be more practical time-wise by focussing on the smaller number of sex chromosome sequences (2.6\% of nuclear protein-coding sequences). The phylogenetic classification and biological summaries for each subtribe suggest that a variety of factors affected Eumaeini diversification. About a dozen kinds of male secondary sexual organs with frequent evolutionary gains and losses occur in Atlidina, Evenina and Jantheclina (141 species combined). Females have been shown to use these organs to discriminate between conspecific and nonconspecific males, facilitating sympatry among close relatives. Eumaeina, Rhammina and Timaetina (140 species combined) are overwhelmingly montane with some evidence for a higher incidence of sympatric diversification. Seven Neotropical lineages in five subtribes invaded the temperate parts of the Nearctic Region with a diversification increase in the Callophryidina (262 species). North American Satyrium and Callophrys then invaded the Palearctic at least once each, with a major species-richness increase in Satyrium. The evolution of litter-feeding detritivores within Calycopidina (172 species) resulted in an increase in diversification rate compared with its flower-feeding sister lineage. Atlidina, Strephonotina, Parrhasiina and Strymonina (562 species combined) each contain a mixture of genera that specialize on one or two caterpillar food plant families and genera that are polyphagous. These would be appropriate subtribes to assess how the breadth of caterpillar food plants and the frequency of host shifts affected diversification.",diversification; food plant specialization; male secondary sexual organs; polyphagy; Theclinae; Z sex chromosome,2022,47,3,10.1111/syen.12541,0307-6970,10,104,362,2577,6,NA,250,7,No,275,225,yes,no,yes

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,Reduction of technogenic geochemical fluxes during the operation of a polymineral deposit in the Far Eastern Region,"Heavy metal oxides are potentially highly reactionary capable and cytotoxic. They cause direct DNA damage and decrease viability of the cells of a living organism. To ensure environmental safety impacts that accompany processing gold-bearing sands deposits, studies of microelement, phase and grain-size composition of rocks have been carried out. There are established elements prevailing by mass: phosphorus, lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, barium, zirconium, chromium, strontium, as well as clay minerals, complicating the process of selecting valuable components. The revealed combination of mineral components has a high migration ability and toxicity. It is developed the technology reducing operations of leaching and hydrometallurgical processing. The complex of tools allows you to effectively select valuable components by hydrodynamic and cavitation impact on the clay component.

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,Resistance of soil micromycetes Trichoderma viride and Alternaria alternata to heavy metals Cu and Pb,"Heavy metals (HM) in the soil cause changes in the ratio of resistant and susceptible fungal species, the mechanisms of interaction between which are not well understood. The aim of this work is to study the resistance to Cu and Pb cations and the antagonistic properties of two species of soil micromycetes Alternaria alternata and Trichoderma viride. Fungal resistance was assessed by the following test functions: biomass accumulation, colony diameter, and sporulation activity. The antagonistic activity of fungal species was assessed by competition test. The calculated effective concentrations and tolerance indices made it possible to conclude that A. alternata and T. viride are highly resistant to the investigated HMs. At the same time, species differences in the patterns of reactions were found. The growth of A. alternata colonies was inhibited to a greater extent than T. viride, however at the same HM concentration, the stimulation of sporulation in Alternaria was more pronounced than in the rapidly growing Trichoderma. The studied strain T. viride turned out to be quite competitive with respect to the phytopathogenic fungus A. alternata, and its antagonistic properties were well pronounced in the medium with HM.

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,Chemical composition of the surface water in the Ob River,"The Ob River is a multifunctional water body used for fishery purposes, shipping, irrigation, recreation and drinking water supply. The research on the river water quality related to the assessment of ecological state and studying the regularities of chemical composition dynamics is topical nowadays. The paper presents the results of investigation of the hydrochemical composition (major ions: Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, SO42-, Cl-, F-, nutrients: N, P, Si and trace elements: Li, Be, B, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Mo, Cd, Ba, Pb, Fe, Mn) of the Ob River water near the city of Barnaul. The study was performed by Chemical-Analytical Center, Institute for Water and Environmental Problems of Siberian Branch RAS. The content of ions PO43-, Si, and COD (chemical oxygen consumption) was determined using a DR-2800 Hach Lange spectrophotometer, while the mineral composition, NH4+, NO2-, NO3- ions - with a Dionex ICS-3000 ion chromatograph. The concentration of trace elements was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS) on an ICAP-Qc spectrometer. The dynamics of elements content in the Ob water was determined in different hydrological seasons of 2018.

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,Host by strain association study of rhizospheric actinobacteria on two Algerian date palm cultivars,"Extreme ecosystems such as the Algerian Sahara can be a source of untapped microorganisms that produce novel bioactive compounds against fusarium wilt disease. Effective control of fusarium wilt agent Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. albedinis relies on a thorough understanding of host-by-strain relations. Achieving this understanding can be highly beneficial, particularly for extensive multidimensional experiments. This paper investigates the qualitative and quantitative distribution of the actinobacteria in the rhizosphere (endorhizosphere and pneumatodes) of two date palm cultivars, one resistant (Takerbucht) and one susceptible to fusariosis (Aghamu). Consequently, 199 actinobacterial isolates were recorded; 13 species were identified, 6 were identified in root tips, and 10 in pneumatodes. The highest actinobacterial densities were recorded in the rhizospheric soils of the susceptible cultivar. However, the dominant species are present in the roots of the resistant ones. Differences in the composition of genera and species were found between cultivars. Actinobacteria are mainly represented by the genera Streptomyces and Nocardioides, which are respectively related to healthy and diseased date palm cultivars. Numerically, the most important species are related to S. chartreusis, Nocardioides albus and S. gannmycicus. Consequently, correspondence analysis facilitated the visual representation (associations patterns) of host-by-strain data and confirmed the aforementioned findings.",Actinobacteria; saharan oases; date-palm; endorhizosphere; Pneumatodes; host by strain association,2022,NA,3,10.25750/1995-4301-2022-3-135-141,1995-4301,14,99,197,1500,6,10,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,Heavy metals in snow cover and urban soils,"The pollution of snow cover and soils of different functional zones of the city of Kirov with heavy metals (HM) has been assessed. Judging by the state of the snow cover, the level of air pollution with Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cd in winter in different functional zones of the northern part of the city and in the background territory differs slightly, but varies significantly over the years of observation. A correlation was found (r = 0.98-0.99) between the content of HMs in the snow cover and their total content in the soil. It is shown that the level of soil pollution depends on the selected background indicators. In the absence of excess of gross forms of HM over approximate permissible concentrations, the indicator of total pollution (Z(c)) corresponds to the average level of soil pollution in the industrial zone. Pollution is diagnosed by the accumulation of mobile HM compounds, and the mobility coefficients (indicators that do not depend on the selected background) make it possible to assess the risk of accumulation of Pb and Cd in soils in exchangeable and carbonate-related forms in the industrial, as well as in the recreational areas of the northern part of the city, as very high.",heavy metals; accumulation snow cover; urban soils; urbanized areas; atmospheric air,2022,NA,3,10.25750/1995-4301-2022-3-110-117,1995-4301,8,42,203,1198,5,10,300,8,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Several rivers originating from the swamp Chistoye are flowing through the territory of the Kirov region. Water taken from the swamp Chistoye and 1.5 km from it is characterized by an acidic and slightly acidic reaction (pH 4.3-5.8) and a low content of dissolved oxygen. In water of the swamp Chistoye, a high content of biogenic elements and organic substances was noted, which is associated with intensive processes of decomposition of organic matter in this ecosystem.

Utilization of these biogenic wastes is a serious economic and environmental problem for the agro-industrial complex. The work is devoted to the study of the influence of the liquid fraction of pig farm manure effluents on the sanitary condition of arable land according to agrochemical and microbiological studies of soil samples. The study revealed that the regular introduction of pig manure into arable land (for 5 years) led to a significant increase in the content of mobile forms of phosphorus and potassium; there was a pronounced tendency to the accumulation of copper and zinc in the arable horizon of the soil, in addition, high values of the total microbial number, the index of bacteria of the group Escherichia coli, Enterococci and Clostridium perfringens.

Of the 38 fungal isolates selected in pure culture, eight were identified by cultural and morphological features as Parastagonospora nodorum which causes Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB). To confirm the species identity, the DNA of fungi was used for real-time PCR using the commercial test system ``Septorioz zlakov (Stagonospora nodorum){'' ({''}AgroDiagnostika{''}, Russia). Based on experimental data, a modification of the method for isolating fungi that cause Septoria blotch of wheat is proposed.

The use of malt-yeast agar as a medium in comparison with PGA stimulated the growth rate of the P. nodorum KR isolate and did not affect the growth rate of other fungal isolates.

THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,A general mathematical model for coevolutionary dynamics of mutualisms with partner discrimination,"Mutualisms (reciprocally beneficial heterospecific interactions) are thought as susceptible to exploitation by ``cheaters{''} receiving benefits from partners without fair return. Theoretical studies suggest that partner discrimination is one of the key mechanisms to prevent cheaters from prevailing, but recently, a paradox is suggested that costly partner discrimination might collapse as the result of decreasing in quality variation among potential partners imposed by partner discrimination itself. Here, I develop a simple general mathematical model that consists of two host strains (discriminators/indiscriminators) and two symbiont strains (cooperators/non-cooperators) to establish a framework for the coevolutionary dynamics of mutualisms. First, I present a basic model, a positive equilibrium of which is neutrally stable. Secondly, I derive a formula to describe how the equilibrium shifts with a change in arbitrary parameters: I show a counter-intuitive result that the equilibrium frequency of discriminator hosts decreases as discrimination efficiency increases. Finally, I examine how the equilibrium and its stability changes by adding dependence of fitness of symbionts or hosts on their own frequencies: I find that negative or positive frequency dependence makes the equilibrium asymptotically stable or unstable, respectively. I also find that mutation and immigration of symbionts always make the equilibrium asymptotically stable, even if it does not increase low-quality symbionts.",One-to-many mutualisms; Partner choice; Replicator equation; Volterra's principle,2022,15,3,10.1007/s12080-022-00537-x,1874-1738,12,98,205,1509,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Climate warming and dispersal strategies determine species persistence in a metacommunity,"Dispersal is crucial in governing species response toward climate warming. Previous studies suggest that intermediate and density-dependent dispersal enables the functioning of a metacommunity, stabilizing populations at local and regional scales. Here, we consider a spatial ecological model with temperature-dependent traits to elucidate dispersal effects in stabilizing population dynamics under climate warming. Specifically, we analyze the effect of species temperature-dependent life-history traits on a metacommunity dynamics with diverse dispersal strategies (i.e., constant and density-dependent dispersal), tracked along with different dispersal rates of species (relative dispersal). At low and intermediate temperatures, different dispersal strategies synchronize or desynchronize the population dynamics depending upon dispersal rates. However, high temperatures completely synchronize the population trailing constant dispersal, weakening the stabilizing dynamics. Furthermore, density-dependent dispersal strongly affects the stability of metacommunity at high temperatures by increasing or decreasing spatial synchrony depending on dispersal rates. In metacommunities with many patches, conditional upon temperature, species abundance exhibits coexistence of synchronous and asynchronous oscillations, namely the chimera state. Overall, our results show that rising temperature may destabilize the dynamics by synchronizing populations; however, some dispersal mechanisms might impede the adverse outcomes.",Climate warming; Metacommunity dynamics; Constant dispersal and density-dependent dispersal; Synchronization; Population stability,2022,15,1,10.1007/s12080-022-00531-3,1874-1738,11,89,183,1522,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Coexistence patterns and diversity in a trait-based metacommunity on an environmental gradient,"The dynamics of trait-based metacommunities have attracted much attention, but not much is known about how dispersal and spatial environmental variability mutually interact with each other to drive coexistence patterns and diversity. Here, we present a spatially explicit model of competition for two essential resources in a metacommunity on a one-dimensional environmental gradient. We find that both the strength of dispersal and the range of spatial environmental variability affect coexistence patterns, spatial structure, trait distribution, and local and regional diversity. Without dispersal, species are sorted according to their optimal growth conditions on the gradient. With the onset of dispersal, source-sink effects are initiated, which increases the effects of environmental filtering and interspecific competition and generates trait lumping, so that only a few species from an environment-defined trait range can survive. Interestingly, for very large dispersal rates, species distributions become spatially homogeneous, but nevertheless two species at the extreme ends of the trade-off curve can coexist for large environmental variability. Local species richness follows a classic hump-shaped dependence on dispersal rate, while local and regional diversity exhibit a pronounced peak for intermediate values of the environmental variability. Our findings provide important insights into the factors that shape the structure of trait-based metacommunities.",Dispersal; Resource competition; Metacommunity; Environmental filtering; Species sorting; Biodiversity; Trait lumping,2022,15,1,10.1007/s12080-021-00526-6,1874-1738,12,94,201,1475,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Complex ecological communities and the emergence of island species-area relationships,"It has been a century since the species-area relationship (SAR) was first proposed as a power law to explain how species richness scales with area. There have been many attempts to explain the origin of this predominant form. Apart from the power law, numerous empirical studies also report a semi-log form of the SAR, but very few have addressed its incidence. In this work, we test whether these relationships could emerge from the assembly of large random communities on island-like systems. The clustering of same-species individuals is central to our results, which we incorporate by modifying the self-interaction term in the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. Our analysis demonstrates that the two most widely reported relationship forms can emerge due to differences in immigration rates and skewness towards weak interactions. We particularly highlight the incidence of the semi-log SAR for low immigration rates from a source pool, which is consistent with several previous empirical studies. The two SAR forms might show good fits to data over a large span of areas but a power-law overestimates species richness on smaller islands in remote archipelagoes.",Community assembly; Macroecology; Species-area relationship; Complex ecological communities,2022,15,4,10.1007/s12080-022-00545-x,1874-1738,10,85,181,1171,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Diverse perspectives from diverse scholars are vital for theoretical biology,"Science is based on studying some aspects of the world while holding others constant. The assumptions of what can and cannot be ignored implicitly shape our understanding of the world around us. This truth is particularly evident when studying biology through mathematical models, where one must explicitly state assumptions during the process of model building. Although we often recognize that all models are ``wrong{''} in their assumptions, we often overlook the corollary that developing multiple models that are wrong in different ways can help us triangulate truth in our understanding. Theoretical biologists build models in the image of how they envision the world, an image that is shaped by their scientific identity, experiences, and perspectives. A lack of diversity in any of these axes handicaps our ability to understand biological systems through theory. However, we can overcome this by collectively recognizing our own assumptions, by understanding how perspective shapes the development of theory, and - most importantly - by increasing the diversity of theoretical biologists (in terms of identity, experiences, and perspectives). Combined, this will lead to developing theory that provides a richer understanding of the biological world.",Assumptions; Bias; Diversity; Mathematical model; Theory,2022,15,2,10.1007/s12080-022-00533-1,1874-1738,10,76,188,1259,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Effects of noise correlation and imperfect data sampling on indicators of critical slowing down,"Critical slowing down-based early warning signals (EWSs) are well-known indicators that precede an approaching collapse in complex systems. To date, the majority of studies on the predictability of critical transitions consider systems perturbed with temporally uncorrelated noise. In contrast, here we study catastrophic and non-catastrophic transitions, and the performance of associated EWSs in systems perturbed with correlated noise. We find that elevated noise correlation can advance the occurrence of a catastrophic transition, and simultaneously progresses the system's recovery. However, noise correlation does not have a significant impact on the likelihood of non-catastrophic transitions. We show that depending upon the transition mechanism, the occurrence of weak to false signals increases with noise reddening. Imperfect data sampling, both spatial and temporal, further reduces the efficacy of EWSs. Spatially limited data has more impact on the efficacy of EWSs for negative noise correlation than that of positive. However, temporally imperfect data is more detrimental for positively correlated noise. Overall, our study suggests that performance of EWSs is critical to system-specific perturbations as well as data sampling.",Coloured noise; Alternative stable states; Abrupt and smooth transitions; Imperfect data sampling; Early warning signals,2022,15,2,10.1007/s12080-022-00532-2,1874-1738,14,95,173,1246,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Effects of predator novelty on intraguild predation communities with adaptive prey defense,"Understanding coexistence within community modules such as intraguild predation (IGP), where an omnivore both preys on and competes with an intermediate consumer for a shared resource, has provided insight into the mechanisms that promote the persistence of complex food webs. Adaptive, predator-specific defense has been shown theoretically to enhance coexistence of IGP communities when employed by shared prey. Yet to date, all such theory has assumed that prey have an accurate perception of predation risk and appropriate antipredator responses, assumptions that may not be justified when considering a novel predator. We therefore consider the effects of an introduced predator on IGP coexistence, describing two invasion scenarios: suboptimal defense, whereby a similar invader elicits an ineffective antipredator response; and naivete toward an unfamiliar invader, for which prey fail to accurately estimate predation risk. We examine predictions for native predator persistence across gradients of enrichment and defense costs. The model predicts that predator novelty can weaken the effect of adaptive defense, causing exclusion of native predators that would persist in the absence of novelty and inducing unstable dynamics in previously stable regions of parameter space. Coexistence is predicted to be more sensitive to the effects of suboptimal defense than to naivete, and differentially leads to the exclusion of native predators in highly productive environments and when defense costs are low. Moderate novelty of the omnivore can increase resource density via a trophic cascade, while consumer novelty can either lead to omnivore exclusion or facilitate three-species coexistence by providing a subsidy to the otherwise excluded native omnivore. Our analyses suggest that models of adaptive defense are sensitive to assumptions regarding predator-prey eco-evolutionary experience and that predator novelty has significant implications for food web dynamics.",Coexistence; Community module; Trophic omnivory; Non-consumptive effects; Predation risk; Prey naivete; Invasive species,2022,15,2,10.1007/s12080-022-00534-0,1874-1738,12,90,281,1976,7,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Evolutionary rescue can prevent rate-induced tipping,"The transformation of ecosystems proceeds at unprecedented rates. Recent studies suggest that high rates of environmental change can cause rate-induced tipping. In ecological models, the associated rate-induced critical transition manifests during transient dynamics in which populations drop to dangerously low densities. In this work, we study how indirect evolutionary rescue-due to the rapid evolution of a predator's trait-can save a prey population from the rate-induced collapse. Therefore, we explicitly include the time-dependent dynamics of environmental change and evolutionary adaptation in an eco-evolutionary system. We then examine how fast the evolutionary adaptation needs to be to counteract the response to environmental degradation and express this relationship by means of a critical rate. Based on this critical rate, we conclude that indirect evolutionary rescue is more probable if the predator population possesses a high genetic variation and, simultaneously, the environmental change is slow. Hence, our results strongly emphasize that the maintenance of biodiversity requires a deceleration of the anthropogenic degradation of natural habitats.",(Indirect) evolutionary rescue; Rate-induced tipping; Transient dynamics; Eco-evolutionary models; Predator-prey interactions,2022,15,1,10.1007/s12080-021-00522-w,1874-1738,6,52,161,1172,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Host plant limitation of butterflies in highly fragmented landscapes,"Insect herbivores can be limited by host plants in two ways: density-dependent competition for food resources or density-independent search time limitation. Our understanding of density-dependent host plant limitation is relatively well developed and well integrated into conservation plans for at-risk insects. Search time limitation, a density-independent process, is much less well developed. Here, we explore both mechanisms using empirically based models of monarch butterfly population dynamics. These mechanisms differ fundamentally in their predictions: resource competition leads to matching of herbivore densities to host plant densities, and visible competition via consumption of host plants. Search time limitation leads to changes in population growth rate that can cause herbivore numbers to decline when host plant densities are constant. Search time limitation also implies that host plants can limit herbivores, even when many individual plants are uneaten. For monarch butterflies, our calculations suggest that many parts of North America have host plant densities below the threshold for search time limitation, which contrasts with the typical assumption of resource competition. More generally, incorporating search time limitation into conservation plans is important for reframing our understanding of how host plants limit insect herbivores in highly fragmented landscapes.",Search time limitation; Integrodifference equation; Density dependence; Monarch butterfly; Danaus plexippus; Population viability,2022,15,3,10.1007/s12080-021-00527-5,1874-1738,9,68,192,1399,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,How mutation shapes the rate of population spread in the presence of a mate-finding Allee effect,"Although past work has considered how evolution and Allee effects each shape population spread, these factors have rarely been considered together. We develop an integrodifference equation model that tracks individuals of multiple dispersal types (i.e., short- and long-distance dispersers) of male and female individuals subject to a strong Allee effect due to mate-finding process. We use our model to explore how mutation between different dispersal types affects the rate of population spread, since this evolutionary mechanism has been shown to lead to both faster and slower spread in a previous individual-based model. We ask, under what conditions does mutation cause the population to spread faster (or slower) than it spreads without mutation (from the same initial conditions)? We find that mutation can both speed up and slow down invasions. Speeding up occurs in a relatively small range of parameter space near the Allee threshold of the population. Slowing down occurs across a broad range of parameters.",Biological invasion; Range expansion; Eco-evolutionary dynamics; Mutation; Integrodifference equation; Spread speed,2022,NA,NA,10.1007/s12080-022-00540-2,1874-1738,16,96,156,1019,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Ideal free flows of optimal foragers: Vertical migrations in the ocean,"We consider the collective motion of animals in time-varying environments, using as a case the diel vertical migration of marine copepods. The animals are distributed in space such that each animal moves optimally, seeking regions which offer high growth rates and low mortalities, subject to costs on excessive movements as well as being in regions with high densities of conspecifics. The model applies to repeated scenarios such as diel or seasonal patterns, where the animals are aware of both current and future environmental conditions. We show that this problem can be viewed as a differential game of mean field type, and that the evolutionary stable solution, i.e., the Nash equilibrium, is characterized by partial differential equations, which govern the distributions and migration velocities of animals. These equations have similarities to equations that appear in the fluid dynamics, specifically the Euler equations for compressible inviscid fluids. If the environment is constant, the ideal free distribution emerges as an equilibrium. We illustrate the theory with a numerical example of vertical migrations of oceanic copepods, where animals are attracted to nutrient-rich surface waters while repulsed from light during daytime due to the presence of visual predators, aiming to reduce both proximity to conspecifics and swimming efforts. For this case, we show that optimal movements are diel vertical migrations in qualitative agreement with observations of copepods.",Vertical migration; Optimal behavior; Evolutionary games; Habitat selection,2022,15,3,10.1007/s12080-022-00538-w,1874-1738,11,70,222,1489,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Mathematical modeling shows that ball-rolling dung beetles can use dances to avoid competition,"Ball-rolling dung beetles shape a portion of dung into a ball and roll it away from the dung pile for later burial and consumption. These beetles perform dances (rotations and pauses) atop their dung balls in order to choose an initial rolling direction and to correct their rolling direction (reorient). Previous mathematical modeling showed that dung beetles can use reorientation to move away from the dung pile more efficiently. In this work, we study whether reorientation can help beetles avoid competition (i.e., avoid having their dung balls captured), and if so, under what circumstances? This is investigated by implementing a model with two different type of beetles, a roller with a dung ball and a searcher which seeks to capture that dung ball. We show that reorientation can help rollers avoid searchers in a wide range of conditions, but that there are some circumstances in which rolling without reorienting can be a beetle's optimal strategy. We also show that rollers can minimize the probability that their dung ball is captured without making precise measurements of the time interval between dances or the angular deviation for dances.",Dung beetles; Competition; Random walk; Optimization,2022,15,1,10.1007/s12080-021-00523-9,1874-1738,13,94,186,1157,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Nonspreading solutions and patch formation in an integro-difference model with a strong Allee effect and overcompensation,"Previous work involving integro-difference equations of a single species in a homogenous environment has emphasized spreading behavior in unbounded habitats. We show that, under suitable conditions, a simple scalar integro-difference equation incorporating a strong Allee effect and overcompensation can produce solutions where the population persists in an essentially bounded domain without spread despite the homogeneity of the environment. These solutions are robust in that they occupy a region of full measure in parameter space. We develop orbit diagrams showing various patterns of nonspreading solutions from stable equilibria, period-two, to higher periodicity. We show that from a relatively uniform initial density with small stochastic perturbations, a population consisting of multiple isolated patches can emerge. In ecological terms, this work suggests a novel endogenous mechanism for the creation of patch boundaries.",Integro-difference equation; Allee effect; Overcompensation; Nonspreading solution,2022,NA,NA,10.1007/s12080-022-00544-y,1874-1738,16,121,129,935,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,Size-dependent fitness trade-offs of foraging in the presence of predators for prey with different growth patterns,"Prey species make choices about whether to employ costly predator avoidance behaviors throughout their growth and lifecycle. Here, we explore the effects of prey size at a given age (ontogenetic size) and prey growth on optimal behavior using a dynamic optimization model. Under the assumption that prey experience greatest predation risk at intermediate or large sizes, and that growth is fastest at intermediate or large sizes, we find that prey should generally forage when they are small in size and hide when they are larger due to a critical strategy switching size threshold. But this is dependent both on the mortality risks and on the rate of growth. Higher background mortality rates or lower predator-induced detection costs of foraging reduce the size at which prey switches from foraging to hiding. Rapid initial growth leads to decreased overall survival and a wider range of conditions under which the prey hides from the predator. As a test case, the model is parametrized with data and applied to understand differing risk-reducing behaviors between cannibal and non-cannibal Leptinotarsa decemlineata, Colorado potato beetle, larvae. The model predicts that a wide range of parameter values lead to differing behaviors of cannibals and non-cannibals of the same age due to differences in ontogenetic size. We also see that individuals with swifter early growth switch to hiding at larger sizes but will often have earlier strategy switching times. This increases survival of cannibals to the critical pupation size with the largest increases occurring when the baseline death rate is high. Our findings suggest that ecological factors that affect the rate of growth during development, even if final size is not affected, may have an important role in prey responses to predators.",State-dependent foraging; Growth models; Leptinotarsa decemlineata,2022,15,3,10.1007/s12080-022-00535-z,1874-1738,16,114,283,1798,3,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes

Typically, high doses of antibiotics are employed to eliminate the infection quickly and minimize the time under which resistance may emerge. However, this strategy may not be optimal. Since competition can reduce fitness and resistance typically has a reproductive cost, resistant mutants' fitness can depend on their environment. Here we show conditions under which environmental varying fitness can be exploited to prevent the emergence of resistance. We develop a stochastic Lotka-Volterra model of a microbial system with competing phenotypes: a wild strain susceptible to the antibiotic, and a mutant strain that is resistant. We investigate the impact of various pulsed applications of antibiotics on population suppression. Leveraging competition, we show how a strategy of environmental switching can suppress the infection while avoiding resistant mutants. We discuss limitations of the procedure depending on the microbe and pharmacodynamics and methods to ameliorate them.",Antibiotic resistance; Changing environments; Competition; Lotka-Volterra; Microbial ecology; Pulsed antibiotic treatment,2022,15,2,10.1007/s12080-022-00530-4,1874-1738,8,78,181,1267,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,The combined effects of dispersal and herbivores on stable states in coral reefs,"Theory and empirical work suggest that coral reefs may exhibit alternative stable states of coral versus macroalgal dominance. However, it is unclear how dispersal of coral and macroalgae among reefs might impact this bistability and the resilience of the coral-dominated state. We develop a mathematical model to investigate how reef cover dynamics are affected by (1) coral and macroalgal dispersal between two reefs and (2) heterogeneous grazer abundances. We find that at low coral and macroalgal dispersal levels, a new type of stable state emerges with both coral and macroalgae present. Furthermore, we show that a reef abundant with coral and grazers can support a coral-dominated stable state in a second reef depauperate of grazers by dispersal of coral larvae. These results help explain previous empirical findings on reefs once thought to be incongruent with traditional coral-macroalgal alternative stable states theory-such as intermediate coral and macroalgal cover stable states and high coral-low grazing scenarios. Our findings indicate that changing dispersal levels (e.g., due to climate change, reef degradation) between reefs changes the possible stable states and the grazing rate at which the coral-dominated state is predicted to be stable. This work demonstrates the relevance of accounting for the level of dispersal among coral reefs or other bistable ecosystems when designing conservation management plans.",Coral reef; Connectivity; Resilience; Stability analysis; Alternative stable states; Dispersal,2022,15,4,10.1007/s12080-022-00546-w,1874-1738,13,80,213,1437,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,The regulating effect of growth plasticity on the dynamics of structured populations,"Plasticity is the extent to which life history processes such as growth and reproduction depend on the environment. Plasticity in individual growth varies widely between taxa. Nonetheless, little is known about the effect of plasticity in individual growth on the ecological dynamics of populations. In this article, we analyse a physiologically structured population model of a consumer population in which the individual growth rate can be varied between entirely plastic to entirely non-plastic. We derive this population level model from a dynamic energy budget model to ensure an accurate energetic coupling between ingestion, somatic maintenance, growth and reproduction within an individual. We show that the consumer population is either limited by adult fecundity or juvenile survival up to maturation, depending on the level of growth plasticity and the non-plastic individual growth rate. Under these two regimes, we also find two different types of population cycles which again arise due to fluctuation in, respectively, juvenile growth rate or adult fecundity. In the end, our model not only provides insight into the effects of growth plasticity on population dynamics, but also provides a link between the dynamics found in age- and size-structured models.",Somatic growth rate; Size structure; Trade-off; Single-cohort cycles; Population dynamics,2022,15,2,10.1007/s12080-022-00529-x,1874-1738,12,84,191,1272,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,"What's in a resource gradient? Comparing alternative cues for foraging in dynamic environments via movement, perception, and memory","Consumers must track and acquire resources in complex landscapes. Much discussion has focused on the concept of a `resource gradient' and the mechanisms by which consumers can take advantage of such gradients as they navigate their landscapes in search of resources. However, the concept of tracking resource gradients means different things in different contexts. Here, we take a synthetic approach and consider six different definitions of what it means to search for resources based on density or gradients in density. These include scenarios where consumers change their movement behavior based on the density of conspecifics, on the density of resources, and on spatial or temporal gradients in resources. We also consider scenarios involving non-local perception and a form of memory. Using a continuous space, continuous time model that allows consumers to switch between resource-tracking and random motion, we investigate the relative performance of these six different strategies. Consumers' success in matching the spatiotemporal distributions of their resources differs starkly across the six scenarios. Movement strategies based on perception and response to temporal (rather than spatial) resource gradients afforded consumers with the best opportunities to match resource distributions. All scenarios would allow for optimization of resource-matching in terms of the underlying parameters, providing opportunities for evolutionary adaptation, and links back to classical studies of foraging ecology.",Resource matching; Perception; Memory; Oriented movement; Optimal foraging,2022,15,3,10.1007/s12080-022-00542-0,1874-1738,18,131,215,1514,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,When growing pains and sick days collide: infectious disease can stabilize host population oscillations caused by stage structure,"All individuals transition through various life stages over the course of their development and nearly all organisms must contend with infectious disease at some point in their lives. Yet the intersection of these two universal features of life-stage structure and infectious disease-and their joint effects on population dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we develop a two-stage population model in which density dependence acts on juvenile maturation, and infectious disease affects either juveniles or adults via reduction in maturation, reproduction, or survival. In the absence of disease, this form of density dependence can generate persistent population oscillations. We examine whether infectious disease further accentuates these oscillations (by augmenting their amplitude) or stabilizes them (by reducing their amplitude). We find that, for moderate transmission rates (a proxy for disease incidence), disease can stabilize dynamics. In contrast, fast disease transmission is not generally stabilizing, which is, at least in part, due to disease overexploitation of the infectious class. Hydra effects are possible in the model due to density overcompensation and occur when disease increases juvenile mortality or decreases adult fecundity (but do not occur when disease augments adult mortality or reduces maturation). Slow maturation, large disease-free population size, and strong density-dependent population regulation can each lower the transmission rate required for the infectious disease to invade the population.",Density-dependent maturation; Host population stability; Stage-structured epidemiological model; Disease invasional meltdown; Density overcompensation; Generalized hydra effect,2022,15,4,10.1007/s12080-022-00543-z,1874-1738,18,129,215,1538,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"A non-destructive approach to develop tree-level allometric equations for estimating aboveground biomass in the forests of Tripura, Northeast India","Forest tree biomass estimation is a significant issue for the forest management system and to mitigate climate change. Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an indicator of the potential productivity of the ecosystem. However, an accurate estimation method of carbon stock is important for perfect carbon accounting. So, selecting a more appropriate method for biomass assessment is crucial to reaching the goal. Though allometric equations have been used to estimate AGB for both individual species as well as multiple species for regional and pan-tropical scales, species-specific models for a smaller area produce better accuracy. The current initiative has been taken to develop individual tree-level species-specific and generalized local allometric models in a non-destructive manner for the Tripura state of Northeast India, which was the main limitation of carbon stock estimation in the region. Five different forms of log-transformed linearized power equations were tested in the regression models, with AGB as the response variable. The best fit models were chosen based on adjusted R-2, F-statistic, Akaike information criterion, Breusch-Pagan test, Variance Inflation Factor, and three assumptions of linearity. A paired t test was conducted between the predicted and observed AGB values. The best fit generalized equation developed in this study was found to be AGB = 1.03 x exp (- 3.95 + 1.09 ln D-2 + 0.97 ln H - 0.20 N). Compared with some existing pan-tropical and regional models for their predictive accuracy, this equation expressed the highest R-2 value of 0.9089 in an independent testing dataset. When measuring the tree height is difficult due to a closed canopy, the equation AGB = 1.07 x exp (- 2.77 + 2.55 ln D) can be applied to obtain a quick estimation using just the DBH. The equations presented here may be the instrument for estimating carbon stock at the local level.",Biomass; Forest inventory; Non-destructive; Northeast India; Tree allometry; Tripura,2023,64,3,10.1007/s42965-022-00280-8,0564-3295,19,147,298,1893,6,NA,250,10,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
TROPICAL ECOLOGY,Assessing response of microarthropod populations to four edaphic factors in a humid subtropical forest in the sub-Himalayan alluvial plains,"Soil samples were collected monthly from a forest in the sub-Himalayan alluvial plains. The influence of four major edaphic factors on the abundance fluctuation of microarthropod assemblages were investigated. Soil temperature and organic carbon exhibited significant (p < 0.05) negative and positive correlations respectively with the abundance while the soil moisture and pH appeared of less importance. Four edaphic factors collectively can explain from 37.1 to 53.7\% abundance fluctuation as the multiple regression analyses indicated. Result of stepwise regression substantiated the observations made in correlation analysis. Relatively high temperature in the region appeared to be the reason for significant negative correlation, fluctuations of organic carbon were parallel to the monthly waves of abundances, sufficient soil moisture and narrow range of variation of pH appeared to account for their relatively inconspicuous impact.",Physicochemical parameters; Soil microarthropods,2023,64,3,10.1007/s42965-022-00242-0,0564-3295,19,139,131,942,2,NA,250,10,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
TROPICAL ECOLOGY,Bioclimatic modelling of Lantana camara invasion in the Shivalik landscape of Western Himalaya,"Spatial modelling has been an essential tool for predicting and mapping the suitable areas of a species' habitat. Ecological modelling was performed using 744 sampling locations to predict the potential habitat for the invasive plant Lantana camara in the lower Shivalik region of the Western Himalaya, India. The modelling engaged nine bioclimatic, four topographic, one land-cover, and two soil parameters that are known to be ecologically important for the species. Precipitation of the warmest quarter, mean temperature of the wettest quarter, precipitation of the driest quarter, and river flow accumulation contributed to the model. The predicted area for the invasion was classified into high, medium, and low potential areas. We identified nine potential hot spots based on species occurrence over a 2300 km(2) area to determine where immediate intervention is necessary to prevent the spread of Lantana camara.

Observations of birds at Tasik Kenyir and Setiu recorded a total of 297 individuals consisting of 26 families from 64 species. This study estimated that the diversity of birds at Tasik Kenyir (H' = 3.6) was higher compared to Setiu (H' = 2.9). However, the density of birds at Setiu (52.05 +/- 9.09 SE individuals/ha) was higher than Tasik Kenyir (37.56 +/- 10.28 SE individuals/ha). Ten feeding guilds of birds were identified in this study; insectivore, nectarivore, frugivore, omnivore, carnivore, granivore, insectivore-nectarivore, insectivore-frugivore, insectivore-granivore and frugivore-granivore. This study has provided valuable information on the bird assemblage and the understanding on the distribution of birds at Tasik Kenyir and Setiu.

TROPICAL ECOLOGY,Economical and ecological realization of Joint Forest Management (JFM) for sustainable rural livelihood: a case study,"In India, Joint Forest Management (JFM) programme was first introduced in the year 1972 at Arabari forest range in West Bengal with the collaboration of local community and forest department for the protection of reserve forest and improvement of rural livelihood. Subsequently, in 1990 the JFM programme was further extended at nearby Bhadutola forest range of Paschim Medinipur (West Bengal, India). The evaluation of this programme with respect to ecological and economic indicators has not been done. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of JFM scheme in two sites and also assess the ecological impacts of such programs. Applying relevant research methods like focus group discussion (FGD), standard of living index (SLI), livelihood dependence index (LDI) and measurement of forest dependency, the effectiveness of JFM project has been assessed for the sustainable forest management. The ecological impacts were calculated using the value coefficient method through implied for ecosystem service functions. The results showed that the forest dwellers of Arabari forest range are getting more benefits like different non-timber forest products (NTFP) than Bhadutola forest range community. It is stated that around 85\% respondents are highly satisfied with the implementation of JFM project. In the recent years, the standard of living index (SLI) of almost sixteen villages under JFM project has been significantly improved. The ecological impact for both the forest ranges clearly shows a positive effect on the ecosystem service values through food production, raw materials, genetic resources, climatic regulation and soil erosion control strategies. The Arabari forest range has shown more positive changes in ecological services function than the Bhadutola forest range. Therefore, this model needs to be applied effectively in different vulnerable forest ranges of tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world for sustainable forest resource conservation as well as improvement of livelihood of forest dwellers.",Ecological impact; Forest dwellers; Forest fringe people; Forest products; Livelihood; Standard of living,2023,64,2,10.1007/s42965-022-00275-5,0564-3295,16,117,303,2055,6,NA,250,10,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
TROPICAL ECOLOGY,Effects of elevated ultraviolet-B on the floral and leaf characteristics of a medicinal plant Wedelia chinensis (Osbeck) Merr. along with essential oil contents,"Wedelia chinensis (Osbeck) Merr. is a perennial thermotolerant bioherbicidal plant species spread in tropical and subtropical regions. The impacts of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on the floral morphology, stomatal characteristics, biochemical properties and essential oil content in leaves have not been investigated in medicinally important ornamental plants like W. chinensis. The present study has evaluated the growth, its leaf, stomatal, and floral characteristics, photosynthetic pigments, various metabolites as well as the essential oil content of W. chinensis under ambient and elevated (ambient + 7.2 kJ m(-2) d(-1)) UV-B (eUV-B) radiation. UV-B exposure stimulated the growth of the test plant indicating the greater chances of its survival under harsh conditions which could be beneficial for ecological sustainability. The leaf thickness, wax deposition, and metabolites such as phenol, proline, anthocyanin, and flavonoids were significantly increased under eUV-B, while the reverse trend was observed for the specific leaf area (SLA) and photosynthetic pigments. Adaxial stomatal density (34.2\%) and abaxial stomatal pore surface (146.1\%) was also increased; however, the opposite trend was found in abaxial stomatal density (48.6\%) and adaxial stomatal pore surface (41.5\%). The floral characteristics were positively influenced by the eUV-B. However, yield loss in the form of essential oil content by 39.9\% was recorded under eUV-B. Based on GC-MS analysis, an increase in mono-, di-, tri-terpenes, and fatty acids were observed, while sesquiterpene and other aliphatic hydrocarbons showed a reduction under eUV-B treatment. Moreover, alpha-Pinene, beta-Caryophyllene, beta-Thujene, beta-Myrcene, alpha-Phellandrene, L-Limonene, Germacrene D, Bicyclogermacrene, delta-Cadinene, Spathulenol, and Shyobunol were identified as the major components of the essential oil. The study concludes that exposure of UV-B radiation was directly beneficial for the floral morphology and unable to aggravate any morphological damage, the protective pigments, and antioxidants which played a strong defensive role in UV-B tolerance. Whereas, UV-B radiation exposure is deleterious to the plant's commercial importance in terms of yield of essential oil.",Essential oil; Floral morphology; Leaf characteristics; Stomatal characteristics; Secondary metabolites; UV-B radiation,2023,64,2,10.1007/s42965-022-00270-w,0564-3295,23,160,309,2262,6,NA,250,10,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Population, behavior and conservation status of the northern pig-tailed macaque (Macaca leonina) in the Inner-line reserve forest, Assam, India","The Northern pig-tailed macaque is listed as Endangered in India and vulnerable globally. In this study, we assessed the status and behavioral activities of Northern pig-tailed macaque (Macaca leonina) in the Inner Line Reserve Forest (ILRF). Population study was conducted through complete count method. A total of 29 individuals were found in three separate troops. We studied the activity profile of the species following a focal female individual of a selected troop and have obtained information on the anthropogenic threats and other conservation issues in the forest. Eight behavioral activities (viz., feeding, resting, locomotion, playing, grooming, vocalization, agonistic and mating) were recorded both in the summer and winter seasons. The activity budgets of the Northern pig-tailed macaque varied with the seasons and most of the times were spent on locomotion followed by feeding, resting, playing, vocalization and other three behavioral activities. During winter, over three-fourth of the time was spent on four major activities such as locomotion (31.7\%), feeding (25.1\%), resting (14.3\%), and vocalization (9.7\%). Although, time spent on locomotion (25.0\%) was also highest in summer, however, time spent in resting (24.6\%) and playing (15.6\%) increased in the season than the time spent in feeding (15.0\%). Potential threats were identified through questionnaire surveys of the people inhabited in and around forest. Multistage sampling method was used to select the villages at first and then respondents from the selected villages. One-fourth of the respondents constitute 159 of the total 637 household and additional 51 respondents comprising elder person, hunter and forest staff. As per peoples' perceptions, the main threats faced by the macaque were timber logging (44.90\%), followed by cultivation (30.96\%), harvesting of non-timber forest product (8.88\%), hunting (6.34\%), illegal trade/poaching (5.83\%) and forest fire (3.04\%).

TROPICAL ECOLOGY,Soil organic carbon and its labile pools as modulated by soil microbes under different land use practices in Typic Ustochrepts,"Rainfed lower Himalayas are being faced by soil degradation due to change in land use practices which in turn influence the carbon (C) inputs into the soil and microbial activities. A study was carried out to evaluate the labile organic C pools, soil enzymes and microbial indices in the dominating land use practices of the region. There were six land uses practices viz. forestry, agroforestry, silvipastoral, horticulture, agro-horticulture and agriculture. Soil samples were collected from three depths 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 cm for the labile C pools and the microbial activities were studied for 0-15 cm soil layer. The labile organic C pools viz. permanganate-oxidizable carbon (POXC), microbial biomass C (MBC), cold water extractable organic carbon (CWEOC) and carbohydrate carbon (CHO-C) content were significantly higher in soils under forestry (1.46 g kg(-1), 0.227 g kg(-1), 80 mu g g(-1), 389 mu g g(-1), respectively) and silvipastoral (1.15 g kg(-1), 0.193 g kg(-1), 70.7 mu g g(-1), 379 mu g g(-1), respectively) land uses and was lowest in soils under agriculture (0.88 g kg(-1), 0.115 g kg(-1), 56 mu g g(-1), 310 mu g g(-1), respectively). The labile C pools decreased with the increase in soil depth and the decrease being higher in soils under forestry. The microbial quotient (qmic) decreased on moving from forestry to other land uses and the decrease was highest in soils under agriculture by 38.6\%. However, the metabolic quotient was highest in soils under agriculture (0.175 mu g CO2-C day(-1) mu g biomass C-1) and lowest in soils under forestry (0.128 mu g CO2-C day(-1) mu g biomass C-1). The metabolic potential was highest in soils under agroforestry (0.046 mu g TPF h(-1) mu g C-1). Principal component analysis identified qmic and MBC as the most dominant and reliable indicators for the assessment of soil quality under different land uses.

We consider the changes suffered by the diversity of tardigrades in Santa Rosa city (Argentina) under different intensity of vehicular traffic (high, medium and low), evaluating whether there are biotic and abiotic factors that can influence the structuring of their communities. Moss and lichen samples were extracted and studied, and different environmental variables, microhabitat, and substrate were measured. Eight species were recorded. Habitat with high vehicular traffic contained the highest tardigrade abundance; while low vehicular traffic had the highest species richness. The assemblages of the three urban communities were different, with a strong dominance of three species: Milnesium quiranae, Ramazzottius oberhaeuseri and Macrobiotus kristenseni. Milnesium kogui turned out to be an indicator species for high vehicular traffic community. Ordination analysis showed a nesting pattern in the studied urban habitats, showing a high turnover of species in the high vehicular traffic community, while in medium vehicular traffic community a high nesting. There was a high loss of species in habitat with low vehicular traffic, while in the habitat with medium and high vehicular traffic there was a high turnover of species. The observed nesting pattern could be explained by the loss of microhabitat due to the replacement of urban trees.",Beta diversity; Biotic homogenization; Interspecific association; Lichen; Moss; Urban Ecology,2023,26,2,10.1007/s11252-022-01303-x,1083-8155,16,120,213,1455,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
URBAN ECOSYSTEMS,"Modeling the spatial distribution of multiple ecosystem services in Ilam dam watershed, Western Iran: identification of areas for spatial planning","The main purpose of current research is to quantify multiple Ecosystem Services (ESs) for the Ilam dam watershed, Western Iran. In this sense, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) was applied to quantify water yield, sediment retention, and habitat quality, and Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) to model recreation for the current landscape (here 2021). Due to the inevitable exchanges between different types of ESs, in this study, Getis-ord Gi {* statistics were also used to describe the characteristics of service bundles spatial variation. This tool is used to measure spatial clusters - i.e. hotspots and coldspot -within the grid, which helps prioritize conservation measures. The results show that changes in water yield are mainly influenced by changes in precipitation, sediment retention and other actions of multiple factors such as Land use/cover (LULC) type, precipitation and temperature, while changes in recreation and habitat quality have the most dominant influence by LULC type. Moreover, the results of the spatial ESs bundle indicate that the hotspots show high value for a wide variety of services, which are occupied by high forests and grassland proportions. Otherwise, the ESs coldspots bundle has shallow values for most of the services. The low percentage of current hotspots indicates the difficulty of obtaining multiple ESs from one area, suggesting a protective priority to stop the loss of various services. Given that the increasing demand for ESs has put a lot of pressure on natural ecosystems, politicians and urban decision makers need to focus on the sustainable use of ecosystems so that the supply of ESs is not disrupted. Hence, this research can be crucial as detailed instructions to raise politician's awareness and design a policy on ESs.",Ecosystem Services; Hotspots; coldspots; InVEST; ROS model; Ilam dam watershed,2023,26,2,10.1007/s11252-022-01297-6,1083-8155,20,146,282,1822,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
URBAN ECOSYSTEMS,An improved method for the identification and setting of ecological corridors in urbanized areas,"Ecological corridors are an effective tool for mitigating the fragmentation of habitats and populations. Due to limited space in highly urbanized areas, identifying the suitable width of urban ecological corridors (UECs), while taking ecological, social, and economic benefits into account, is important. However, the identification of UEC range is subjective and imprecise in existing studies and practices. To solve this problem, an impact index system for UEC width was established, and a simulation and evaluation model for determining the suitable construction width of UECs developed. The objective of this study is to reflect the dynamic quantitative relationship between the relevant impact factors and suitable UEC widths, and to propose clear and quantitative width suggestions as well as corresponding functional positioning and construction approaches for UECs in different environments. To eliminate the probable constraints brought by the overconfidence results, this study also grouped the simulation results into six flexible ranges, thus providing a specific width for an individual UEC as a benchmark, while also presenting UECs with a construction reference that accepts variation within a given range for specific environments and local situations. Our improved method for the identification of UEC width in rapidly urbanized areas promotes a completer and more dynamic path for UEC planning and design, and the conclusions can provide effective support for landscape and urban planning decisions.",Urban ecological corridor; Corridor width; Simulation and evaluation model; Functional positioning; Highly urbanized area,2022,NA,NA,10.1007/s11252-022-01298-5,1083-8155,14,96,220,1517,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

We found an aquatic insect richness loss of 78\% in urban impacted streams. Urbanization extent within a watershed was strongly related to pollution and water quality decline, and aquatic insect community composition shifts to less diverse assemblages.

Grey infrastructure is made up of buildings or built-up area, generally characterized by imperviousness of the surface. The complexity of urban green and grey infrastructure and their interactions co-define the quality of urban life and the ecological value of urban areas. Using conventional dichotomies by separation into ``urban{''} and ``rural{''} contexts does hardly allow to comprehensively assess the situation in rapidly urbanizing environments of the Global South. We present an unsupervised remote sensing-based approach that integrates 3D information to objectively categorize the complexity of green and grey infrastructure. Using the rural-urban interface of Bengaluru, India, as a case example, we distinguished five categories that describe the composition and configuration of green and grey infrastructure, where three variables served as indicators for categorization into five clusters. We argue that such integrated 3D assessment of green and grey infrastructure is particularly useful for understanding and classifying ``rurban{'' environments, where a distinction between urban and rural is often no longer possible.

There has been increasing attention to the need for evidence-based, integrated rat management and surveillance approaches because rats can compromise public health and impose economic costs. Yet there are few studies that characterize rat distributions in sewers and there are no studies that incorporate the complexity of sewer networks that encompass multiple sewer lines, all comprised of their own unique characteristics. To address this knowledge gap, this study identifies sewer characteristics that are associated with rat presence in the city of Seattle's urban sewer system. We obtained sewer baiting data from 1752 geotagged manholes to monitor rat presence and constructed generalized additive models to account for spatial autocorrelation. Sewer rats were unevenly distributed across sampled manholes with clusters of higher rat presence at upper elevations, within sanitary pipes, narrower pipes, pipes at a shallower depth, and older pipes. These findings are important because identifying features of urban sewers that promote rat presence may allow municipalities to target areas for rat control activities and sewer maintenance. These findings suggest the need to evaluate additional characteristics of the surface environment and identify the factors driving rat movement within sewers, across the surface, and between the surface and the sewers.",Urban; Rat; Rattus; Sewer,2022,25,6,10.1007/s11252-022-01255-2,1083-8155,11,69,205,1420,4,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
URBAN ECOSYSTEMS,Detecting nestedness in city parks for urban biodiversity conservation,"Urbanization has been a global phenomenon producing great environmental and ecological challenges including species composition shifts in urban areas. To evaluate the interaction networks of the inhabitant metacommunities in urban parks, we applied the nestedness analysis using ecological survey data of birds, reptiles, frogs, and butterflies among 16 parks in Taipei City of Taiwan and identified critical environmental factors for biodiversity conservation. Results found significant nestedness of the metacommunities among these parks, which indicated strong interaction networks and the importance of urban parks for sustaining these metacommunities. In addition, various types of land use had different effects on the species incidence of birds, reptiles, frogs, and butterflies. It demonstrates that landscape design should consider the taxonomic differences in the development of conservation guidelines. Results also showed that the area of parks and the area of woodlot in the park were critical elements for the nested structure. Nonetheless, abundant bird generalists were found to be highly related to the area of buildings within parks, distance to forests, rivers, and the neighbouring parks. Moreover, the exotic species were found to affect the interaction networks of native species. However, based on the current information, we cannot confirm the actual effects of the exotic species on the native biotasassemblages. Reptiles and frogs appeared to be more easily threatened by land development and habitat fragmentation due to their lower vagility. In this regard, we suggest that conservation action should focus on preserving green space with large areas and constructing green corridors, creating crucial elements, and increasing the vertical complexity in the parks for species with various vagilities. We believe these strategies can help reduce the impact of urbanization to retain healthy interactions and connections of metacommunities among habitats for effective biodiversity conservation in urban areas.",Biodiversity conservation; Community ecology; Park; Land-use; Nestedness; Urbanization,2022,25,6,10.1007/s11252-022-01272-1,1083-8155,9,70,290,2035,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Accumulation and toxic effects of boron-containing drugs in SW-620 models,"According to the World Health Organization, colorectal cancer is one of the three leading causes of death among other tumors. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising method for the treatment of oncological diseases. It is an experimental method of radiation therapy which is based on the capture reaction of a thermal neutron by an isotope B-10 and results in the B-10(n, alpha)Li-7 fission reaction. The high linear energy transfer from alpha particle and Li-7 nucleus has a short path length, thus the energy released is limited to the size of one cell. Previously, BNCT was actively used to treat patients with glioblastoma, melanoma, head and neck cancer, and other malignant neoplasms of various localization. The aim of this work is to determine the safe concentrations of boronphenylalanine (BPA) and sodium borocaptate (BSH) drugs for the SW-620 cell line and to assess the B-10 biodistribution after administration of these compaunds to immunodeficient SCID mice with heterotopic SW-620 xenografts. To evaluate the possibility of using BNCT as a therapy for patients with colorectal cancer, we carried out preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies on the model of human colorectal adenocarcinoma SW-620. Firstly, the cytotoxicity of boron compounds BPA and BSH at B-10 concentrations of 10-1280 mu g/ml was investigated using MTT test. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles of humane treatment of animals in compliance with the directive of the European Community (86/609 / EEC) and correspond to the principles of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH USA, No 85-23, rev. 1985). To determine the toxicity of BPA and BSH in standard dosages, drugs were intravenously injected into the retroorbital sinus: BPA at a concentration of 350 mg/kg and BSH at 100 mg/kg. The control group of animals were injected intravenously with sodium chloride 0.9\%. After 2 months of observation planned euthanasia was done, organs (kidneys, liver, lungs, brain and heart) were sampled for pathomorphological study. Biodistribution of B-10 in the tumor and organs of interest was performed on mice with SW-620 heterotopic xenograft. Boron containing drugs were injected at the dosages described earlier intravenously into the retroorbital sinus. Euthanasia was performed 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after injection, tumor tissue, blood, brain, liver and kidneys were sampled. The boron concentration was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP AES). As a result of the MTT test, we revealed that incubation of SW-620 cells with BPA and BSH for 24 and 48 hours at B-10 concentrations of 10-320 mu g/ml had no cytotoxic effect. When incubated for 48 hours with BPA at a concentration of 320 mu g/ml, survival rate did not differ significantly from control. The maximum safe concentration for BSH can also be considered 320 mu g/ml of B-10, since the cell survival in the experimental groups was 96 and 95.5\% for 24 and 48 hours of incubation with the drug, respectively. The first significant cytotoxic effects were noted during incubation with both boron-containing drugs at a B-10 concentration of 640 mu g/ml. For the BPA group, the percentage of survived cells was 65 (incubation for 24 hours) and 51 (48 hours), BSH had less cytotoxic effect: cell survival decreased to 87\% and 80.5\% at points 24 and 48 hours, respectively (See Fig. 1). Intravenous administration of BPA at a concentration of 350 mg/kg and BSH at a concentration of 100 mg/kg to SCID mice turned out to be safe: no pathological reactions were detected within 2 months of observation, all animals were alive. According to the pathomorphological study, no macroscopic and structural changes in the organs were found (See Fig. 2). The biodistribution of B-10 was assessed in SCID mice with subcutaneous xenografts SW-620 after intravenous administration of boron drugs at standard concentrations. As a result of the analysis, we found out that after intravenous administration of BPA at a safe dosage, the maximum concentration of B-10 in the tumor was recorded at the time points of 1 and 2 hours (8.0 and 8.7 mu g/g, respectively). In this case, the concentration ratio of B-10 in the tumor and blood samples was determined as 0.6 for the 1 hour point and 1.7 for the 2 hour point. We also demonstrated that the kidneys were the organ with the highest boron accumulation throughout the experiment (See Fig. 3). Thus, the time point of 2 hours can be considered potentially the most suitable for BNCT, but the concentration of boron in the tumor tissue is not sufficient. For BSH the maximum concentration was recorded at the time point of 1 hour (5.7 mu g/g). The liver, kidneys and blood contained the highest concentration of B-10 (See Fig. 4). Thus, apparently, further investigations on increasing the dose of the drugs and choosing different ways of boron agents administration can increase the accumulation of B-10 by the tumor and reduce its concentration in the surrounding tissues and blood. The use of additional drugs that improve the penetration of boron into the tumor may also be effective and should be taken into account.",boron neutron capture therapy; human colon adenocarcinoma SW-620 cell line; BSH; BPA,2021,NA,55,10.17223/19988591/55/6,1998-8591,10,73,844,5192,4,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Assessment of the relationship between chlorophyll content and biogenic elements in large lowland resevoirs,"In the second half of the 20th century, with increased rates of eutrophication, universal quantitative relationships between the content of biogenic elements and chlorophyll (Chl) were obtained, which serves as a marker of algae biomass, as well as an indicator of the trophic status of water bodies. Most of these studies were performed on lakes, however, the patterns and ratios found for lakes were not always observed in reservoirs, young ecosystems with high development dynamics. Long-term studies of phytoplankton productivity are carried out in the reservoirs of the Upper Volga. These studies have shown that a direct relationship of Chl with total nitrogen (N-tot) and phosphorus (P-tot) is rarely found and is at low correlation coefficients. A more successful attempt was to indirectly assess this relationship using the ratios of Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot, which was named ``phytoplankton response{''} (Vinberg, 1987) corresponding to the term ``efficiency{'' (Kalf, Knoechel, 1978). Our first data on Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot in the Upper Volga reservoirs refer to 1980-1990 (Mineeva and Razgulin, 1995; Mineeva, 1993; Mineeva, 2004). At present, new data have been obtained, which have made it possible to follow long-term trends in the development of phytoplankton in the reservoirs of the Upper Volga in connection with the availability of biogenic elements under variations in the trophic status of the reservoirs. Samples were collected in August 2015-2018 at 26 stations in three large reservoirs of the Upper Volga (56 degrees 51'-58 degrees 22'N, 35 degrees 55'-38 degrees 25'E): Ivankovo, Uglich and Rybinsk reservoirs. Chlorophyll content was determined by the fluorescence method (Gol'd et al., 1986) in integral water samples taken from the surface to the bottom. Data on biogenic elements obtained at the same time by Dr Irina Stepanova are given in our joint publication (Mineeva et al., 2021). The standard software packages for a personal computer were used for statistical processing (calculation of mean values and standard error of the mean (M +/- m(M)), correlation and variation coefficients, regression equations and graphing). In this research, we revealed that nutrient content in the Upper Volga reservoirs varied within similar limits, the average N-tot/P-tot ratio was the same, and the average values of P-tot and N-tot decreased in Rybinsk reservoir. Chl content was typical of the summer phytoplankton maximum in the Upper Volga reservoirs (See Table 1). P-tot content did not change much in Ivankovo and Uglich reservoirs, but in Rybinsk reservoir it increased in 2015 and decreased in 2016. The more stable content of N-tot decreased a little in the cool 2017. Chl concentrations of 20-30 mu g/L obtained in Rybinsk reservoir in 2015 and 2018, in Uglich reservoir in 2017 and in Ivankovo reservoir in 2015 correspond to the eutrophic category; concentrations of 35-52 mu g/L (Rybinsk reservoir in 2016, Uglich reservoir in 2015, 2016 and 2018, Ivankovo reservoir in 2016-2018) - to hypertrophic category, and only in 2017 in Rybinsk reservoir did they decrease to a moderately eutrophic level of 13 mu g/L (See Fig. 1). It was found out that under these conditions Chl content per unit of biogenic elements varied in a wide range: Chl/P-tot from 0,03 to 2,13, Chl/N-tot from 2,55 to 123, with maximum values in the highly eutrophic Shosha reach in Ivankovo reservoir (August 2018). Chl/N-tot slightly differed in Ivankovo and Uglich reservoirs, but increased in Rybinsk reservoir; Chl/P-tot decreased in the range of Ivankovo, Uglich and Rybinsk reservoirs (See Table 1). Most of both ratios belong to narrower limits: 0.10-0.50 for Chl/P-tot (67\% of all values) and 10-40 for Chl/N-tot (51\%) (See Table 2). The average Chl/P-tot ratio for the entire data set is 0.43 +/- 0.03, and Chl/N-tot is 29.8 +/- 1.9 with variation coefficients of 77.0 and 63.9\%. The interannual changes (See Fig. 1) show that all the maximum ratios were obtained in 2016, while the minimum in Ivankovo reservoir was in 2015, in Rybinsk reservoir in 2015 and 2017 and in Uglich reservoir in 2017 and 2018. Our results demonstrate that both ratios correlate with each other (See Fig. 2), as well as with the Chl content (See Fig. 3). The correlation of both ratios with Chl weakens in Ivankovo reservoir, probably due to the abundant development of macrophytes. We can observe the same in all reservoirs in the cool 2017 with a decrease in Chl(Cya)n (the abundance of cyanoprokaryotes) and an increase in the proportion of Chl(Bac) (the abundance of diatoms). Both ratios are insignificantly dependent on hydrological factors as well as on P-tot and N-tot content, but the situation can change in individual reservoirs and in different years of observation (See Table 3). As it was demonstrated, both ratios increase with the growth of trophy estimated by Chl. They do not significantly differ in mesotrophic and moderately eutrophic waters, but become much higher in eutrophic and highly eutrophic waters, indicating a more efficient consumption of nutrients in the latter. At the same time, P-tot and N-tot change little along the Chl gradient (See Table 4). Chl/P-tot decreases with the increase in P-tot and grows slightly with the increase in N-tot; Chl/N-tot does not change over the entire range of P-tot and N-tot; but both ratios vary along the gradient of N-tot/P-tot (See Table 5) that serves as an indicator of the biogenic limitation of phytoplankton and a factor regulating the development of algae. A retrospective analysis shows significant interannual fluctuations of both ratios in Rybinsk reservoir and a tendency to increase them in Uglich and Ivankovo reservoirs (See Fig. 1). Thus, Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot ratios are useful for analyzing the relationship between the development of phytoplankton and nutrient supply that is necessary in order to assess the efficiency of their use and their availability to algae cells. The results obtained allow us to conclude that phytoplankton in the Upper Volga reservoirs is less sensitive to the presence of nitrogen and more dependent on phosphorus.

VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Changes in anti-erosion resistance of irrigated grey Cinnomanic soils of the dry subtropical zone of Azerbaijan depending on the age of irrigation,"The dry subtropical zone of Azerbaijan is located in an erosion-hazardous zone, and irrigation erosion manifests itself on an area of more than 255 thousand hectares. The damage caused by irrigation erosion to the agriculture of the republic is manifested not only in the destruction of the soil structure, but also in the removal of nutrients from the soil. At the same time, the patterns of change in the anti-erosion resistance of grey Cirmomanic soils /Luvic Calcisols /Luvic-Calcic Kastanozems (according to the classification of the USSR), grey Cinnamonic soils (according to the classification of Azerbaijan), (on WRB (2014)-Haplic Kastanozems / Haplic Calcisols) in the dry subtropical zone of Azerbaijan, depending on the age of irrigation, are diverse and not fully studied. Therefore, conducting research in this direction and assessing the antierosion resistance of grey Cinnamonic soils is relevant for Azerbaijan. The aim of this research is to study the changing of the anti-erosion resistance of irrigated grey Cinnomanic soils in the foothill and plain areas of the dry subtropical zone of the republic, depending on the age of irrigation. Based on the results obtained, the place of grey Cinnomanic soils in the international classification system WRB (2014) was determined. The research was carried out on grey Cinnomanic soils of heavy loamy and light clayey granulometric composition of the foothills and plains of the dry subtropical zone of different irrigation periods, in the territories: Grey Cinnomanic (virgin soils) - Beylagan (39 degrees 46'02.2 `' N, 47 degrees 36'13.3 `' E) and Yevlakh region (40 degrees 60'67.75 `' N, 47 degrees 17'02.71 `' E); Newly Irrigated Grey Cinnamonic (20-25 years old) - Agdash region (40 degrees 63'24.62 `' N, 47 degrees 49'11.92 `' E) and Geokchay region (40 degrees 37'10.5 `' N, 47 degrees 44'29.5 `' E); Irrigated Grey Cinnamonic (about 100 years old) - Bilasuvar (39 degrees 48'36.49 `' N, 48 degrees 43'35.24 `' E), Yevlakh (40 degrees 4434.18 `' N, 46 degrees 96'51.13 `' E), kshu (40 degrees 55'39.53 `' N, 48 degrees 35'04.18 `' E), and Aghstafa region (41 degrees 06'11.17 `' N, 45 degrees 28'07.32 `' E); For a Long Time-Irrigated Grey Cinnamonic (about 300 years old) - Bilasuvar (39 degrees 44'25.56 `' N, 48 degrees 42'52.72 `' E) and Beylagan region (39 degrees 76'45.13 `' N, 47 degrees 59'13.50 `' E). The research methods are comparative-geographical (geographical patterns of distribution of these soils according to the granulometric competition and humus content of the arable horizon) and comparative-analytical. On the plots, soil sections were laid, a morphological description was carried out, soil samples were taken from the genetic horizons (Field guide of soils in Russia (2008), FAO. Guidelines for soil description (2006), IUSS Working Group WRB. World Reference Base of Soil Resources 2014, update 2015, Kailas and Tanzybayev (2001)). The anti-erosion resistance of soils was determined by the bottom erosion flow rate-according to Kuznetsov MS. (1981), the water resistance of the aggregates - by methods of dry and ``wet{'' aggregate analysis according to Savvinov, the specific gravity of the solid phase - by the pycnometric method, the granulometric compotition - by the pipette method, soil density - with a drill according to the generally accepted method (Arinushkina, 1970; Vadyunina and Korchagina, 1986]. The value of the protrusions of soil roughness was determined by the ratio Delta = 0.7 (d) over barw, where (d) over barw is the weighted average diameter of the water-resistant aggregates. The value (d) over barw was calculated based on the results of the structural analysis of the soil by the Savvinov method at the initial moisture content W (Grigoryev and Makkaveev, 1979), the content of total humus - according to Tyurin, modified bu Nikitin, cellulolytic activity - by application method for the decomposition of cotton canvases (Kazeev, Kolesnikov and Valkov, 2003). Depending on the age of irrigation, we revealed changes in the morphological profile of soil and qualitative indicators of physical-chemical properties of grey Cinnamonic soils during cultivation. in newly irrigated grey Cinnamonic soils, the cultivated layer (25-30 cm thick) is not fully formed, new arable (A1-22-27 cm) and subsurface horizons (A2-15-16 cm) have been formed and are somewhat compacted, the structure is deteriorated, the level of carbonate and gypsum horizons is lowered. The profile of irrigated soils differs sharply from virgin and newly irrigated soils, has a clear colour differentation; a cultivated layer is formed (thickness - 52-56 cm), the arable horizon is A1-25-28 cm, subsoil - A2-24-26 cm, the illuvial-carbonate horizon is poorly expressed, down to 96-101 cm. Long time-irrigated (irrigation-accumulative) soils under the influence of long-term irrigation with turbid waters and constant cultivation have lost the signs of zonal primary soils and acquired a special type of soil profile - a monotonous grayish-brownish colour, uniformity of profile and composition, a fully formed cultivated layer with a thickness of 65-70 cm; burried horizons are found at a depth of 61-83 cm. A distinctive feature of the irrigated and irrigation-accumulative (long-irrigated) variants of grey Cinnamonic soils - an increase in the microaggregates content, a high content of physical clay (60.8-64.3\%), which, when compared with the non-flush type of water regime (virgin), causes not very high humus content of the upper (0-25 and 25-50 cm of soil) horizons (2.29 and 1.78\% humus), their weak resistance to the destructive action of water (See Tables 2 and 3). The content of water-resisant aggregates >0.25 mm in layers (0.25 cm) of the soil in comparison with virgin (54.08\%) decreases to 35.83\% in newly irrigated, in irrigated - to 38.23 \% and in irrigation-accumulative (long-irrigated) - up to 40.40\% (See Table 4); the highest values of the coefficient of variation of density (CV = 13.54), with a standard deviation (SD = 0.161) are observed in newly irrigated soils (See Table 5). A high bottom erosive flow rate was noted in virgin soils is 0.070-0.072 m/s, somewhat less - in irrigated (0.050-0.063 m/s), in long-irrigated (irrigation-accumulative) (0.048-0.050 m/s) and in newly irrigated soils - 0.048-0.049 m/s (See Table 6). The highest value of porosity, with a solid phase density of 2.65-2.67 g/cm(3), is noted on non-irrigated (virgin) soils (49-55\%), in long-irrigated (irrigation-accumulative) soils, it decreases to 47-49\%, and on irrigated at a solid phase density of 2.66-2.77 g/cm(3) corresponded within the permissible values (51-52\%) (See Table 6). The values of the weighted average diameter of water-resistant aggregates decreased from virgin to newly irrigated and to long-irrigated (irrigation-accumulative) soils (from 0.670.74 mm to 0.27-0.31 mm) (See Fig. 1). The highest value of the ratio of anti-erosion resistance to erosion flow velocity was observed for virgin grey Cinnamonic soils (0,0710 +/- 0,102 m/s). The maximum average height of roughness protrusions was noted in long-irrigated (irrigation-accumulative) soils (0.27 mm), then irrigated (0.25 mm), and the smallest - in newly irrigated (0.19 mm) soils (See Table 7). We revealed that depending on the age of their irrigation, the anti-erosion resistance of grey Cinnamonic soils, as the bottom erosion flow rate and anti-erosion resistance decrease, can be arranged in the following row: virgin soils -> irrigated -> longirrigated -> newly irrigated. Based on the results obtained, we determined the place of grey Cinnamonic soils in the international classification system WRB (2014): Virgin soils - Saturated gley calcareous heavy loamy - Duric Gleyic Calcic Kastanozems (Loamic); Newly irrigated Grey Cinnamonic (20-25 years old) - Powerful new irrigated calcareous heavy loamy Grey Cinnamonic - Someric Calcic Kastanozems (Loamic); Irrigated Grey Cinnamonic (about 100 years old) - Powerful cultivated irrigated calcareous heavy loamy - Someric Kastanozems (Anthric, Loamic); For a long time-irrigated Grey Cinnamonic (over 300 years old) - Powerful gley cultivated for a long time irrigated calcareous heavy loamy Grey Cinnamonic - Gleyic Petrocalcic Kastanozems (Anthric, Loamic).","Grey Cinnamonic soils/Luvic Calcisols/Luvic-Calcic Kastanozems (according to the classification of the USSR); grey Cinnamonic soils (according to the classification of Azerbaijan); (on WRB (2014)-Haplic Kastanozems/Haplic Calcisols); the age of irrigation; irrigation erosion; humus; water-resistant aggregates; erosion resistance; Duric Gleyic Calcic Kastanozems (Loamic); Someric Kastanozems (Anthric, Loamic); Gleyic Petrocalcic Kastanozems (Anthric, Loamic)",2021,NA,56,10.17223/19988591/56/2,1998-8591,22,146,1271,8302,11,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Comparative analysis of shape variation in the cone scales of Larix dahurica and L. cajanderi (Pinaceae),"Geometric morphometric analysis of shape variation in the cone scales of two closely related larch species, Larix dahurica Laws. (=Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr) and L. cajanderi Mayr, was carried out. The data on the taxonomy and distribution of L. dahurica and L. cajanderi are contradictory. The taxonomic status of L. cajanderi has been confirmed by the genetic and morphological studies performed in Russia and based on considerable evidence, but the species has not been recognized internationally, being considered as a synonym of Larix gmelinii var. gmelinii. In the systematics of larch, morphological characters of the generative organs are mainly used as diagnostic markers, among the most important being the shape variation of the cone scales. The aim of this study was to test geometric morphometrics as a tool for analyzing differentiation of L. dahurica and L. cajanderi in the shape of their cone scales. Characterization of shape variations in cone scales using geometric morphometric methods consists in digitizing points along an outline of scales followed by analysis of partial warps, describing individual differences in coordinates of the outline points. We studied the populations of L. dahurica from Evenkia and the Trans-Baikal region and six L. cajanderi populations from Yakutia and Magadan Oblast. In each population, we analyzed samples of 100-150 cones collected from 20-30 trees. Scales taken from the middle part of the cones were scanned using an Epson Perfection V500 Photo. On the scanned images, outline points were placed with a TPSDig program (Rolf, 2010), using angular algorithm (Oreshkova et al., 2015). The data were processed and analyzed using Integrated Morphometrics Programs (IMP) software (http://www.canisius.edu/similar to sheets/morphsoft.html, Sheets, 2001), following the guidelines on geometric morphometrics in biology (Pavlinov, Mikeshina, 2002; Zelditch et al., 2004). Initial coordinates of the scale landmarks were aligned with the mean structure for L. dahurica and L. cajanderi cone scales using Procrustes superimposition in the CoordGen6 program. PCA based on covariances of partial warp scores was applied to reveal directions of variation in the shape of the cone scales. The relative deformations of the cone scales (PCA scores) were used as shape variables for statistical comparisons of these two larch species with canonical discriminant analysis. Morphotypes of the cone scales were distinguished in L. dahurica populations by pairwise comparison of samples from trees in the TwoGroup6h program using Bootstrap resampling-based Goodall's F-test (Sheets, 2001). Samples from the trees in which the cone scales differed significantly (p < 0.01) were considered to belong to different morphotypes. Morphotypes distinguished in L. dahurica populations were compared with the morphotypes that we had previously determined in L. cajanderi populations. The composition and the frequency of occurrence of morphotypes were used to determine phenotypic distances between populations (Zhivotovskii, 1991). Multidimensional scaling matrix of the phenotypic distances was applied for ordination of larch populations. In this research, we revealed differentiation of L. dahurica and L. cajanderi using geometric morphometric analysis of the shape variation of cone scales. The results of PCA of partial warp scores exposed four principal components, which account for 90\% of total explained variance in the shape of the cone scales in the two larch species. Graphical representations of these shape transformations in the vector form characterized directions of shape variability in scales corresponding to the maximum and minimum values of four principal components (See Fig. 2). PCA-ordination of the larch populations revealed some difference in the shape variation of the cone scales in L. dahurica and L. cajanderi (See Fig. 3). The results of canonical discriminant analysis of relative deformations of scales showed differentiation of the populations of the two larch species (See Fig. 4). Eleven morphotypes were identified in L. dahurica cones from Evenkia and nine morphotypes in the Ingoda population, three of the morphotypes being common for both populations (See Fig. 5). The shape of L. dahurica cone scales varied from spatulate to oval and their apical margins from weakly sinuate to distinctly sinuate. The Trans-Baikal population was dominated by scales with obtuse (truncate) and rounded apexes. The obtained morphotypes were compared with 25 cone scale morphotypes previously distinguished in the Yakut and the Magadan L. cajanderi populations (See Fig. 3). Four similar morphotypes of cone scales were revealed in the North-Yeniseisk population of L. dahurica and the Yakut populations of L. cajanderi. The differences between them in the populations of the two larch species were nonsignificant (p > 0.01). All morphotypes of cone scales from the Ingoda population of L. dahurica differed significantly from L. cajanderi cone scale morphotypes. The results of multidimensional scaling phenotypic distance matrix calculated based on the similarity of morphotypes of L. dahurica and L. cajanderi populations were consistent with the results of their differentiation based on relative deformations of scales obtained using canonical discriminant analysis (See Fig. 4 and Fig. 7). In spite of the differences in the shape of the cone scales between the North-Yeniseisk and the Trans-Baikal populations of L. dahurica, they both differed from L. cajanderi populations. Thus, phenotypic analysis confirmed differentiation of these two larch species. Despite the similarities between a number of morphotypes, the Yakut L. cajanderi populations were differentiated from L. dahurica populations. Significant differences were noted between intraspecific groups: between L. cajanderi populations from Okhotsk-Kolyma Upland and Yakutia and between L. dahurica populations from Evenkia and the Trans-Baikal region (See Fig. 4). The similarities between species and intraspecific differences may be attributed to the ongoing processes of hybridization and species formation in the region where the ranges of the larches overlap with the ranges of L. czekanowskii Szafer and L. dahuricax L. cajanderi hybrids. Geometric morphometrics can be used as an effective tool for analyzing differentiation of L. dahurica and L. cajanderi in the shape of their cone scales.

VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Comparative evaluation of the effect of resveratrol and carnitine on the full transcriptomic profile of liver tissue in mice with different sensitivity to the development of alimentary obesity,"Specialized food products and biologically active food supplements enriched with minor biologically active substances are considered as a useful supplement in the treatment of obesity and other nutrition-dependent diseases. Biologically active substances of food can have a complex effect on the expression of a large number of genes, which can affect the results of a therapy. The aim of the study was to analyze the nutrigenomic mechanisms of the effect of biologically active substances - 1-carnitine and resveratrol on the expression of liver genes of DBA/2J mice and DBCB tetrahybrid, differing in genotype and sensitivity to the development of diet-induced obesity, using the method of full transcriptomic profiling of liver tissue. We carried out the experiment on male DBA/2J mice and the hybrid of the 2nd generation DBCB, obtained by crossing 4 lines of mice (DBA/2J, BALB/c, CBA/lac and C57Black/6J). Mice for the experiment were obtained from Stolbovaya nursery, Federal State Budgetory Scientific Institution Scientific Center of Biomedical Technologies of the Federal Medical-Biological Agency (Moscow region, Russia). We worked with animals in accordance with international recommendations (Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes adopted on September 22, 2010; Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. Eighth Edition / Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals; Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (TEAR); Division on Earth and Life Studies (DELS); National Research Council of the National Academies. Washington: The National Academies Press. 2011). The mice were divided into four groups with an equal number of 8 individuals. During 65 days, animals of the 1st (control) groups received a balanced semi-synthetic diet and purified drinking water, the 2nd groups received a high- carbohydrate and high-fat diet with a high fat content (30\% by of dry matter of the diet) and replacing drinking water by 20\% fructose solution, 3rd groups - high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet with the addition of resveratrol at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight, 4th groups - high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet with the addition of 1-carnitine at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight. Full transcriptome analysis was performed using the Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (Agilent Technologies, USA) on SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8860K Microarray Kit microarrays. Differential gene expression was expressed as base 2 logarithm of increasing or decreasing fluorescence (log 2 FC) compared to control groups, separately for DBA/2J and DBCB mice. Chip scan data and calculation of differential expression values were exported to the ``R{''} IDE and bioinformatics analysis was performed with quantile normalization and further analysis in the limma package. The packages AnnotationDbi, org.Rn.eg.db, pathview, gage, gageData were used to identify metabolic pathways among the genes, metabolic pathways and functions of biological systems presented in the international database Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and to visualize them. To visualize the results at all stages, the standard ``R{''} graphics and additional packages ggplot2, ggrepel, and gplots were used. Liver morphology was studied by light microscopy after staining with hematoxyline-eosine (See Fig. 1). We revealed differential expression for at least one of the intergroup comparisons in the amount of vertical bar log2FC vertical bar >= 0.5 (towards both enhancement and attenuation) and at a p-value <= 0.05 for 415 transcripts, of which 311 were identified with proteins or RNA with a known function (See Tables 1-3). Consumption of a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet was reflected in differential expression of 62 genes in DBA/2J mice and 97 in DBCB mice. In DBA/2J mice fed on a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet, supplementation with resveratrol and 1-carnitine caused a differential expression of 26 genes each. At the same time, only 2 genes (Pklr; Tkfc) responded to resveratrol and 1-carnitine in mice of this strain. In DBCB tetrahybrid mice, resveratrol consumption corresponded to differential expression of 147 genes, and 1-carnitine consumption corresponded to 221 genes. 61 genes from DBCB mice responded to both supplements, and the number of genes simultaneously targeted by high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets, resveratrol and 1-carnitine was 10 (See Fig. 2). The gene expression profiles in DBA/2J and DBCB mice formed two separate clusters, the differences within which, determined by the composition of the diets, were less significant than the interstrain differences (See Fig. 3). Differential expression values in DBCB and DBA mice responding to HFCD and both supplements correlated negatively (See Fig. 4). The consumption of a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet in DBA/2J mice resulted in significant changes in 4 metabolic pathways, and in DBCB mice, in addition, in 5 more metabolic pathways. Resveratrol consumption did not cause significant changes in DBA/2J mice, and in tetrahybrid mice it affected mmu04512 ECM-receptor interaction. L-carnitine supplementation caused significant changes in mmu00830 Retinol metabolism only in DBCB mice (See Table 4). Consumption of a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet produced similar changes in the mmu00830 Retinol metabolism pathway in both mice (See Fig. 5). In metabolic pathway mmu03320 PPAR signaling pathway DBA/2J and DBCB mice showed positive differential expression of the PPAR gamma gene and negative Scd1. At the same time, only DBCB mice in this metabolic pathway are characterized by activation of the RXR gene expression and suppression of FABP, and the direction in changing Cyp4a1 in both mice is opposite (See Fig. 6). Changes in the metabolic pathway mmu00590 Arachidonic acid metabolism characterized by the imbalance in the expression of Cyp4a and Cyp2 isoforms, which are responsible for the synthesis of various hydroxy and epoxy derivatives of arachidonic acid, is characteristic only of DBCB mice (See Fig. 7). Thus, the experiments performed revealed both a certain similarity and differences in the response of the transcriptome of DBA/2J and DBCB mice to the consumption of a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet, resveratrol and 1-carnitine. The mechanisms that determine the direction of changes induced in the transcriptome of mice (and in coupled phenotypic changes) are, apparently, in the intervention of the studied dietary factors in key metabolic pathways, such as the PPAR signaling pathway, the metabolism of retinoids and eicosanoids. The data obtained indicate the importance of an adequate choice of a in vivo model of obesity and metabolic syndrome in preclinical studies of biologically active substances, in diet therapy and the enrichment of specialized food products with them.",transcriptome; gene expression; biologically active substances; mice; obesity,2021,NA,54,10.17223/19988591/54/5,1998-8591,28,192,1031,6856,5,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,DNA polymorphism and genetic diversity of the oak lace bug (Corythucha arcuata Say) population in Krasnodar Krai,"One of the directions of insect population genetics is the study of the variability of the genetic structure of populations, which includes the assessment of genetic diversity, DNA polymorphism and genetic similarity of the studied objects. This makes it possible to judge the flow of genes, i.e. exchange of genetic material within a population or between populations, and determine the degree of their genetic differentiation, i.e. they represent different populations or one population, and in this case, they are intrapopulation groupings. The aim of this work was to study the molecular genetic structure of local populations of the oak lace bug C. arcuata in Krasnodar Krai using RAPD markers to assess their genetic similarity. We carried out the studies in the territories of the invasive distribution of the oak lace bug in Krasnodar Krai in 2020. The object of the research was a sample of insects (n = 20) from the areas of oak lace bug in the forest park zones of Krasnodar, Tikhoretsk, Krymsk and Sochi. The total number of samples examined was 240. We collected C. arcuata bugs on model trees of English oak (Quercus robur L.). The selection of trees was 10 oak trees from each locality. Isolation of DNA from whole insects (adults), amplification RAPD-PCR (random amplified polymorphic DNA) and electrophoresis were carried out according to the method we had developed earlier (Kil, 2009). Amplification was performed in 25 mcl reaction mix containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0; 50 mM KCl; 3.0 mM MgCl2; 50 mu M of each dNTP; 0.8 mu M primer; 0.5 U Taq polymerise and 20 ng DNA. We evaluated DNA polymorphism of the studied samples from the population of bugs using three primers highly specific for the DNA of the oak lace bug: OPA07, OPA09, OPA18 (See Fig. 1 and Table 1). We assessed genetic diversity and genetic similarity using the Nei and Shannon information indices with the help of POPGENE computer program (version 1.31) (Yeh et al., 1999). The statistical significance of the differences between the mean values for the sample was determined by the Student's (-test (p < 0.05). Molecular genetic analysis of C. arcuata revealed high levels of DNA polymorphism and genetic diversity in the oak lace bug population and the absence of significant differences between the samples for these parameters (See Table 2). The studies have shown that the closest in genetic terms are the samples from Tikhoretsk and Krymsk (genetic identity (GI) = 0.998; genetic distance (GD) = 0.003), and the most genetically distant from others are the Krasnodar and Sochi intra-population groupings (GI = 0.942; GD = 0.06) (See Table 4). This was also demonstrated by the cluster analysis of data (See Fig. 2). Genetic diversity, estimated by Nei index, within four geographic samples (Hs = 0.275) was 93.2\% of the total genetic diversity in the lace bug population (Ht = 0.295) (See Table 3). This indicates a significant level of gene flow between intra-population groupings (Nm = 6.98), which prevents their differentiation. The low value of the coefficient of genetic differentiation (Gst = 0.07) indicates that only 6.8\% of the total genetic variability of the population is accounted for by the variability between intra-population groupings. Based on this, we can conclude that the analyzed insect samples represent intra-population groupings from one population of oak lace bugs, C. arcuata.",Corythucha arcuata; insects; PCR; RAPD analysis; genetic variability; intra-population groupings,2021,NA,55,10.17223/19988591/55/3,1998-8591,17,112,554,3401,6,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Differentiation of larch (Larix spp.) climatypes in the Central Siberian forest-steppe provenance trial,"Forest conservation is one of the main problems in world forestry. Numerous forest fires and widespread fungal pathogens and pests have led to a significant decline in forest areas and biodiversity and the disappearance of valuable populations. The problem of forest conservation and regeneration became especially relevant at the beginning of this century because of increasing wood harvesting. In this case, genetic collections of woody species, including provenance trials, established at different times play an important role in gene pool conservation of the main coniferous species - the forest-forming species in Russia - and in basic and applied problems in the context of climate change and the growing conditions in biogeocoenoses. The special interest in larch research is associated with a wide range of factors, such as inter- and intraspecific differentiation, capability to adapt to stressful growth conditions and the ability to successfully transfer seeds over large distances for creation of plantations with special purposes. The aim of this study was to assess inter- and intraspecific differences in height growth, crown area and length using the example of future generations of different larch species representing different provenances in the provenance trial. We obtained material for this study, located in the provenance trial research plot `Pogorelsky bor' (56 degrees 22'06 `' N, 92 degrees 57'23 `' E) in the forest-steppe of Krasnoyarsk krai, in 2016. Live larch trees in the provenance trial were inventoried using the GIS complex `Field-Map'. The total number of inventoried trees was 1674. Nineteen provenances (climatic ecotypes) of various larch species (See Table and Fig. 1) were chosen for comparative analysis of height, crown area and crown length using a nonparametric method - the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test and Median test. The crown proportion of tree stems was assessed using median values. Trees with a diameter similar to that of the main sample (121-160 mm; 412 trees) and an alternative sample of trees with a wider diameter (181-220 mm; 291 trees) were chosen for comparative analysis. Such an approach enabled the assessment of different biometric traits of trees while accounting for diameter and similar growth conditions at the trial site. The number of trees in the main sample was 3 and 148 in the two provenances, whereas it ranged from 6 to 48 in the rest of the provenances. In this study, tree height (See Fig. 2) and tree crown length (See Fig. 4) differed between climatic ecotypes of different larch species in the forest-steppe provenance trial of the south Krasnoyarsk region. These differences were related to the origin of the climatypes. We found that larch climatypes from mountain regions showed lower tree height and crown length. We also found that descendants of larch that originated in climatically favourable areas or those connected to the hollows of southern Siberia and the Biryusa and Chuna river basins within the Pre-Sayan province, as well as representatives of the Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) and Chekanowskii larch (L. czekanowskii Szafer) from Chita Oblast, had greater tree height and tree crown length in the provenance trial (See Fig. 2 and 4). Therefore, the exploitation of these provenances for reforestation of the Krasnoyarsk forest-steppe may be reasonable and rational. Although the results obtained for 10-year-old trees (Iroshnikov, 1977) indicated that the height growth of the Petrovsk-Zabaikalski climatype (Chekanowskii larch) was lower than that of the Siberian and Dahurian larches, by the age of 50 years, it achieved a similar diameter and may be regarded as equal in height growth to the majority of representatives of the latter two larches in the forest-steppe zone. Comparative analysis of samples with different diameters showed that, in general, climatypes were in the same tree height groups (See Fig. 1). Our results show that significant differences in tree height between climatypes are not an obligatory condition for differences in crown length. Tree crown length has its own separate developmental strategy, which is genetically associated with the environmental conditions of the place of origin. The climatype from the highlands with the lowest hydrothermal coefficient of place of origin (the Tes-Khem climatype from Tyva) had the shortest crown length. The ratio of crown to full stem length of the Tes-Khem climatype was 18\%. High crown lengths were found for larch climatypes from the hollows of southern Siberia and for representatives of the Dahurian larch from Amur Oblast (the Zeya climatype). The northernmost climatype from the southern taiga (the Motygino climatype, Angara river basin) had a crown length lower than that of the representatives of the Dahurian larch. The crown length proportion of the Zeya climatype (38\%, the highest median value of the samples compared) was 14\% higher than that of the Motygino climatype (24\%). Differences in crown proportion of more than 5\%-10\% were observed between a few larch climatypes. In general, natural differences between species could not be defined. In this study, significant differences between samples representing different larch species were only found for crown length. The Gmelin larch had a significantly higher crown length than the Siberian (p < 0.001) and Japanese (p < 0.05) larches. In contrast to the other traits studied, crown area did not significantly influence the difference between climatypes. The reasons for the absence of significant differences were the high variability of this trait in the majority of climatypes and the presence of extremes in some samples (See Fig. 3).",Larix; climate; adaptation; tree stem diameter; tree height; tree crown,2021,NA,56,10.17223/19988591/56/8,1998-8591,13,103,885,5696,6,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,"Estimation of genomic DNA damage in populations of the marsh frog (Pelophylax ridibundus Pallas, 1771) of the Belgorod agglomeration by DNA comet assay","Anthropogenic pollution of water bodies is a serious problem for the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems. The main sources of pollution of water bodies are wastewater, washouts from agricultural fertilizers, pesticides and roads. Many of highly persistent pollutants are dangerous mutagens and carcinogens. The disruption they cause to the DNA and RNA structure and properties of organisms can have long-term consequences and can affect the livelihood of future generations. Among existing DNA damage estimation methods, DNA comet assay is the most widespread due to its accuracy and reliability. In our study, the marsh frog (Pelophylax ridibundus Pallas, 1771) was chosen as an object of study. This species is adapted to life under anthropogenic influence and actively inhabits transformed biotopes. The aim of our work was to estimate the level of DNA damage by DNA comet assay of P. ridibundus inhabiting Belgorod city and its suburbs. We studied a total of 6 marsh frog populations, with collection sites differing in the degree of anthropogenic pressure (See Table 1 and Fig. 1), and we selected 5 individuals of P. ridibundus from each locality. The experimental animals were handled in accordance with international ethical standards. Animal liver was used as the material for the study and analysis was performed on the day of collection. Tissue was homogenized in phosphate-salt buffer (pH 7.5) containing 20 mMEDTA-Na2 and 10\% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at +4 degrees C. To precipitate large fragments, tubes were incubated for 5 mM at room temperature before transferring 1.5 ml of the top layer to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged in a 5415 R Eppendorf microcentrifuge (Germany) at 1000 g for 10 mM at +4 degrees C. The supernatant was removed and the cell precipitate was diluted in 1 ml of phosphate salt buffer cooled to +4 degrees C. To obtain microarrays, 60 mu l of cell suspension was mixed with 240 mu l of 1\% fusible agarose solution (t<42 degrees C). The lysis was performed for at least one hour at +4 degrees C (lysis buffer: 10mM Tris-HCl (pH 10) 2.5M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA-Na2 and 1\% Triton X-100 with 10\% DMSO). Electrophoresis was performed in a darkened room in Tris-EDTA-borate electrode buffer (TBE) for 20 mM at a voltage of 1V/cm. At the end of electrophoresis, the preparations were fixed with 70\% ethanol for 15 mM. The preparations were stained with SYBR Creen I dye, with subsequent analysis using a luminescent trinocular microscope MIKMED-2 of Lomo (Russia), with at least 100 cells analyzed from each preparation, which were divided into 5 types; cells in the state of apoptosis were counted separately (Durnev, et al., 2006). The degree of DNA damage was estimated using the Kruskel-Wallis criterion ({''}DNA comet index{''}) (Struwe et al., 2007; Filippov, 2014). To determine the statistical significance of differences between the studied populations we used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); statistically significant differences were considered at p < 0.05. According to the data obtained, in all studied populations, the mean value of the DNA damage index (DDI) did not exceed the first threshold of DNA degradation (See Table 2). This may indicate, on the one hand, the absence of high concentrations of genotoxic pollutants here (which is highly doubtful) and, on the other hand, the efficient operation of the reparative system of marsh frog. Nevertheless, the calculated DDI values made it possible to construct a gradational scale of DNA destruction level in the studied groups of frogs depending on the degree of pollution and proximity of residential and industrial buildings (See Table 2-4). Various chemical compounds from industrial production, particularly nitrogen compounds, are known to have genotoxic effects. Due to the lack of possibility to perform chemical analysis of water to identify concentrations of genotoxic pollutants, we analysed data on surface water pollution in some of the investigated locations from open literature sources. As a result of this analysis, we revealed the dynamics of surface water pollution. All investigated points by the mean value of the statistical DDI surpassed reliably the least polluted site ``Sevrukovo{''}, which is located in the green zone and at a considerable distance from urbanized areas (See Table 2-4). High values of DDI were fixed in a zone of industrial and multi-storey buildings, localities ``Seversky Donets{''} (DDI = 0.454) and ``Veselka{''} (DDI = 0.416). Exceeding maximum permissible concentration of nitrogen compounds is observed in the above mentioned rivers. Noteworthy is the fact that the highest value of the DDI (0.521) was recorded in the estuary of the Razumnaya River remote from the industrial part of the city ({''}Razumnoye{''}). It should be noted that in this locality there is the greatest number of damaged cells, including apoptosis (See Table 2, Fig. 2 and 3). The highest DDI value is due to the high level of pollutants, since the predominant part of the river is occupied by ``non-sewered{''} private low-rise buildings, as well as arable land. At the same time in the upper part of the river ({''}Sevryukovo{''}) due to the lack of obvious pollutants and the intensive current contributing to self-purification of the river, we recorded the minimum value of the DDI (0.057) and the absence of cells in the state of apoptosis. Thus, the present study revealed an increase in the degree of DNA destruction in populations of marsh frogs in the impacted areas of the city of Belgorod and its surroundings. At the same time, increased levels of toxic substances may contribute to a decrease in the viability of individuals of both analyzed species and other hydrobiont species, which will negatively affect the biodiversity of the region as a whole.",Pelophylax ridibundus; comet assay; urbanized area; genotoxic pollutants; bioindicator,2021,NA,55,10.17223/19988591/55/4,1998-8591,23,151,926,5805,5,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,"Features of regenerants morphogenesis and metabolism in vitro, obtained from different fragments of potato shoots","Micropropagation is one of the fastest ways of plant propagation. This method allows obtaining a large number of clones that retain all characteristics of the species and varieties of plants. Among the important problems of micropropagation of potato plants, two can be distinguished: the rate of microclones regeneration (rooting of microclones and the development of regenerants) in vitro and the value of the propagation factor (number of layers). The plant hormones auxins and cytokinins, whose content changes along the longitudinal axis of the plant, play a key role in the regeneration of cuttings. The aim of this research was to study the specificity of micropropagation, morphogenesis and metabolism of Solanum tuberosum L. regenerants in vitro, depending on the initial explants position in the plant. The objects of the study were plants of S. tuberosum L. of the mid-season cultivar Lugovskoy. During the experiment, cuttings (explants) taken from layers 3 and 5 of the shoot consisted of intemodes, buds and leaves. We chose apical cuttings containing a greater amount of endogenous auxins due to the spatial separation of the site of synthesis and the main action of these hormones in the plant as experienced clones. Cuttings from the middle of the shoot were those of control. We cultured cuttings on hormone-free solid agar 50\% nutrient medium Murashige-Skoog (MS) supplemented with 3\% sucrose and vitamins. The flux density of incident photons of the PAR was 200-230 mu mol/(m(2).s), with a 16-hour photoperiod and an air temperature of 20-22 degrees C. Luminescent white lamps TL-D 58W / 54-765 G13 (Philips, Poland) were used as a light source. The relative light intensity was measured using an AvaSpec-102/256/1024/2048 spectrometer version 6.2 (Avantes BV, Netherlands). During 3 weeks of culturing microclones in test tubes, we described the phenology of their regeneration. We assessed the formation of adventive roots (AdR) by the dynamics of changes in the number and length of AdR primordia. The formation of regenerants was assessed by the dynamics of changes in the number of layers and the length of shoots. At the end of cultivation on the 39th day, we removed the regenerants from the test tubes and determined their growth and biochemical parameters. We used the gravimetric method to determine the wet and dry biomass of the regenerants. We measured the leaf surface area using the Moticam 2300 software (Spain) on photographs taken with a digital camera. The intensity of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the content of free proline were measured in the leaves of the middle layers fixed with liquid nitrogen. The content of photosynthetic pigments was determined in the alcoholic extract. In the air dry material, the total content of flavonoids and anthocyanins was determined. We carried out the measurements using a Genesys 10S UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron, Germany). The significance of the differences between the samples was assessed using Student's t-test (p<0.05). Figures show data as the mean of the repetitions and their confidence interval (M +/- 1.96SEM). All experiments were performed in 20-40 (growth parameters) and five (physiological parameters) biological and three analytical replicates. We noted the emergence of roots in potato cuttings on the 4th-5th day. More active root formation and their elongation occurred after seven days of cultivation in apical clones, compared with clones obtained from the middle layer. By the 10th day of cultivation, the apical clones had formed seven roots, while the middle ones had four roots, their total length was 9.04 +/- 0.36 and 6.56 +/- 0.26 cm, respectively (See Fig. 1, A-B). In the cuttings of the middle layer, bud opening and growth of the first shoot internode started earlier than in the apical microclone (See Fig. 1, C-D). The manifestation of donor-acceptor bonds between organs during the formation of regenerants should be noted. The predominant growth of the root system in the apical microclone caused inhibition of the growth and development of the shoot. In the middle microclone, the opposite pattern took place: shoot growth prevailed when the root growth was inhibited. We studied the growth parameters of 39-day-old potato regenerants obtained from apical (AR) and medium (MR) shoot cuttings of potato mother plants (See Fig. 2, A). In AR, root volume, shoot length, number of layers, and the total leaf area increased by 25, 14, 11 and 20\% (p<0.05), respectively compared to MR (See Fig. 2, B-E). The regenerants had the same total dry biomass (See Fig. 2, F). However, the redistribution of dry matter between the organs in the plant was ambiguous. We showed that ARs had a 34\% (p<0.05) lower dry root mass relative to MR, but a 13.4\% higher shoot biomass due to the leaf surface. As a result, the shootto-root dry mass ratio was higher in AR compared to MR. In vitro potato regenerants showed predominantly heterotrophic growth since more active AR growth occurred against the background of a low content of all groups of photosynthetic pigments and the chlorophyll a I chlorophyll b ratio (See Fig. 3, E). We studied the physiological state of the regenerants by the biochemical parameters of the middle leaves. In AR leaves, the intensity of LPO relative to MR decreased by 22\% (p<0.05), which indicated the formation of a higher oxidative status in MR. AR has a reduced content of free proline by 28\% (p<0.05) compared to MR (See Fig. 3, A-B). The total flavonoids content in MR was twice that in AR (See Fig. 3, C). This could indicate a decrease in the intensity of their growth processes. The level of anthocyanins in the MR and AR did not differ. The data obtained show the ability of the initial hormonal status of microclones to change the sequence and intensity of their regeneration processes, including organogenesis, growth rate and plant metabolism. The use of apical micro-clones is especially important when it is necessary to increase the reproductive rate of plants. The mechanisms underlying the different rates of regeneration of microscopic cuttings taken from different layers of the S. tuberosum shoot are discussed.",Solanum tuberosum; regeneration; lipid peroxidation; antioxidants; photosynthetic pigments,2021,NA,55,10.17223/19988591/55/7,1998-8591,15,113,992,6181,5,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Floristic novelties in the Republic of Altai,"In the Republic of Altai, there are about 7 thousand lakes with a total area of more than 600 km(2) and most of them are practically unexplored. Despite the fact that botanical research has been carried out on the territory of the Republic of Altai for a rather long period and generalizing works have been published, the aquatic flora of the region has not been fully studied. This work presents a processed part of the data on floristic findings obtained during hydrobotanical research in lakes of the Altai Mountains. We completed the fieldwork in the first half of July 2018. 12 lakes located in Ust-Kanskii, Ongudayskii, Ulaganskii and Kosh-Agachskii districts, as well as several small roadside water bodies were surveyed by the route method using an inflatable boat. In the course of the work, we used hydrobotanical cat-rakes, a portable Garmin eTrex Vista navigator (with a GPS receiver), and a Pentax waterproof camera. Mineralization measurements were carried out in the surface layer of water using a Hanna HI 98130 portable conductometer-thermometer-pH meter. To determine the plants, we used an Altami PS0745-T stereoscopic microscope with a camera. Herbarium specimens were transferred to the NSK Herbarium of the Central Siberian Botanical Garden of the Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences.

VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Identification of sedentary and migrating graylings in the Yenisei River using scales,"The regulation of river flow by dams of hydroelectric power plants (HPPs) has a significant impact on the populations of migratory fish species, preventing their movement between the upstream and downstream sections. Violation of the level and thermal regime of the river in the downstream of the HPP can also lead to a modification of the migration process, both within the main channel and between the main channel and its adjoining system. It is assumed that after the construction of the dam of Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric power station, a significant part of the population of the Baikal grayling Thymallus baicalensis in the downstream section switched to a sedentary lifestyle. However, quantitative assessments of this phenomenon have not yet been carried out. The middle course of the Yenisei River in the downstream of the HPP is a specific watercourse with a smoothed seasonal amplitude of water temperatures and a high biomass of benthic invertebrates, up to 10-30 g/m(2). Such conditions provide an increase in the growth rate of grayling in the main channel of the Yenisei, and lead to the formation of the structure of its scales, which differs from fish from the tributaries of the Yenisei. An additional feature of the Yenisei in the downstream of the HPP is that the content of technogenic radionuclides, in particular, radiocesium, Cs-137, increased compared to the background levels, below the point of radioactive discharges of the Mining-and-Chemical Combine ROSATOM (MCC) located near the town of Zheleznogorsk (See Fig. 1). Thus, high growth rates, a unique structure of scales, and an increased concentration of radiocesium can be considered as markers of graylings that constantly inhabit the main channel of the Yenisei in the downstream of Krasnoyarsk HPP. Within the framework of this work, we, for the first time, attempted to assess the ratio of settled and migrated individuals of the Baikal grayling from the tributaries in the thermally altered section of the Yenisei on the basis of the structure of the scales. As a verification of the proposed marker, we used the linear dimensions of fish and the content of radioactive cesium in their tissues. A sample of 161 individuals of the Baikal grayling was used in this work. Fish were collected in the section of the main channel of the Yenisei near the mouth of the Kan River, near the village of Khloptunovo (56 degrees 28'05 `' N, 93 degrees 38'53 `' E) in July-November 2019. When working with animals, the authors followed the recommendations of Directive 2010/63 / EU of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Fork Length and total weight of fish were measured. Grayling scales taken in the lateral line region were photographed and then used to count the number of sclerites in the completed annual rings. The principle of differentiation of grayling individuals by their origin is based on previously obtained results on an increased number of sclerites on the scales of fish (primarily in the second annual ring) inhabiting a thermally altered section of the middle reaches of the Yenisei. Within the framework of this study, we assumed that individuals of grayling with more than 15 sclerites in the second annual ring of scales constantly inhabit the main channel of the thermally altered section of the Yenisei. Further, these individuals are designated by the term ``sedentary{''}. Individuals with a smaller number of sclerites, designated as ``migrants,{''} spent at least the second year of their life in tributaries. To measure the content of technogenic radionuclides, fish of the two indicated types were isolated from the total sample. In the pooled samples of sedentary grayling for each month, the number of individuals varied from 12 to 31 (total 125), in the samples of migratory ones - from 3 to 8 individuals (total 18). Samples were prepared from muscles taken from the axial skeleton of fish, dried and ashed in a muffle furnace at 450 degrees C. The content of gamma-emitting radionuclides in the ash samples was measured using a gamma spectrometer with a hyper-pure germanium detector GX2320 (Canberra). The spectra were analyzed using the Genie-2000 software (Canberra). The number of sclerites in the second annual ring of the studied grayling varied from 9 to 24. The share of individuals with 9 to 14 sclerites, and designated in our work as migrants, was 18.6\% of the entire sample (See Fig. 2). The highest percentage of migrating individuals was recorded in July (24\%); in August-September it was about 20-22\%, in October - 15\%, and in November such grayling was not found. To assess potential differences in the growth rates of sedentary and migratory fish, the samples were divided into groups by age and month of capture. The linear dimensions of the sedentary grayling aged 2-3 + were 3-5 cm higher (p < 0.05) than the linear dimensions of migrating fish in July-August (See Fig. 3). There were no differences in FL in 4+ year old fish in July, as well as in 3-year-old fish in September-October. Of the technogenic gamma-emitting radionuclides, only radiocesium was registered in the muscles of grayling ( Cs-137, half-life - 30.1 years). The content of Cs-137 in grayling muscles varied in the range of 0.9-7.2 Bq/kg. The maximum content of Cs-137 was noted in sedentary fish in August, which exceeded the content of this radionuclide in the sample of migrants six times (See Fig. 4). In the rest of the months, the samples of sedentary and migrating individuals contained a similar specific activity of Cs-137. In July, the content of radiocesium in the sample of migrating individuals was not measured. The content of radiocesium in the muscles of graylings caught in the background site of the Yenisei did not exceed the detection limits. Thus, for 2-3-year-old fish, caught in the summer period, the assumption about the differences in the growth rates and the content of radionuclides in the tissues of residential and migratory individuals was confirmed. To explain the absence of differences between individuals of the two strategies in other months, a temperature model of the distribution of grayling in the tributaries of the Yenisei was proposed. According to our assumption, when the water temperature rises to the physiological optimum (17-18 degrees C) in the lower and middle reaches of the tributaries in July-August, part of the local fish rises upstream, and part rolls down into the colder Yenisei (summer temperatures no more than 12 degrees C). It is during this period that the most dramatic differences between the Yenisei fishes and migrants can be diagnosed. By mid-late autumn, such differences are leveled, and the migrants themselves are scattered among the Yenisei fish (See Fig. 5). The reason for the increased content of Cs-137 in sedentary graylings in August is not clear to us, but, possibly, it is due to the dynamics of permitted radioactive discharges into the Yenisei, the frequency of which during the year is not known to the authors, since it is not published in the annual radioecological reports. Cesium, being a chemical analogue of potassium, behaves in the body of fish similarly to this biogenic element. The main deposits of cesium are found in fish muscles. When balancing the intensity of consumption and excretion of radiocesium, its content in the tissues of sedentary individuals reaches a stationary level, which we observed in September-November. The results of the work show that fish isolated from the general sample on the basis of a smaller number of sclerites in the second annual ring can indeed be considered migrants from tributaries. The approach we used reveals predominantly immature and first maturing individuals settling from tributaries, but is unsuitable for identifying sexually mature fish that carry out short-term intra-river migrations. In the thermally altered section of the Yenisei in the downstream of the HPP, tributaries can still make a significant contribution to the grayling population. In the area of the mouth of the Kan River, one of the largest tributaries of the middle Yenisei, the percent of migrants in the summer-autumn period of 2019 was about 20\% of the total grayling population. The need to separate sedentary and migratory individuals is important for obtaining homogeneous samples of grayling, which is traditionally used as a model object in analyzing the distribution of technogenic pollutants in the river, as well as for studying the nutritional value of grayling and environmental risks for the population associated with its consumption.",Thymallus baicalensis; seasonal migration; thermal regime; circuli; radiocesium; middle reaches of the Yenisei River,2021,NA,56,10.17223/19988591/56/7,1998-8591,12,85,1390,8597,6,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Induction of somatic embryogenesis in Siberian spruce (Picea obovata) in in vitro culture,"The biotechnology of somatic embryogenesis in in vitro culture is the most promising direction in the reproduction of conifers. The use of this technology makes it possible not only to massively propagate the best genotypes of trees, but also serves a model for studying the structural, physiological and molecular and genetic mechanisms of both somatic and zygotic embryogenesis in conifers. The main aim of this research was to obtain embryogenic cultures (ECs) producing somatic embryos and embryonic suspension mass (ESM) of Picea obovata. The studies were carried out in 2014-2019 on 30 Siberian spruce trees growing in the vicinity of the city of Krasnoyarsk. To detect genotypes competent for somatic embryogenesis, new donor trees were selected every year for the experiment. 3-10 cones were collected from each tree at different stages of embryo development: globular embryo (the first decade of July), the initiation stage cotyledons (second decade of July), the stage of developed cotyledons (third decade of July) and mature embryos (August). Sterilized explants (zygotic embryos at different stages of development) were introduced into in vitro culture on basic media DCR (Gupta PK and Durzan DJ, 1985), 1/2LN (Litvay JD et al., 1985), MS (Murashige T and Skoog F, 1962) and AI (Tretyakova IN, 2012). All media were supplemented with myo-inositol - 100 mg/L, casein hydrolyzate - 500-1000 mg/L, L-glutamine - 500 mg/L, sucrose - 30 g/L and agar - 7 g/L. Ascorbic acid at a concentration of 400 mg/L was used as an antioxidant. The level of growth regulators was: 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) - 2 mg/L and N-6-benzoaminopurine (BAP) - 1 mg/L. For the proliferation of the ESM, DCR and AI basic media containing 2,4-D (2 mg/L), BAP (0.5 mg/L) and sucrose (20 g/L) were used. The pH was adjusted to pH = 5.8. All culture medium and components were sterilized depending on their termolabile properties. Under aseptic conditions, embryos were removed from megagametophytes and inoculated into nutrient media, 10 explants per flask in 25 replicates. The cultures were incubated in the dark at 24 +/- 1 degrees C. Subcultivation to fresh nutrient medium was carried out every 14 days. To control the quality of cell lines (CL) during subculturing, we performed cytological analyzes using temporary preparations (3-5 preparations for each CL). We evaluated the quality of the embryogenicity of the cultures by the presence of even single structures with pronounced polarity - a globular embryo with a suspensor. The results of the study showed that the induction of callus cultures of Siberian spruce is influenced by such factors as the development stage of the explant, the nutrient medium and the genotype of the donor tree. The introduction of P. obovata immature zygotic embryos into in vitro culture at the stage of the globular embryo, both with megagametophytes and extracted from them, turned out to be ineffective. The induction of callus cultures in Siberian spruce was significantly reduced when mature zygotic embryos were introduced into the culture in vitro. The highest response of explants of Siberian spruce was at the stage of developed cotyledons (See Table 1). In the DCR medium, 90\% of explants formed callus (See Table 2). The mineral composition of the media did not significantly affect the induction of callus formation in Siberian spruce. The exception was the MS medium, in which callus cultures were formed only in 41\% of explants (See Table 2). The growth of callus cultures was most active in the DCR medium. After 6 months of cultivation, 15-32\% of calli remained viable (See Table 2). Cytological analysis of callus cultures showed that they include cells of different types (See Fig. 1 and 2). The first type of cells consisted of elongated cells reaching a length of 10 +/- 3 gm, others consisted of isodiametric cells with a diameter of 60 +/- 3.5 gm. The somatic embryo globule and embryonic tubes were formed from elongated cells. Isodiametric cells were actively dividing and forming callus. Only 3 cell lines (out of 300 cell lines) belonging to two donor trees had an active ability to proliferate. Globular somatic embryos were actively forming in these cell lines (See Fig. 3). An actively proliferating ESM was formed. Thus, we carried out a comprehensive assessment of the factors influencing the induction of somatic embryogenesis in Siberian spruce. The results obtained indicate that for the successful formation of somatic embryos, the determining factor is not only the choice of donor plants, but also the development stage of the explant. We found that the best stage in the development of zygotic embryos when introduced into in vitro culture of Siberian spruce is the stage of immature embryos with formed cotyledons, while the DCR, 1/2LN and AI nutrient medium supplemented with growth regulators (2.4-D and BAP) is optimal.",Picea obovata; in vitro; callus; embryogenic cultures; stage of explant development; nutrient medium; donor tree; somatic embryogenesis,2021,NA,54,10.17223/19988591/54/1,1998-8591,13,89,787,4897,8,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,"Influence of multiple deficiency of vitamins, calcium, magnesium and iodine on cognitive function in growing rats","Due to the prevalence of multiple deficiency of vitamins and some minerals among the population, as well as the role of micronutrients in maintaining cognitive functions, the aim of the research was to study the effect of combined deficit of vitamins and/or calcium, magnesium and iodine in the diet of growing Wistar male weaning rats on the manifestation of an unconditioned reflex and ability to learn in response to an electric shock. Mice for the experiment were obtained from Stolbovaya nursery, Federal State Budgetory Scientific Institution Scientific Center of Biomedical Technologies of the Federal Medical-Biological Agency (Moscow region, Russia). After a 5-day feeding on a complete semi-synthetic diet, rats with an initial body weight of 51.4 +/- 0.5 g were randomly (according to body weight and the results of the ``Elevated Plus Maze{''} test) divided into four groups (10-12 animals in each group). Subsequently, within 23 days, the animals of the control group (I) received a complete semi-synthetic diet, the rats of Group II (- Ca, Mg, I) were fed on the same diet, but with a 50\% reduction in the amount of calcium, magnesium and iodine in the mineral mixture, the rats of Group III (- Vit) received a diet containing 100\% of minerals with a reduced amount of vitamin mixture up to 20\% with the complete elimination of vitamin E from it. The animals of Group IV (- Vit, Ca, Mg, I) were kept on a diet simultaneously deficient in vitamins and mineral substances. The manifestation of the unconditioned reflex was studied in the ``Elevated plus maze{''} test before feeding the animals on experimental diets and on the 21st day of feeding. The behavior and memory of animals were evaluated in the test ``Conditioned reflex of passive avoidance{''} on the 7th day of feeding on experimental diets in response to electrocutaneous irritation of paws (current 0.4 mA, not more than 8 sec.) when entering the dark compartment (development of a conditioned reflex), on the 8th day a test of training (a memorable trace), and on the 21st day - an assessment of longterm memory. Pre-anesthetized with ether, the rats were taken out of the experiment by decapitation, and the content of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) was determined by HPLC, vitamins B-1 and B-2 were measured fluorimetrically in the whole lyophilized brain. In this research, we revealed, that throughout the experiment, the general condition of all animals (appearance and fur) and the body weight did not differ. Reducing the content of vitamins in the diet led to a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in the brain content of selectively measured vitamins B-1 and E at the end of the experiment (See Table 1), that indicated the development of micronutrient deficiency in them. Micronutrient deficiencies for 21 days did not affect the degree of anxiety of the growing rats, assessed in the ``Elevated Plus Maze{''} test. However, the rats from the groups deficient in vitamins (group - Vit and group - Vit, Ca, Mg and I) had a higher motor activity than the animals of the control group and the animals fed on a diet deficient in calcium, magnesium and iodine (group - Ca, Mg and I), which significantly less moved through the maze (See Table 2). In this research, we found out that on the 7th day of the development of micronutrient deficiency in rats the reproduction of the unconditioned reflex (photophobia) worsened (See Fig. 1). In the rats with vitamin deficiency (group - Vit), the time spent in the open compartments increased 3.0 times compared to the control, whereas in the rats with mineral deficiency (group - Ca, Mg and I) and combined deficiency (group - Vit, Ca, Mg and I) it increased 1.85 and 1.95 times, correspondingly (p < 0.05), while no differences were detected when playing a conditioned reflex 24 hours after training (See Fig. 1). In this research, a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in long-term memory have been discovered in the animals fed on a vitamin-deficient diet (group - Vit) and in the rats fed on a diet with simultaneously reduced levels of vitamins, calcium, magnesium and iodine (group - Vit, Ca, Mg and I). On the basis of the latent time of entry into the dark compartment after 24 hours and 2 weeks, we established that the memory deterioration was due to a decrease in the vitamin content in the diet, whereas the deficit of mineral substances did not affect these parameters (See Fig. 2). In this research, we revealed that multivitamin deficiency in rats exerted an amnestic effect and made a major contribution to impaired learning and long-term memory. This findings suggest the importance of adequate provision of the organism with all vitamins and mineral substances to maintain cognitive functions and memory.",Multiple micronutrient deficiency; conditioned reflex of passive avoidance reflex; vitamins; minerals; long-term memory,2021,NA,54,10.17223/19988591/54/4,1998-8591,16,113,789,4744,5,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Invasions of bird-dispersed shrub species in specially protected natural reservations of Saint-Petersburg and Leningrad Region,"The research deals with recent invasions of bird-dispersed shrubs in specially protected natural reservations of St.Petersburg and Leningrad Region. The results of bird-dispersed woody species inventory in 5 partial nature reserves and nature sanctuaries of the area (See Fig. 1), based upon the extensive phytocoenological research data of 2014-2018, are given (See Table 1). Out of the adventive shrub species listed, the two most aggressive invaders were chosen according to their constancy and abundance in natural forest communities. These are Lonicera nigra in Komarovskiy Bereg {[}Komarovo Coast] Nature Sanctuary and Amelanchier spicata in Lisinskiy {[}Lisino] Partial Nature Reserve. For this purpose, distributions of these species are traced along with different forest types they invade, paying attention to species constancy and projective cover in different layers of forest communities (See Tables 2 and 4). Values of intralandscape species activeness, based upon the proper releve sets, were also calculated for both aboriginal and adventitious plant species from different community types in each study area (See Tables 3 and 5). Lonicera nigra has never been detected as an invader before. It is presumably dispersed by robins, thrushes, and warblers, also by means of barochory and secondary hydrochory. The latter is proved by the occurrence of the oldest shrubs in riverine Norway spruce and Scots pine forests on the Littorine terrace of the Gulf of Finland within Komarovo Coast Nature Sanctuary. The results of secondary bird dispersal of this species are observed in sorrel spruce forests where the untypical low shrub layer is being formed (See Fig. 2). These plants are remote form brooks or drainage channels (See Table 2). L. nigra acts as one of the most active species in the sanctuary forest coenofloras studied (See Table 3). Nevertheless, floristic composition of these forest communities remains yet unchanged in its main features. The invasion of L. nigra in the sanctuary area was first mentioned in literature by NN Tzvelev in 2000 but it took place much earlier, as the ancestral plant specimens were likely to grow in a transplant nursery near the present-day sanctuary north-eastern border in the early XX-th century. According to Komarov Botanical Institute Herbarium (LE) data, the secondary area of L. nigra in Russia is restricted to several findings in the Karelian Isthmus. Amelanchier spicata, the June berry, listed among the most aggressive plant invaders in European Russia, is dispersed by thrushes along roads in forests and then invades sorrel and horsetail-peatmoss spruce and pine forests on southern-boreal watersheds in Lisino Reserve, often as a gap-filling species. It is less common and abundant in secondary birch and aspen forests. In contrast to Lonicera nigra, it is infrequent and never abundant in riverine forests (See Table 4), the fact probably explained by difference in prevailing bird distributor species. A. spicata is never found in feathermoss pine forests on fluvial-glacial sand as well as in dwarfshrub-peatmoss pine bog forests. The invasion of this species in the reserve area probably took place after 1984-1987 when the species was not registered in forest communities of the area according to the author's personal observations. In 2017, the activeness of A. spicata is low in all the forest types it inhabits, being compared to that of the dominant aboriginal species (See Table 5). As follows from the correlation analysis results, no one of the discussed invaders affects the projective cover of any of the native plant species in both protected areas significantly. Speaking of Amelanchier spicata, it is in fact far less aggressive than in the more southern areas of Central and Southern Russia where the species transforms forest communities actively and affects aboriginal field- and ground-layer plants negatively, even as far as to the extinction of some of the latter, as it is well-known from the literature on the subject. We are just at the beginning of the invasion process in the forests of the Russian North-West yet. The invasion of both species studied is likely to be connected with the climate change processes. The research reveals that a neglected adventive species, persisting long within a given area, may also suddenly become an aggressive invader (the case of Lonicera nigra). The invasion of adventive shrubs into the paludified forest communities, including those of the boreal peatmoss spruce forests which served as etalons of floristic stability quite recently, is also alarming.",Lonicera nigra; Amelanchier spicata; invasive plant species; ornitochory; partial nature reserves; nature sanctuaries; Lisino Partial Nature Reserve; Karelian Isthmus,2021,NA,54,10.17223/19988591/54/2,1998-8591,15,126,715,4594,8,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Monitoring the development of the oak lace bug (Corythucha arcuata Say) based on the use of atmospheric heat content,"In recent years, a negative situation has developed as a result of mass invasions of adventive pests on the lands of the forest fund, among which the oak lace bug Corythucha arcuata Say (Heteroptera: Tingidae) requires special attention. The pest poses a great danger to the survival and productivity of oak forests and forest plantations in the South of Russia. The existing methods of pest monitoring do not always reflect the real constants of the phenology of target objects, which leads to errors in determining the optimal timing of protective measures and a decrease in their effectiveness. Hence, research in the development of precision methods for phytosanitary monitoring of harmful species is an important problem of plant protection, especially biological. The study of the phenology and dynamics of the oak lace bug will allow optimizing protective measures, taking into account the most vulnerable phases of phytophage development and the timing of treatments. The aim of this study was to develop precision methods for monitoring the dynamics of the number and age structure of the oak lace bug population based on the use of the heat content of the atmosphere. The studies were carried out in the central (Krasnodar), northeastern (Tikhoretsk) and western (Krymsk) zones of Krasnodar Krai belonging to the temperate climatic zone, as well as the Black Sea zone (Sochi), located in the subtropical climatic zone. The choice of localities for the research was carried out taking into account the territories of invasive distribution of the oak lace bug and the differences in climatic conditions from moderate continental to subtropical. The calculation of the heat content (enthalpy) of air was carried out using a modified Ramzin nomogram (See Fig. 1). Phenological observations and counting of the number of C. arcuata bugs were carried out on model trees of English oak (Quercus robur L.) (See Fig. 2). The reference date was chosen empirically based on the use of heat content indicators that are different in terms of reference periods and corresponding to these periods (See Table 1). As a result of the studies carried out during 2018-2020, the actual dates of the onset of the phenophases of the oak lace bug and the corresponding enthalpy of air (the heat content) were determined (See Table 2). We calculated the amount of heat required for the emergence of the oak lace bug after winter diapause (140-145 kcal/kg air) and passing through the preimaginal stages of development from egg-laying (158-167 kcal/ kg), hatching of larvae (180-194 kcal/kg) before fledging of adults of a new generation (136-145 kcal/kg). The sum of effective temperatures (SET) was calculated according to the generally accepted method (Chernova, Bylova, 2004; Zamotajlov et al., 2009) (See Table 3). We have shown that the enthalpy of air is the most preferable indicator for assessing thermal characteristics for determining the timing of the appearance of overwintered individuals, the passage of phenophases of insects and the number of their generations in comparison with the sum of effective temperatures (See Table 2 and 3). We found that the number of generations of oak lace bug in the central, western and northeastern zones (temperate climatic zone) of Krasnodar Krai, which is directly dependent on the heat content of the air, was three, and in the Black Sea zone (subtropical climatic zone) there were four generations per seasonal cycle. To improve the reliability of predicting the timing of phenological phases of the oak lace bug, a method for monitoring phenophases of the pest based on calculating the heat content of the air has been developed, which can be used for practical purposes to optimize protective measures associated with the use of insecticides, growth and development regulators of insects, entomopathogens and entomophages in agricultural and forest cenoses. Thus, distribution, development rate, number dynamics and harmfulness of the species to the greatest extent depend on the ecological resource of the inhabited territory, determined by the enthalpy of the air. On the basis of enthalpy, the rate of passage of phenophases and the number of generations of the pest, which determine its invasive development in large areas, are reliably calculated.",Corythucha arcuata; insects; pests; phenology; generation; enthalpy; biological plant protection,2021,NA,54,10.17223/19988591/54/7,1998-8591,19,116,681,4293,7,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,"Mortality of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamark, 1819) depending on sex","The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is one of the most popular species forcultivation globally and is one of the most abundant mollusc species in the Black Sea. In recent decades, there have been changes in the sex structures of the Black Sea settlements of M. galloprovincialis, trending towards an increase in the number of males. However; data on the effects of male and female mortality on the sex ratio in the population of M. galloprovincialis are insufficient. Therefore, this study aimed to assess how sex impacts the mortality of M. galloprovincialis. Mussels with shell lengths of either 30 or 55 mm were selected during the mass spring spawning. A total of 580 specimens were collected for the study. The separation of molluscs by sex was performed individually for each specimen via temperature stimulation of spawning. Each mussel was labelled according to its sex. The mortality of the mussels was studied in natural and laboratory experiments. In the natural experiment, different-sized females and males were selected and placed in cages that were hung in polluted harbour water. After 6 months, the number of dead mussels was recorded. In the laboratory experiment, sex-labelled mussels were placed in aquariums. The laboratory experiment was terminated after the death of 50\% of the mussels. The mortality of females was found to be significantly higher than that of males. In the natural experiment, the mortality of females compared to males in the 55 mm size group was 23\% higher and 18\% higher in the 30 mm size group. In the laboratory experiment, the mortality of females in both size groups was 16\% higher than that of males. Therefore, it was established that one of the reasons for the increase in the number of males in the settlements of M. galloprovincialis in the Black Sea is the higher mortality rate of females compared to males.",Mytilus galloprovincialis; mollusc; aquaculture; pollution; Black Sea,2021,NA,55,10.17223/19988591/55/9,1998-8591,11,81,307,1868,5,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,no,yes,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Obtaining tree stand attributes from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data: the case of mixed forests,"Nowadays, due to the rapid development of lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), remote sensing systems of ultra-high resolution have become available to many researchers. Conventional ground-based measurements for assessing tree stand attributes can be expensive, as well as time- and labor-consuming. Here, we assess whether remote sensing measurements with lightweight UAV can be more effective in comparison to ground survey methods in the case of temperate mixed forests. The study was carried out at the Prioksko-Terrasny Biosphere Nature Reserve (Moscow region, Russia). This area belongs to a coniferous-broad-leaved forest zone. Our field works were carried out on the permanent sampling plot of 1 ha (100 x100 m) established in 2016. The coordinates of the plot center are N 54.88876 degrees, E 37.56273 degrees in the WGS 84 datum. All trees with DBH (diameter at breast height) of at least 6 cm (779 trees) were mapped and measured during the ground survey in 2016 (See Fig. 1 and Table 1). Mapping was performed with Laser Technology TruPulse 360B angle and a distance meter. First, polar coordinates of each tree trunk were measured, and then, after conversion to the cartesian coordinates, the scheme of the stand was validated on-site. Species and DBH were determined for each tree. For each living tree, we detected a social status class (according to Kraft). Also for living trees, we measured the tree height and the radii of the crown horizontal projection in four cardinal directions. A lightweight UAV Phantom 4 (DJI-Innovations, Shenzhen, China) equipped with an integrated camera of 12Mp sensor was used for aerial photography in this study. Technical parameters of the camera are available in Table 2. The aerial photography was conducted on October 12, 2017, from an altitude of 68 m. The commonly used mosaic flight mode was used with 90\% overlapping both for side and front directions. We applied Agisoft Metashape software for orthophoto mosaic image and dense point cloud building. The canopy height model (CHM) was generated with lidR package in R. We used lasground() function and cloth simulation filter for classification of ground points. To create a normalized dataset with the ground at 0, we used spatial interpolation algorithm tin based on a Delaunay triangulation, which performs a linear interpolation within each triangle, implemented in the lasnormilise() function. CHM was generated according to the pit-free algorithm based on the computation of a set of classical triangulations at different heights. The location and height of individual trees were automatically detected by the function FindTreesCHM() from the package rLIDAR in R. The algorithm implemented in this function is local maximum with fixed window size. Accuracy assessment of automatically detected trees (in QGIS software) was performed through visual interpretation of orthophoto mosaic and comparison with ground survey data. The number of correctly detected trees, omitted by the algorithm and not existing but detected trees were counted. As a result of aerial photography, 501 images were obtained. During these data processing with the Metashape, dense point cloud of 163.7 points / m(2) was generated. CHM with 0.5 m resolution was calculated. According to the individual-tree detection algorithm, 241 trees were found automatically (See Fig. 2A). The total accuracy of individual tree detection was 73.9\%. Coniferous trees (Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies) were successfully detected (86.0\% and 100\%, respectively), while results for birch (Betula spp.) required additional treatment. The algorithm correctly detected only 58.2\% of birch trees due to false-positive trees (See Fig. 2B and Table 3). These results confirm the published literature data obtained for managed tree stands. Tree heights retrieved from the UAV were well-matched to ground-based method results. The mean tree heights retrieved from the UAV and ground surveys were 25.0 +/- 4.8 m (min 8.2 m, max 32.9 m) and 25.3 +/- 5.2 m (min 5.9 m, max 34.0 m), respectively (no significant difference, p-value=0.049). Linear regression confirmed a strong relationship between the estimated and measured heights (y=k{*}x, R-2 =0.99, k=0.98) (See Fig. 3A). Slightly larger differences in heights estimated by the two methods were found for birch and pine; for spruce, the differences were smaller (See Fig. 3B and Table 4). We believe that ground measurements of birch and pine height are less accurate than for spruce due to different crown shapes of these trees. So, our results suggested that UAV data can be used for tree stand attributes estimation, but automatically obtained data require validation.",UAV; canopy height model; tree detection; mixed forests,2021,NA,54,10.17223/19988591/54/8,1998-8591,15,98,726,4698,4,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Occurrence and characteristics of Bacillus cereus group bacterial atmospheric aerosols in Novosibirsk region,"The microbial diversity of atmospheric bioaerosols involves microorganisms that can cause allergic and infectious diseases or toxic effects. They include bacteria of the Bacillus cereus group (B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. anthracis, B. mycoides, B. pseudomycoides, etc.), which can result in diarrhea, pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia, and other infectious diseases. Accordingly, monitoring the presence of Bacillus cereus group bacteria in aerosols is critical. However, practically no data exist on Bacillus cereus and other cereus-group bacteria in southwestern Siberia's poorly investigated atmospheric aerosol environment. Bacteria of the cereus group are capable of effective production of various biologically active compounds, with important implications for biotechnology; microorganism strains with new capabilities are being investigated. This study aimed to determine the occurrence and characteristics of B. cereus group bacteria in ground-level and high-altitude atmospheric aerosols in Novosibirsk region of southwestern Siberia, and to evaluate the biotechnological potential of the obtained microbial isolates. High-altitude atmospheric samples were collected over Karakan Pine Forest, approximately 50 km south of Novosibirsk, at altitudes of 7000, 5500, 4000, 2000,1500, 1000, and 500 m, by aircraft sounding. Boundaries of the aircraft flight path: 54 degrees 26'38 `' N, 82 degrees 30'47 `' E; 54 degrees 10'55 `' N, 81 degrees 44'00 `' E. Ground-level samples were collected at various sites in Koltsovo settlement, Novosibirsk region. Impingers with a flow rate of 50 L/min containing 50 ml of Hanks' solution were used for air sampling. The obtained aerosol samples were sown on a set of nutrient media and incubated at 28-30 degrees C and 6-10 degrees C. The titers of microorganisms in high-altitude and ground-level samples were determined in terms of 1 m 3 of atmospheric air. Standard microbiological methods were employed to study the phenotypic characteristics of the identified microbial isolates. Lipolytic activity was determined on yolk agar and LB agarized medium containing fatty acid esters with 0.01\% CaC1 2 . The substrates used were 1.0\% monolaurate (tween-20) and monooleate (tween-80). Amylolytic activity of the cultures was determined by their isolation on starch-ammonia agar, and proteolytic activity by their ability to hydrolyse milk gelatin and casein (Maniatis T et al., 1984). The ability to hemolysis was taken into account when cultures were plated on LB medium with the addition of ram's blood. Nuclease activity was studied on LB medium with the addition of Sigma DNA (USA) (Maniatis T et al., 1984). The content of plasmid DNA in the isolates was determined by screening according to Maniatis T et al. (1984). The capacity for RNAase secretion in culture medium (peptone - 9.27 g/l, yeast extract - 5 g/l, NaCl - 3.00; 10 ml of 50\% glycerin, 2 ml of 20\% glucose; pH 7.07.2) during cultivation of bacteria at 30 degrees C, for 18-24 h, was determined by the accumulation of acid-soluble products, formed upon hydrolysis of high-polymer RNA of yeast (1 mg/ml). Antibiotic activity of the studied strains was determined by cross-strics (Yasuda T et al., 1992) on LB medium at 37 degrees C. The following pathogenic test strains were used: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Candida albicans 620, Klebsiella pneumoniae B-4894, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella typhimurium 2606, and Shigella sonnei 32 (collection of FSBI State Research Centre Vektor of the Rospotrebnadzor). The genetic analysis of bacterial isolates was performed using PCR with specific primers on 16S rRNA. The calculation of the number of cultivated microorganisms in the samples was carried out according to the Kerber method {[}Bottone EJ, 2010], and the number of microorganisms was averaged over three parallels of the inoculated samples. The annual average numbers of cultivated microorganisms were calculated as a mean +/- the confidence interval at a significance level of 95\% of t-Student's (p < 0.05). Percentages of spore-forming cultured bacteria in aerosol samples varied significantly across the years of observation (1998-present): in high-altitude samples, the minimum and maximum were 0.5\% (in 2005) and 55\% (in 2011), respectively, and, in ground-level samples, the minimum and maximum were 0.1\% (in 2002) and 83\% (in 2016), respectively (See Fig. 1 and 2). Annual averages of total concentration of microorganisms ranged from < 1 to 5810 5 CFU/m(3). The number of cereus-group bacteria also varied significantly from sample to sample, with averages ranging from 0.01\% to 6.5\% of the total number of isolated microorganisms. A total of 2.025 bacterial isolates, of which 62 formed endospores, were isolated from ground-level and highaltitude aerosol samples collected during the predominance of south-westerly winds from Kazakhstan in autumn 2016, and were characterized by increased dust-component content. Spore-forming bacteria were identified as belonging to the genera Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Brevibacillus, Lysinibacillus, and some others. Both high-altitude and ground-level aerosol samples were shown to contain bacteria of the cereus group: Bacillus cereus (Bc) and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), Bt ssp. kurstaki, Bt ssp. galleriae subspecies; Bt strains with indefinite serotype were also found. Notably, Bacillus anthracis species were not found (See Table 1). Screening for enzyme secretion revealed Bt and Bc strains with pronounced proteolytic, phosphatase, lipolytic, and amylolytic activities in a medium pH range from 5.0 to 9.0 (See Table 2). An atypical strain of B. thuringiensis Cb-527, which demonstrates high production of RNase, was isolated. All strains demonstrated hemolysis capability, were multi-resistant to antibiotics (resistant to 6-15 drugs (See Table 3), and suppressed the growth of the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans, to varying degrees. The Bt Cb-527 strain, as well as several Bc strains, also effectively inhibited the growth of Gram-positive test strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. Gram-negative bacterial test strains were low-sensitive to the action of metabolites of the studied Bc and Bt strains (See Table 4). In high-altitude and ground-level samples of the studied atmospheric aerosols, bacteria of the cereus group belonging to Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis species were found in amounts ranging from 0.01 to 6.5\% of the total number of cultured microorganisms isolated under experimental conditions. The presence of aggression enzymes such as phospholipases, hemolysins, proteases, and nucleolytic enzymes typical of representatives of these taxa, was found. We isolated Bc and Bt strains with high levels of secretion of enzymes and metabolites that possess antibiotic activity; these strains are promising as producers. The Bacillus thuringiensis Cb-527 strain (with a pronounced secretion of the RNase complex) can be used for the development of anti-RNA-containing virus drugs. The isolated Bc and Bt strains demonstrated multiple antibiotic resistance, which confirms literature data on the increasing prevalence of polyresistance among the identified natural microbial isolates.",Bacillus cereus; Bacillus thuringiensis; atmospheric bioaerosols; spore-forming microorganisms; enzymatic; antibiotic activity,2021,NA,56,10.17223/19988591/56/3,1998-8591,13,108,1066,7263,6,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Populus suaveolens Fisch. morphology in the populations of the North-East of Russia,"The fragrant poplar (Populus suaveolens Fisch, section Tacamahaca Mill.) is a mountain-valley species inhabiting riverine alluvial deposits and confined to floodplain and first floodplain terraces of rivers from the upper Yenisei to northern Japan, Korea, Mongolia and China in the south to the Chukchi Peninsula in the north. Despite its wide distribution, it remains the least studied and almost unused to ``green building{''} even within its range. Data on intraspecific variability of P. suaveolens are fragmentary, and studies of the variability of species-specific traits at the population level are insufficient. Such trait as basal glands (glands from above at the junction of petiole and blade) has been recorded recently and only in one part of the range. As a consequence, there is no clear understanding of the scope of the taxon, the boundaries of its range and natural hybridization with neighboring species of the Tacamahaca section. Since hybridization introduces some difficulties in studying intraspecific variability in species of the genus Populus, it is of theoretical and practical interest to study variability in populations remote from its current zones. One of such regions of P. suaveolens range is Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, where it grows in the floodplains of rivers in periodically flooded areas, forming with Chosenia arbutifolia (Pall.) A.K. Skvortsov poplar-chosenia forests. The aim of this study is to characterize the variability of morphological traits of vegetative organs of P. suaveolens in populations of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. We studied P. suaveolens populations in 2020 in Bilibinsk district of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. The study area is characterized by a low-mountain relief: with increasing altitude of the terrain a change in vegetation belts is traced. Forest communities occupy river valleys and the lower parts of the slopes of hills. Poplar-chosenia forests grow on sandy-pebble substrates along the river floodplains in small strips. As our observations have shown, P. suaveolens is widely used in landscaping of settlements of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and Magadan Region. Three of the studied populations: ``Baimka{''}, ``Tallag{''} and ``Peschanka{'' are located at the latitude of the Arctic Circle in the floodplains of the eponymous rivers in the river basin Bolshoi Anyui. All of them are isolated from each other by mountains. The northernmost population ``Bilibino{''} is confined to the right bank of the Bolshoi Keperveem River (Maly Anyuy River basin) on the border of Bilibino, it is 200 km distant from the others. All populations were sampled in poplar-chosenia floodplain forests with varying degrees of anthropogenic transformation of the territory (Table 1). To exclude age variability, we collected herbarium material only from shortened shoots of the southern side of the middle part of the crown of reproductively mature trees. The tendency of balsamic poplars to form clones was taken into account, and repeated collections within a clone were carefully avoided. From each individual, fifteen fully developed, undamaged leaves were taken. The main morphometric traits, as well as the derivatives (indices) were measured on each leaf. A total of 1800 leaves were used for morphological study. We studied a complex of traits: blade shape, its apex and base, presence of basal glands, and petiole pubescence. Poplar-chosenia forests in the studied area grow in a narrow strip on alluvial sandy-pebble deposits in the floodplains of rivers (See Fig. 1). The stand formed by P. suaveolens is 12-14 m high, 16-20 cm in diameter; trunks are straight and with low taper. Bark in a lower part is oblong-cracked at the height of 1-1.5 m, above it is smooth and whitish-gray. The crown is usually compact, spreading in older trees; branches are of medium thickness. Clearance from dry branches is good. Leaf blades on shortened shoots are bent upwards at the edges and folded in the form of a ``boat{''} in all the studied plantings. This is probably due to the absence of stomata on the upper side of the blades and this ``folding{''} facilitates transpiration. Perhaps it is an important adaptation in the subarctic conditions of the region. P. suaveolens in all four populations is characterized by two blade forms: obovate and elliptic (See Table 2). As in other Populus species investigated, several forms can be observed at the endogenous level (within the individual), but one - obovate, with the maximum width above the middle of its length (57-70\%) prevails. On shortened shoots in the middle part of the crown, all leaves of one tree always have only one shape of the apex and base of the leaf blade. In all studied populations of P. suaveolens, individuals with a shortly pointed (sharply pointed) apex dominated, but in 4-6 trees in the plantation the leaves had a gradually pointed shape. Only in Baimka population, plants with a wedge-shaped base of the leaf blade prevailed, in the rest these were roundly wedge-shaped ones (See Table 2). As noted above, one of the morphological traits of leaves characteristic of P. suaveolens is a differently expressed cordate base of the blade and the presence of a small notch. The notch at the base of leaves of shortened shoots is a quite frequent trait, especially in leaves with a rounded wedge-shaped base; it often overlaps with rounded lobes. In our opinion, it is caused by the character of petiole-to-leafplate transition. The fact is that the petiole of P. suaveolens is located in different planes with the blade and enters it at an angle from below, at some distance from the base edge (See Fig. 2). The groove, expressed on the upper side of the petiole, continues to be seen at some distance on the main vein, gradually tapering conically. Here, the first lateral veins branch off at the place where the groove enters. The levels of variability of the considered morphological traits in the populations studied differ in the development of basal glands (See Tables 3 and 4). At the endogenous level, this trait varies greatly from complete absence to 1-4 glands at the base of the blade. However, only in populations ``Bilibino{''} and ``Baimka{''}, 3 individuals (10\%) with leaves without glands were noted, and on the contrary, in ``Peschanka{''} leaves with developed glands prevailed on all plants (See Table 2). In the first two plantations, the greatest number of trees with developed glands on less than 50\% of leaves was noted. Leaf blades with two glands (32.2\% to 67.7\% in the population) and one (8.8\% to 17.3\%) were typical (See Fig. 3). The proportion of leaves without them in the populations ranged from 18.6\% to 52.2\%. Leaves with three and four glands were noted singularly in all populations except ``Bilibino{''}. Consequently, the sign of the presence of basal glands varies both at the endogenous and individual levels. In our opinion, its occurrence in the populations of North-East Russia is caused by ancient introgressive hybridization (possibly repeated) of this taxon with P. balsamifera in the Pliocene-Pleistocene on the territory of Beringia. Obtained as a result of introgression by the fragrant poplar, this trait gradually spread as a result of intraspecific interbreeding from the east deep into the continent. Consequently, the presence of basal glands as a trait in modem populations of P. suaveolens of North-East Russia can be considered as evidence of the existence of Eurasian-American syngameon at certain stages of evolution of the genus. Weak differentiation of the studied populations, despite their considerable remoteness, indicates that modem poplars in the territory of North-East Russia are the result of postglacial recolonization.",Populus suaveolens; variability; morphological traits; population; basal glands; introgressive hybridization,2021,NA,55,10.17223/19988591/55/2,1998-8591,12,83,1223,7729,6,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,"Soil formation in technogenic landscapes: trends, results, and representation in the current classifications (Review)","For hundreds of years, humans have been a soil formation factor. With the recent industrial development of vast territories, the formation of soils in technogenic and post-anthropogenic conditions requires more attention. This study reviews the literature on the soils of human-transformed or human-made landscapes (technogenic landscapes), in which soil formation starts on a new technogenic substrate. Such soils may occur in different bioclimatic conditions. We focused on processes that govern soil morphology and the subsequent transformation of these soils. Often, the soils of technogenic landscapes are characterized by high bulk density values and by the presence of dense contact. Their properties are affected mainly by organic matter accumulation (humus, litter; and peat). The paper also covers approaches to the reclamation of technogenic landscapes, the main stages, and partly the reclamation options. It is noted that the efficiency of reclamation activities depends on the available resources and timely decision-making. We assessed the efficiency of soil reclamation methods and suggested technogenic landscape survey techniques. The major approaches to soil classification in technogenic landscapes in national and international soil classification systems are briefly discussed, and an approximate correlation of soil names used in different systems is suggested. All considered classifications provide the opportunity to assess the soil properties and specifics of soil formation in technogenic landscapes.

VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Spatial distribution of macrozoobenthos communities in a plain river of a semi-desert zone,"Current climate changes require special attention to the implementation of environmental activities in arid regions. The study of the biotic component of water bodies of such ecosystems and the patterns of their spatial distribution is an important area of scientific research. The river network of the semi-desert zone of the Russian Plain is one of the least studied lotic systems in the Lower Volga basin. In this river network, the plain Yeruslan River is of the greatest importance because it largely determines the environmental characteristics of this arid territory. Therefore, it is important to study the structural indicators and spatial dynamics of macrozoobenthos communities in the Yeruslan River. The aim of the work was to study species composition, the structural and quantitative indicators of macrozoobenthos from the source to the mouth of the Yeruslan River and to determine the conceptual belonging of the bottom communities of the plain river of the semidesert zone to a certain type of distribution. The Yeruslan River (51 degrees 18'3 `' N, 47 degrees 46'19 `' E) flows through the semi-desert zone of the Russian Plain (Volgograd region, Russia) and it is a tributary of Volgograd reservoir. The length of the Yeruslan River is 282 km, with a catchment area of 55700 km(2). We collected samples of macrozoobenthos at 9 stations of the Yeruslan River (See Fig. 1) in June 2015 and July 2016. In the ripal zone, the integrated samples for quantitative macrozoobenthos analysis were taken using an Ekman-type grab sampler (surface area 25 cm(2)) in replicates (8X) and a handle blade trawl (0.2 M x 0.5 M). In the medial zone, samples were taken by an Ekman-type grab sampler (surface area 250 cm(2)) in replicates (2X). Samples were washed in the field using a mesh screen with 300-310-mu m mesh size and preserved in 4\% formaldehyde. At each station of the Yeruslan River, we used field analytical instruments for measuring pH and oxygen content. Water samples were taken for hydrochemical analysis at different sections of the river (See Table 1). We used the model of isolation by distance (Malecot, 1948), Monmonier's maximum difference algorithm (Manni et al., 2004) and the Dickey-Fuller test (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) to perform statistical analysis of changes in the species structure of macrozoobenthos. The Yeruslan River flows within the geochemical province of continental salinity, which is characterized by an evaporative type of natural water regime, leading to progressive accumulation of salts. In this research, we found out that water was brackish at several stations of the river (1250-1420 mgl(-1)) due to water drainage of saline soils. We revealed that the Yeruslan River is polluted with nitrite nitrogen (at station 1) and phosphorus compounds (at stations 4 and 8) but concentrations of ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, cadmium, copper, zinc and lead did not exceed the MPC. Comparative analysis has shown that from the source to the mouth of the river there are no significant changes in the speed of water velocity flow, and the physical and chemical conditions are specific for each station. In the river, we collected 132 species: 47 - Diptera, 20 - Oligochaeta, 11 - Mollusca, 11 - Grustacea, 11 - Coleoptera, 7 - Trichoptera, 7 - Heteroptera, 6 - Hirudinea, 4 - Odonata, 4 - Ephemeroptera, 1 - Lepidoptera, Hydracarina, Polychaeta and Megaloptera. The macrozoobenthos of the river is represented by limnophilic species in the upper, middle and lower reaches. This is due to the small slope of the Yeruslan River and the presence of permanent and temporary dams. In the mouth reaches, the macrozoobenthos communities included species of the Ponto-Caspian and Ponto-Azov zoogeographic complexes. At all stations of the river, Oligochaeta and Chironomidae were of high density. Also, in the river mouth, Mollusca were of high density (See Fig. 2). Statistical analysis of sequences of hydrobiological characteristics along the longitudinal gradient of the Yeruslan River using the Dickey-Fuller test showed that the presence of a stationary distribution trend with random ``wandering{''} is typical of the series of total density and biomass of macrozoobenthos, the number of worms of the family Tubificidae, larvae of chironomids of the subfamily Tanytarsini and mayflies of the family Baetidae. For the other series of observations, the presence of a nonlinear trend is noted (See Table 3 and Fig. 3). The selection of a sequence of borders (barrier) between river communities within the ecosystem by Montmonier's method using a matrix of species distances by the Bray-Curtis method made it possible to identify the source (station 1) with a high level of nitritic nitrogen in the water as one of the specific areas. The second most important border separates station 3 with a low content of dissolved oxygen, and the third one allocates the mouth reaches (station 9) as an independent area, where there is a cohabitation of river and reservoir species (See Fig. 4). Based on the analysis of fauna and using statistical methods, we found out that macrozoobenthos communities do not change from the source to the mouth of the river in accordance with the ``the river continuum concept{''}. The habitat of taxa depends on local abiotic and biotic factors at each river station, therefore, we can assume that the distribution of macrozoobenthos communities, generally, corresponds to ``the patch dynamics concept{''}. At the same time, stations 1, 3 and 9 form fairly isolated hydrogeomorphological areas, which is postulated by the concept of ``the functional process zones{''}. It seems that the spatial distribution of macrozoobenthos communities in the Yeruslan River can be explained by a complex combination of two concepts: ``the patch dynamics concept{''} and ``the functional process zones{'' This type of distribution seems to be typical of plain rivers with very low water velocity and the presence of dams.

VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,Spruce forests of the Koptu River valley (the Republic of Tuva) as a relict of Late Pleistocene vegetation,"Spruce forests of the Tuva Republic are not sufficiently described in literature. Spruce forests occupy small areas, but they are characterized by high species diversity. Enclaves of forest communities outside the forest belt are particularly interesting. The actual problem concerns species composition which forms plant communities existing under environmental and climate conditions that are not favorable for it. The aim of the research is to describe the communities of the valley dark coniferous forests in the model river valley in Central Tuva, to assess their diversity, to analyze species composition and to identify the main factors determining it. In the course of the fieldwork in 2020, we examined coniferous forests along the Koptu river, on the southern slope of the Academic Obruchev range (See Figures). In this part of the range, the foothills are occupied by steppe vegetation; forest-steppe landscapes prevail at altitudes of 800-1000 m; above there is the taiga belt, the upper border of the forest is about 1900 m above sea level. Two key areas were investigated; one of them is located in the middle course of the river within the taiga belt (51.90-51.92 degrees N; 95.45-95.48 degrees E, 1400-1500 m above sea level), the other is in the lower course of the river in the forest-steppe belt (51.55-51.70 degrees N; 95.34-95.45 degrees E, 700-900 m above sea level). In total, 11 releves were made on plots of 20 x20 m by the standard method. We established that the forests are rich in species: 98 taxa were registered (See Table). It could be expected that coniferous forests in the river valley within the forest-steppe belt are a continuation of the above located communities, a continuation of communities from the taiga belt. However, our materials have demonstrated that it is not so. We revealed that, despite the physiognomic similarity, the dark coniferous communities growing in the river valley in its lower course differ significantly from those growing within the taiga belt (See Table). Larix sibirica is abundant everywhere; but in the taiga belt Pinus sibirica dominates in the valley communities, and Picea obovata prevailes in the river valley in the forest-steppe belt. Apart from it, the communities of these two key sites differ significantly in their species composition. Analysis of the ecology of differentiating species shows that the difference is due to a complex of factors. Four groups of species can be distinguished in the investigated forests: I. Taiga species which are only encountered in forests of the upper part and are absent below (Aegopodium alpestre, Carex iljinii, Cerastium paucillorum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, V. uliginosum). II. Meadow species, symmetrically, only occur in the forests of the lower part and are absent in the taiga belt (Galium boreale, Lathyrus pratensis, Rubus saxatilis and Vicia cracca, Achillea asiatica, Adonis sibirica, Artemisia laciniata, Iris ruthenica). The two groups mentioned above reflect the difference in altitude as well as the influence of the zonal environment. III. A series of species in the downstream valley forests reflect a waterlogging process, which takes place there due to the altitudinal gradient declining and surface flattening (Angelica tenuifolia, Caltha palustris, Carex cespitosa, C. dioica, Equisetum scirpoides, Delphinium crassifolium, Galium uliginosum, Lathyrus palustris, Parnassia palustris, Ribes procumbens; among mosses - Calliergonella cuspidata, Helodium blandowii, Timmia megapolitana, Tomentypnum nitens). IV. A number of species with mainly taiga or Arctic-Alpine distribution were recorded only in larch-spruce forests in the river valley in the forest-steppe belt and they are absent in the forests of the upper key area (Carex alba, Bistorta vivipara, Carex sedakowii, Orthilia obtusata, Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum, Saussurea alpina, Schizachne callosa). For these species, it is impossible to explain their presence in the forest-steppe belt by modem ecological conditions. Their presence in the valley spruce forests has historical reasons and could be caused by the conditions of the Late Pleistocene cooling. So, we can draw a conclusion that the massif of valley spruce forests in the lower part of the Koptu river is a relict community formed in the Late Pleistocene periglacial environment on permafrost soils. In present conditions, it is in unstable equilibrium. The massif is the habitat of a number of rare species. In particular, the Orchidaceae taxa were found here, four of which are included in the Red Book of the Republic of Tuva (Cypripedium calceolus, Dactylorhiza sibirica, Epipogium aphyllum, Neottianthe cucullata). The valley forest of the lower part of the Koptu river can be nominated as a high conservation value forest and recommended to be included in the list of the Important Plant Areas of the Altai-Sayan region. The massif is under the strong anthropogenic pressure; in order to avoid extinction, it needs to be protected.",coenoflora; biodiversity; Important Plant Areas; rare species; extrazonal vegetation,2021,NA,54,10.17223/19988591/54/3,1998-8591,18,106,770,4999,5,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA,The EEG alpha rhythm frequency dynamics during the auditory perception of actions and its relation to intelligence level in children aged 7-10 years,"A number of studies have shown the possibility of taking the EEG individual alpha peak frequency (IAPF) as an informative neurophysiological indicator of the overall cognitive efficiency of the human brain. The main goal of the present work was to study the IAPF reactivity in primary school age children in the process of auditory perception of sounds accompanying familiar instrumental movements, and to measure its hypothesized correlation to the verbal and non-verbal intelligence development. The effects of gender and age of children on these interrelations have also been estimated. We analyzed the data pertaining to the sample of primary school children aged 7-10 years (62 subjects). To assess possible age-related effects, the sample of children was additionally divided into two groups aged 7-8 years (24 boys and10 girls) and 9-10 years (14 boys and 14 girls). During the experiment, the subject and the experimenter sat at the adjacent places, with a monitor and a computer mouse (CM) placed on the table in front of each of them. A video showing the CM section of the experimenter's table was displayed on the monitor screen in front of the subject. Experimental tasks comprised a series of stages (30 s each) including the conditions of a passive visual fixation on the video image of a motionless CM, execution of self-paced circular right-hand movements with CM, observation of similar movements produced by the experimenter, real-time imitation of the experimenter's movements, wakeful rest with eyes closed, and auditory perception of familiar sounds accompanying the CM movements produced by the experimenter (subject's eyes still closed). In the context of the present study, we analyzed the EEG dynamics in subjects during the two final stages with eyes closed: wakeful rest (WR) and auditory perception (AP) of familiar CM movements produced by the experimenter. The area of interest in the present study was the electrical activity of the laterally located parietal (P3, P4) and occipital (O1, O2) EEG electrodes. JAPF values were calculated for each of them within 7-13 Hz frequency range and averaged for the sum of them for the two corresponding experimental stages. The reactivity of the alpha rhythm frequency was calculated for each subject separately as the difference between the values of the dominant alpha rhythm frequency in two situations: the auditory perception of instrumental movements and the wakeful rest. Positive values of the frequency reactivity indicated its increase under condition of auditory perception of movements, and negative values - its decrease. The intelligence development levels of the participants were assessed with the help of the Wechsler test for children (WISC). In the context of the present study, the verbal and non-verbal intelligence scores were analyzed separately. We can conclude that in the primary school age children, the individual frequency of the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm in boys does not differ significantly between the groups aged 7-8 and 9-10 years. In girls, in the older group this indicator has a significantly higher value (See Table 1). For children aged 7-10 years, a significant positive correlation was identified between JAPF and non-verbal intelligence score. No connection with verbal intelligence has been found (See Fig. 1). The condition of auditory perception of sounds accompanying familiar instrumental actions evokes the decrease in the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm frequency in the majority of primary school age children, which is most characteristic for the groups of girls aged 9-10 years (See Table 2). A relatively small percentage of children (similar to 18\%) who demonstrated an increase in the frequency of the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm under condition of auditory perception of familiar instrumental actions, are characterized by lower scores of nonverbal intelligence, relative to their peers (See Fig. 2). Thus, nonverbal intelligence development can be related to the individual developmental characteristics of neural network oscillators, which can be reflected in children as multidirectional reactions in alpha rhythm frequency.",individual alpha peak frequency; auditory perception of instrumental actions; verbal intelligence; nonverbal intelligence; children,2021,NA,56,10.17223/19988591/56/5,1998-8591,23,148,635,4163,5,10,500,7,Yes,525,475,yes,no,yes
VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT,A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF EVAPOTRANSPIRATION IN THE TRADITIONAL OASIS IN THE SOUTH OF TUNISIA,"Estimating the evapotranspiration is important for many sides. The first is to determine the amount of water really needed by vegetable canopies. The second is to analyse the role of plants in buffering the effects of climatic change. In this work we have tried to evalu-ate the amount of evapotranspiration inside and above the traditional oasis of Tozeur by moni-toring profiles of global radiation, net radiation, sap flow, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, air temperature and air humidity. We have used fixed captors installed at different heights inside the oasis and mobile captors carried by a meteorological balloon. Results show that evapotranspira-tion deduced from the total global radiation intercepted inside the oasis is equivalent to 4,4 mm/ day. That estimated from global radiation received above the oasis is equivalent to 6,81 mm/day. When using the total net radiation intercepted by all the oasis (respectively the net radiation received above the oasis), the evapotranspiration is equivalent to 3,24 mm/day (respectively about 4 mm/day). The evapotranspiration estimated from daily sap flow transpired is about 3,3 mm/day. We have noticed also, that inside the oasis air temperature follows a decreasing func-tion with the altitude in the early morning and later in the afternoon. It follows an increasing function between 9 and 15 hours. Above the oasis, air temperature, relative humidity and air pressure, follow globally decreasing functions with altitudes. However, considerable levels of fluctuation were recorded for all the parameters throughout the first altitudes above the oasis.",ATMOSPHERE; LATENT HEAT FLUX; SENSIBLE HEAT FLUX; NET SOLAR RADIATION; GLOBAL SOLAR RADIATION; SAP FLOW; CLIMATIC PARAMETER; FARMING STOREY,2021,71,1,NA,0240-8759,14,94,245,1617,8,NA,200,8,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT,ADAPTATION OF GRASSLAND SPRINGTAILS (COLLEMBOLA) TO DRY AND HOT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS,"Some springtails (Collembola) are known to be tolerant to drought.

The purpose of the present study was to assess the desiccation and the heat tolerance of an epedaphic springtail community of a grassland habitat (lawn). Survival at high temperatures with regard to these parameters has also been investigated. Out of the seven collected species (Ceratophysella cavicola, Entomobrya multifasciata, Lepidocyrtus cyaneus, Sminthurinus aureus, Sminthurinus elegans, Sminthurus viridis, and Sphaeridia pumilis) diapause was observed in S. elegans (up to 60 days), S. viridis (90 days), S. pumilis and C. cavicola (246 days).

During spring, summer and autumn 2018, macro-benthos and water samples were collected and treated out at 16 stations located in the main confluence area along the Kebir-Rhumel wadi. One of the main objectives of the present work was to investigate diversity and distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates species according to environmental characteristics in this catchment area. The pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrite and phosphate were significantly different (P value < 0.05) between the sampling sites. The conductivity and nutrient concentrations were higher in the upstream part of the Kebir-Rhumel catchment, while dissolved oxygen decreased, indicating that Rhumel wadi is more polluted. A total of 16,069 individuals and 129 taxa, belonging to 77 families in 15 orders, were identified. Mean values of taxon richness, Shannon-Wiener (1949), Pielou's (1966) evenness, Margalef (1958) and Simpson (1949) indices indicate that Kebir wadi and their tributaries supported a more macro-benthos diversity than Rhumel wadi. The species composition and the EPT index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) showed the occurrence of pollution-sensitive macro-benthos groups in Kebir wadi, while the Rhumel wadi was mainly characterized by pollution-tolerant taxa, indicating anthropogenic disturbance and habitat degradation, which is evident by the diagnosis of the physicochemical water quality at Kebir-Rhumel wadi. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that altitude, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and nitrate were found to be the primary factors affecting the communities structure of benthic macroinvertebrates in the study area.",KEBIR-RHUMEL WADI; BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES; BIODIVERSITY\&nbsp; PHYSICOCHEMICAL; POLLUO-RESISTANT,2021,71,1,NA,0240-8759,13,106,243,1784,5,NA,200,8,No,225,175,yes,no,yes

From the three distinct sexually mature male morphs of P. sculpta, only the larger (alpha) was found, confirming the absence of the two smaller male morphs (beta and gamma) in an introduced population. Females reached size at first sexual maturity from 4 mm in length, the fecundity ranged from 5 to 14 eggs.

In vitro study, the synthetization of silver nanoparticles by Men-tha spicata leaf extract was subjected to physical characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which confirmed that the particle diameters of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) ranged from 57 to 97 nanometers. The antifungal activity of synthesized AgNPs with poisoned food technique was used against a pathogenic fungus with different concentrations (50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/l); furthermore, different concentrations of the fungicide Vitavax (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 g/l) and two biological control agents (Trichoderma harzianum, Bacillus subtilis) were also applied to investigate their antifungal activity against the fungus. The pots experiment was applied under greenhouse conditions during the 2020 season by soaking tomato seedlings in different treatments. The results indicated that the AgNPs treatment yielded the least disease severity among various treatments. All treatments were found effective at different rates, in particular, AgNPs to promote the vegetative growth parameters of tomato plants and controlling the root rot disease caused by pathogenic fungus. Treated plants with AgNPs record-ed a low concentration of proline and the highest values of chlorophyll pigments.

VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT,CAN ABANDONED SALINAS BE MANAGED AS COASTAL LAGOONS?,"Twenty-two of the Mediterranean coastal Salinas in S. France have been abandoned for salt extraction since 1950 and most are now available for nature conservation purposes. Their management is a challenge as the abandoned Salinas are human-modified systems, compartmentalized in salt ponds, with other important modifications in the landscape. These landscape modifications were studied in more detail in two examples by studying historic maps. Thus, for the Salin de Peyriac (Aude), an original endorheic lake (Etang du Doul) was converted into a pre-concentrating pond and nowadays persists as a hypersaline coastal lagoon. Salin des Pesquiers (Var) was created since 1848 within the Etang du Pesquier coastal lagoon. Therefore, the course of the Roubaud River, the tributary to this lagoon, was deviated to flow directly to the sea. Together with the creation of a circumferential canal this resulted in destruction of the original Roubaud delta and its fringing wetlands with ecotones in their freshwater - salt water transition zones. Both abandoned Salinas can in principle be managed as coastal lagoons, because the sediment surfaces of their ponds are located below mean sea level. Nevertheless, the Ecosystem-based management of these systems has to acknowledge a large degree of artificiality. Complete ecological restoration to historic conditions appears unrealistic and is often not desirable. Hence, abandoned Salinas offer many possibilities for creative and experimental management that should be followed by action monitoring and assessed by scientific studies.Y",ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT; COASTAL LAGOON; SALINA; HALOPHILE; HISTORIC MAPS,2020,70,3-Apr,NA,0240-8759,8,52,233,1579,5,NA,200,8,No,225,175,yes,no,yes

The aim of this research study is to apply this approach to artificial reefs (AR) along the French metropolitan coasts.

VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT,"FAVORING EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE LAGOONS: A NECESSARY SUPPORT FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE AS FISH NURSERY IN THE SALTMARSHES OF HYERES (PROVENCE, FRANCE)","The salt exploitation of the saltmarshes of Hyeres (Salin des Pesquiers and Vieux Salins sites) has led to the isolation of the lagoon from the sea to control evaporation. The question of whether or not the saltmarshes' ecological functioning is impaired with regard to the fish population is one aspect that has been studied at the ecosystem scale. During 2018-2019, 4 samplings with 4 mm-mesh size fyke nets (24 h fishing duration) confirmed that the two saltmarshes still have a relictual nursery role. If juvenile fishes were numerically dominant in the catches, adults were also present. A few euryhaline and permanent small-sized taxa (Atherinidae, Gobiidae, Syngnathidae) contributed to 90 \% of the total abundance in the catches. The amphihaline migrator Anguilla anguilla (mainly adult stages) was the main contributor to the biomass of catches. Juveniles of commercial species such as Dicentrarchus labrax, Sparus aurata, Mugilidae and Soleidae were caught in autumn and spring when going back and forth between the lagoon and the sea. Their tolerance of a wide range of salinity enables them to benefit temporarily from good environmental conditions for their growth. However, considering the low connectivity and the high salinity of most of the ponds, most of those marine fish juveniles are probably trapped inside the lagoon. In both lagoons, the closer the sampling sites were to the open sea, the higher were the species richness and density of the juveniles, suggesting that other parts of the lagoons function as an ecological sink. The diversity of the fish assemblages of the saltmarshes of Hyeres is directly dependent on the effectiveness of the connection with the open sea. Among the different actions emerging from this study, the introduction of a sluice gate between the northern pond (Salin des Pesquiers) and the input channel could significantly enhance exchanges and potentially provide support for fish resources at sea.",SALTMARSHES; LAGOONS; EXPERIMENTAL FISHING; NURSERY; FISH JUVENILES,2020,70,3-Apr,NA,0240-8759,28,178,308,1954,5,NA,200,8,No,225,175,yes,no,yes
WETLANDS,Impacts of Nitrogen and Sediment on Restored Wetland Plant Assemblages from an Agricultural Landscape,"The ability to predict the impact of abiotic stressors on plant assemblage characteristics during habitat restoration is critical in the success of targeted restoration efforts. In an effort to determine wetland plant responses to common agricultural stressors, we seeded 75 mesocosms with soil collected from three restored wetlands in the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley. These mesocosms were subjected to four different combinations of nitrogen and sediment addition and monitored for two growing seasons. Resulting assemblages showed strong effects from site of origin with weaker effects of imposed treatments on assemblage composition. In contrast to species composition, summary metrics of assemblage quality (e.g., richness and diversity) were negatively affected by increased nitrogen and sediment levels, vs. controls. Over time, assemblage phylogenetic relatedness became more clustered, indicating the importance of abiotic filtering on wetland plant assemblages in agricultural landscapes. Our results indicate that agriculturally derived stressors can exert a filtering effect on plant assemblages, impact their perceived quality, and lessen the importance of soil site of origin in restored wetlands in agricultural landscapes.",Restored wetlands; Plant assemblages; Assemblage development; Nutrient and sediment loading; Plant phylogenetic assembly,2022,42,7,10.1007/s13157-022-01619-6,0277-5212,14,101,171,1244,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

In this study, the spatial distribution and diversity of crabs within two different habitats were studied through four seasons in 2018. A total of 11 species were identified, of which nine species were found in un-vegetated (mudflats) and eleven species in vegetated (mangrove) habitats. Opusia indica, Manningis arabicum, and Nasima dotilliformis were the dominant species in un-vegetated habitats, while O. indica, M. arabicum, and Parasesarma persicum were dominant in vegetated habitats. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations (nMDS) and a three-way factor PERMANOVA indicated that the crab species assemblage differed significantly between the two habitats, but not among seasons. The vegetated habitats showed higher species richness and Shannon-Weiner diversity index than un-vegetated habitats. However, the species evenness index showed no difference between the habitats. The result of redundancy analysis (RDA), indicated that the sediment grain size and organic matter (OM) content were responsible for the distribution of brachyuran crabs between these two habitats.

Here, we examined current and future habitat suitability under climate change scenarios that could help to manage Barringtonia acutangula, a rheophytic tree of socio-ecological importance. We model the habitat suitability class of B. acutangula under current and future climate (2050) scenarios based on 89 (57 from India and 32 from Bangladesh) locations and bio-climatic and elevation variables using species distribution modelling (SDM) by MaxEnt. Out of the total area, i.e., 2,450,577 km(2), of the Indo-Bangladesh landscape, 199,063 km(2) (8.12\%) is highly suitable for the distribution of B. acutangula, but it is predicted to decrease by 50.57\% (100,669 km(2)) by 2050 under the future climate change scenario. Country-wise habitat analysis revealed that out of the total area (139,799 km(2)) in Bangladesh, 95,541 km(2) (68.34\%) is highly suitable area for B. acutangula, but this is projected to decline under the climate change scenario by 34,801 km(2) (36.43\%) by 2050. While in India, the highly suitable area of B. acutangula is 103,522 km(2) (4.48\%) and is predicted to further decrease by 65,868 km(2) (63.63\%) by 2050. Our study highlights that precipitation seasonality, precipitation in the coldest quarter and precipitation in the driest period are the strongest predictors of the distribution of B. acutangula in the Indo-Bangladesh landscape. In the climate change scenario, changes in the precipitation pattern, in particular, can put B. acutangula under stress and lead to a high risk of population shrinkage in the Indo-Bangladesh landscape. Therefore, urgent attention is needed for conservation of B. acutangula, as it is sensitive and vulnerable to changing global climatic patterns.",Barringtonia acutangula; Indo-Bangladesh Landscape; Climate change; Distribution; MaxEnt; Modelling,2022,42,7,10.1007/s13157-022-01621-y,0277-5212,17,123,304,2042,6,NA,250,6,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
WETLANDS,Predictors of Calcareous Fen Floristic Quality in a Rapidly Urbanizing County,"The impacts of urbanization on groundwater-dependent wetlands have been little studied. Here I determine whether variables associated with urbanization predict calcareous fen floristic quality in rapidly urbanizing Dane Co., WI, as well as likely degradation mechanisms. I measured: (1) floristic quality measures; (2) indicators of non-native propagule pressure (3) indicators of human influences on subsurface hydrology (4) patch characteristics; (5) presence of land-use legacies, and; (6) distance from urban structures for county fens. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) showed that high floristic quality was positively associated with distance from roads and negatively associated with high-capacity-well (HCW) influence, land-use legacies, and population density. Non-native richness and cover were positively associated with HCW influence and population density, and negatively associated with distance from roads. Distance from urban structures other than roads did not factor into any model. These results indicate that urbanization impacts fen floristic quality through increasing groundwater extraction and non-native propagule pressure through processes that are not linked to developed areas, per se. In contrast, degraded fens in rural areas were impacted by legacies of past agricultural activities.",Urbanization; Fens; Groundwater; Land-use legacies; Floristic quality,2022,42,8,10.1007/s13157-022-01595-x,0277-5212,11,77,178,1321,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
WETLANDS,Effects of Landscape Heterogeneity at Multiple Spatial Scales on Paddy field-breeding Frogs in a Large Alluvial Plain in Japan,"Enhancing the environmental heterogeneity of habitats is essential to decelerate the degradation of biodiversity in rice paddy ecosystems caused by the recent rapid changes in agricultural landscapes. However, paddy field environments hierarchically belong to agricultural landscapes and river basins. Therefore, the spatial scale of environmental heterogeneity affecting the distribution patterns and abundance of the organisms inhabiting paddy fields, such as frog species, varies. Thus, in the Kanto Plain, the largest alluvial plain in Japan, we conducted an extensive frog survey to ascertain multiple spatial scale heterogeneities of frog abundance in relation to topography, climate, land use pattern, and features of paddy fields. Across 200 field sites, five frog species were detected during calling surveys. The statistical, niche and abundance models revealed differences in distribution patterns, spatial heterogeneity of abundance, and environmental preference of these frogs at the spatial levels of river basins, landscapes, and paddy fields. While the distribution pattern and abundance of Zhangixalus schlegelii were affected by the percentage of forest area, those of Pelophylax porosus porosus were sensitive to features relating to water availability of the paddy fields. Despite the small diversity of species detected, the presence of two species with unique habitat preferences revealed significant benefits of habitat heterogeneity in the agricultural landscape, allowing us to suggest management strategies for improving frog diversity in agricultural landscapes dominated by paddy fields.",Abundance model; Anuran call surveys; Species distribution model; MaxEnt; Rice paddy ecosystems,2022,42,8,10.1007/s13157-022-01607-w,0277-5212,19,126,223,1615,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

In light of its wide range of social and economic benefits and many effects on human well-being, the present study attempts to determine local stakeholders' dependency, resource use, knowledge, and perception of wetland conservation. We conducted 120 household surveys in villages adjacent to Ansupa Lake. We used a questionnaire with both open-ended and closed-ended questions to obtain information on the socioeconomic profile of the villagers, their dependencies, and their perceptions of lake conservation. We used a Likert scale to measure respondents' perceptions and ordinal regression to analyse the datasets. The survey found that people living on the lake's fringes depend directly or indirectly on it, regardless of their economic status. Nearly 40\% of the respondents relied entirely on the lake for their livelihood. Irrigation, pisciculture, non-timber forest products, and fodder are economic benefits derived from the lake. In this context, the findings of the study highlight a substantial link between dependency, benefits, and education, influencing residents' perceptions of the lake. Further, our study could be helpful to society in terms of Ansupa lake conservation and management planning, as well as the government in involving locals in lake conservation initiatives and decision-making processes.",Ansupa; Wetland; Conservation; Livelihood-dependency; Natural-resources,2022,42,8,10.1007/s13157-022-01620-z,0277-5212,19,129,211,1460,5,NA,250,6,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

The polychaete assemblages and the environmental parameters in the estuarine area of Sungai Terengganu were examined based on nine stations along a salinity gradient from oligohaline to polyhaline. Samples were collected using a Smith McIntyre grab and yielded 1886 individuals, from 43 species grouped into 24 families. The fauna was mainly dominated by Composetia sp. (39.48\%) and Cossura sp.

WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,"Migration patterns and habitat use by molt migrant temperate-breeding Canada geese in James Bay, Canada","Numbers of temperate-breeding Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Canada geese have greatly increased since the 1980s. Consequently, numbers of yearlings, sub-adults and failed breeders undertaking pre-molt migration to northern latitudes has also increased, potentially providing additional hunting opportunities for Cree hunters living near James Bay, Canada. We described movement patterns and habitat use of molt migrant Canada geese Brenta canadensis maxima along the east coast of James Bay based on nine geese fitted with GSM-GPS devices during 11 northward and eight southward migrations between 2015 and 2019. Geese staged for 2.8 +/- 0.6 days (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at 3.2 +/- 0.6 staging sites (mostly tidal flats and salt marshes) from the first week of June in spring and 3.8 +/- 1.8 days at 2.0 +/- 0.5 staging sites (mostly inland freshwater wetlands, peatlands and tidal flats) from the first week of September when returning south. Shallow and deep water habitats were used as resting sites during both migrations. In spring, molt migrants were mostly harvested in June well after the migration of sub-arctic breeding geese whereas in autumn, both subspecies were harvested in September. Molt migrant temperate-breeding geese can increase harvest opportunities and represent supplementary wildlife food for Cree communities.

WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,"Seasonal home range and habitat selection patterns of sika deer Cervus nippon in southern Hokkaido, Japan","In 1980 and 1981, eight and nine individual sika deer Cervus nippon were reintroduced in southern Hokkaido, Japan, respectively, to address population declines in this species during 1900s. As recent population growth has led to human-wildlife conflicts, this study investigated the responses of sika deer to resource availability and geomorphic factors during the summer and winter seasons in southern Hokkaido. Global positioning system-collared data collected from 2016 to 2018 were used to assess the home range patterns and habitat selection of 14 female sika deer located in Mount Esan and Shiriuchi. The core home range size was defined using a 50\% kernel density estimation that indicated a larger home range in winter than summer for all deer. Habitat selection was assessed using generalized linear mixed models. The results showed variation in habitat selection between resident deer of Mount Esan and Shiriuchi, as well as migratory deer in Shiriuchi during summer. Resident deer in Mount Esan and Shriuchi preferred areas closer to crops during summer. Interaction effects revealed that migratory deer utilized natural grassland close to forest edge habitat in Shiriuchi. By contrast, resident deer in Shiriuchi selected forest edge habitat and natural grasslands close to crops. In winter, low elevation was the most important habitat factor for all deer across the study area. Thus, sika deer habitat selection depends on resource availability in summer and topographic factors in the winter.",GPS-collar; habitat selection; home range; sika deer; summer; winter,2023,2023,1,10.1002/wlb3.01060,0909-6396,16,105,230,1508,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,Abundance and distribution of ruffed grouse Bonasa umbellus at the southern periphery of the range,"Peripheral populations of ruffed grouse Bonasa umbellus at the trailing edge of their range are likely to be at risk of population declines and potential extirpation from continued climate and habitat change. Accurate estimates of abundance and distribution are needed for peripheral populations to inform management decisions. We show that ruffed grouse density at the southern periphery of their range is much lower than in areas farther north. We surveyed the abundance of drumming male grouse across northern Georgia during the springs of 2020-2021 by performing roadside point counts at 634 survey points. We used hierarchical distance sampling models to predict grouse abundance across north Georgia and model spatial variation in density. We estimated population size to be 2671 ruffed grouse in Georgia (95\% confidence interval 678-11 084). Mean grouse density was 0.003 drumming males/ha (SD = 0.006), with the highest density centered in the high-elevation mountains. Uncertainty around abundance estimates was high, in part due to low precision when estimating availability. Low detectability and precision are likely to be common issues when surveying low-abundance populations, as often occurs at range peripheries. We suggest that abundance estimation could be improved by integrating alternate methods, such as automated recording units, into existing monitoring protocols.",hierarchical distance sampling; population abundance; range periphery; ruffed grouse,2022,2022,5,10.1002/wlb3.01017,0909-6396,15,98,203,1389,4,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

Previous research has examined habitat characteristics at varying spatial scales, but none have used occupancy modeling to examine trends over time. Therefore, we used presence/absence data from live trapping to assess environmental variables likely to influence Allegheny woodrat occupancy and detection patterns at a regional scale across western Virginia, USA, from 2009 to 2011. We observed a shift in occupancy and detection rates across years with a peak in 2009, a decline in 2010 and apparent recovery in 2011. We found significant isolation by distance effect influencing woodrat occupancy across the region, with occupancy linked to sites in closer proximity to other occupied locations. Occupancy increased in oak and hickory forests, suggesting woodrat occurrence increases in forest types with a higher abundance of hard and soft mast-producing species. We found variable effects of elevation over time, with higher occupancy at higher elevations in 2009 but at lower elevations in 2010, which may be explained by variation in winter severity and mast abundance across years. Allegheny woodrat management should include activities to promote and retain mast-producing species at higher elevations to offset potential subpopulation contractions during harsh winters.",elevation; isolation by distance; metapopulation; Neotoma magister; oak-hickory forests; occupancy,2022,2022,3,10.1002/wlb3.01023,0909-6396,8,66,209,1429,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,Analysis of mammal mesopredator scat samples indicates significant predation on the endangered Hungarian meadow viper (Vipera ursinii rakosiensis),"Animal populations are regulated by multiple factors, e.g. resource availability, diseases and predators. However, these factors can be significantly influenced by anthropogenic effects (e.g. biological invasions, mesopredator release) and either subserve populations or push them towards local extinction. The Hungarian meadow viper Vipera ursinii rakosiensis is an endangered reptile, with only a few surviving populations following recent alterations and fragmentation of their habitats. In Hungary, all documented populations are located within nature conservation areas. Significant practical conservation efforts have been made, including habitat reconstruction and development, as well as ex situ breeding and reintroductions. Nevertheless, the estimated overall population size of Hungarian meadow viper remains very low, and the impact of conservation interventions is practically immeasurable according to low densities. It is hypothesized that predation is the main factor interfering with conservation efforts of the vipers. Here, we analysed the diet of two mammalian predators (European badger and red fox) in a Hungarian meadow viper habitat. We found a high prevalence of viper remains in the processed faecal samples, indicating that a high number of individuals vipers are subject to predation even within a short period of time. We conclude that effective predator control might be necessary to increase the impact of standard conservation measures (e.g. habitat development, ex situ breeding and reintroduction) that target the restoration of Hungarian meadow viper populations.",conservation; predation pressure; predator control; reptiles; snakes; wildlife management,2022,2022,4,10.1002/wlb3.01033,0909-6396,18,146,222,1598,6,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

To examine the potential use of drone (unmanned aerial vehicle; UAV) observation using thermal infrared images for sex ratio monitoring of deer, we conducted UAV surveys at night in a sparse forest located on the distribution periphery of sika deer Cervus nippon and wild boar Sus scrofa local populations during summer and winter. Of the 163 thermal infrared images of large mammals detected, 132 (81.0\%) and 16 (9.8\%) were identified for deer and wild boar, respectively. In addition, velvet antlers of deer were visually recognized during summer, and 92\% of the detected deer were antlered. This biased sex ratio would be a characteristic in the distribution periphery of local deer populations.

WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,Does prey scarcity increase the risk of wolf attacks on domestic dogs?,"Gray wolf Canis lupus predation on domestic dogs Canis familiaris is a considerable wolf-human conflict issue in several regions of Europe and North America but it has not been well documented in the scientific literature. Livestock depredations by wolves may be related to the abundance of wild prey. Regardless of the presumed motivations of wolves for attacking dogs (likely due to interference competition and predation), the abundance of wild prey populations may also influence the risk of wolf attacks on dogs. We examined whether the annual number of fatal attacks by wolves on dogs was related to the abundance of primary prey, including wild boar Sus scrofa and roe deer Capreolus capreolus in Estonia, as well as the abundance of moose Alces alces in Finland. Statistical models resulted in significant negative relationships, thus providing evidence that the risk of attacks in both house yards (Estonia) and hunting situations (Finland) was highest when the density of wild prey was low.

To investigate the potential ecological relationships among habitat type, food nutrients, parasites and hormones in wild boar Sus scrofa, we collected samples of wild boar feces and available plants in their habitat by line transects during winter. Along transects, we identified the composition of plants foraged by wild boar and measured the content of nutrients in available plants to estimate nutrient intake. We also quantified parasites and hormones in wild boar fecal samples. We compared food nutrients among different forest types and explored possible relationships among estimated nutrient intake, parasites and hormones. We found coniferous forest had positive effects on estimated fat intake and negative effects on estimated protein and fiber intake by wild boar. Furthermore, we revealed that estimated fat intake was negatively correlated with Metastrongylus elongatus parasites and positively correlated with triiodothyronine (T3). In contrast, estimated protein intake was positively correlated with M. elongatus and negatively correlated with T3. Finally, we found negative relationships between T3 concentrations and loads of Ascaris suum parasites and between cortisol (COR) and loads of Trichuris suis parasites.

WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,Efficacy of spotlights and thermal cameras to detect lions Panthera leo and spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta depends on species and management regime,"Accurate abundance estimates can contribute to effective management of large carnivore populations. Lion Panthera leo and spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta populations are frequently estimated at night by eliciting their approach using broadcasted vocalizations. Spotlights are typically used to observe these species on approach but can disturb animals and adversely affect counts. We compared the efficacy of spotlight with red filters and forward looking infrared (FLIR) thermal monocular to enumerate lions and spotted hyenas in Serengeti National Park (SNP; non-hunted area) and Maswa Game Reserve (MGR; hunted area), Tanzania, during 2015-2017. We established 119 call-in sites in SNP and 20 in MGR and conducted repeated call-ins at 1-2 week intervals. During call-ins we conducted systematic paired counts using both devices. We assessed the influence of device order, species, hunting regime and land cover on species counts. We found that FLIR was more efficacious for counting hyenas in MGR and spotlight for counting lions in SNP. We found evidence for temporary artificial light disturbance in MGR, as counts were higher when FLIR was used as the second device. Habitat type within 200 m of call-in sites did not influence device performances. Greater spotlight efficacy in SNP is a likely consequence of lower perceived risk and less anthropogenic disturbance compared to MGR. To improve accuracy of counts and subsequent population estimates for lions and spotted hyenas, we recommend consideration of variation in device efficacy, based on species surveyed and management regime.",animal counts; call-in; forward looking infrared (FLIR); large carnivore; lion Panthera leo; Maswa Game Reserve; population estimation; Serengeti National Park; spotlight; spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta; thermal camera,2022,2022,4,10.1002/wlb3.01030,0909-6396,22,147,238,1591,11,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

We experimentally compared the relative abundance of necrophagous insects between sites of caged roe deer carcasses and evisceration residues of roe deer using pitfall-traps. While evisceration residues were used by necrophagous insects, significantly more individuals were sampled at entire deer carcasses; when corrected for biomass, however, no significant difference in abundance for Coleoptera groups was found. Overall, evisceration residues were used earlier and for a shorter period than entire deer carcasses.

Bird abundance was greater in June-July in passive wetlands and greater in September-October in full drawdowns. During spring migration, duck densities were greater in full and partial drawdowns.

WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,Is time partitioning the currency of coexistence for a grassland canid community?,"Habitat and diet preferences are often considered major aspects of niches differentiation among species; however, partitioning of habitat and resource use temporally is often overlooked in modeling coexistence. The plasticity of temporal activity patterns of individuals may influence the species' response to selective forces and long-term persistence. Temporal avoidance may be a mechanism by which subordinate species can reduce the likelihood of direct competition with dominant sympatric species. Here, we examine temporal activity patterns of three canid species (swift fox Vulpes velox, red fox Vulpes vulpes and coyote Canis latrans) to determine how temporal activity patterns and activity overlap varies among species. We found that all species presented seasonal differences in activity patterns. When activity patterns were compared among species, the estimates of activity overlap in the spring season (i.e. breeding and pup-rearing periods) were higher than the activity patterns in the fall (i.e. juvenile dispersal and pair-formation periods); however, activity pattern overlap among species was significant only during the fall. Overall, these patterns revealed a close temporal overlap between swift fox (subordinate species) and both red fox and coyote (dominant species), which provides insight into conditions under which time partitioning may not be as clear as predicted, and other mechanisms may facilitate species coexistence. Considering swift fox population decline and distribution contraction across the North American grasslands, investigating temporal activity patterns of the canid species may reveal the implications of altering such patterns for individual animals, populations and ecosystems.",activity patterns; camera-traps; canids; Canis latrans; coyotes; intraguild interactions; red fox; swift fox; temporal overlap; Vulpes velox; Vulpes vulpes,2022,2022,6,10.1002/wlb3.01027,0909-6396,12,81,240,1727,11,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes

The combined USA and Canadian population has traditionally been managed as a single population; however black duck demographics may vary by region. To help understand potential regional differences in black ducks, we used satellite telemetry to assess migratory chronology and movements of black ducks wintering near Windsor, Nova Scotia, Canada, near the northern limits of their wintering range where numbers are increasing. Wintering black ducks from Nova Scotia did not leave the Atlantic Flyway and included both longer-distance migrants (similar to 1500 km north) and locally-breeding individuals. None of our tracked ducks travelled south of Nova Scotia during any part of the annual cycle, indicating a population segment that never leaves Canada and is subject solely to Canadian harvest pressures. Band recovery data revealed that a small portion (2.4\%) of black ducks originally banded during winter in Nova Scotia were recovered south along the east coast of the USA, indicating that some of these black ducks are subject to international harvest pressures. Our results show that there are differences in annual black duck movements even within a small part of their range, adding to the growing evidence that black duck populations show fine-scale temporal and spatial structure.

WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,Multi-model application informs prey composition of mountain lions Puma concolor,"Global positioning system (GPS) receivers allow researchers to collect location data that provide information about fine-scale animal movements. For large carnivores, these data are routinely processed to identify clusters of GPS locations which are investigated to validate feeding sites, estimate prey species composition and model the likelihood of predation events based on characteristics of GPS location data within clusters. Although developing predation models entails a high level of field effort, researchers are apprehensive in applying system-specific models to other systems both spatially and temporally. Our objectives were to apply and compare multiple predation models to predict and identify feeding events outside of the geographic areas where models were developed. Using our multi-model approach, we identified feeding sites and estimated kill rates and prey composition of mountain lions Puma concolor in southwest Wyoming, USA from 2017 to 2019. Our approach increased our field efficiency by reducing potential field site investigations by 63\%. We provide results of estimated diet composition in our study area where mountain lion prey included relatively high proportions of pronghorn (12.3\%) and smaller mammals, particularly coyotes (7.6\%).

WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,Occupancy modeling of habitat use by white-tailed deer after more than a decade of exclusion in the boreal forest,"The exclusion of herbivores in forest areas is a strategy used to reduce the impact of selective browsing and increase the regeneration of desired plant species. On Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada), selective browsing by white-tailed deer prevents the regeneration of balsam fir - white birch forests leading to their conversion into white spruce forests. Large deer exclosures were established for ca 10-12 years in clear-cuts with patches of residual forest from 2001 to 2006 to assist in the natural regeneration of fir stands and to provide shelter and food resources for deer. Our objective was to assess how deer use exclosures after the removal of fences according to their spatial configuration and habitat composition. We randomly distributed automatic cameras for periods of 14 days during summer in six exclosures ranging from 3.1 to 11.2 km(2) (n = 25 cameras per exclosure) from which deer were reduced for 10-12 years. We compared candidate occupancy models that included spatial configuration and food resource variables while simultaneously controlling for variables affecting detection probability. We obtained weak evidence that deer habitat use increased by 19\% when forage resources, represented by the cover of Cornus canadensis, increased from 0 to 100\%. None of the other variables (distance between the border of exclosures and cameras and distance between forest patches and cameras) was retained, suggesting that the use of regenerating forests by deer in summer after a period of exclusion is related to forage availability and therefore, any forest management that improves food production during summer should help maintain or increase habitat use by deer.",Anticosti Island; camera traps; Cornus canadensis; exclosure; habitat use; management; occupancy models; white-tailed deer,2022,2022,6,10.1002/wlb3.01049,0909-6396,19,113,259,1688,8,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE BIOLOGY,Recent estimate of Asian elephants in Borneo reveals a smaller population,"Asian elephants occurring in northern Borneo form a geographically isolated and genetically distinct population. Of this, the subpopulation of Central Sabah holds the greatest opportunity for long-term survival, due to a relatively large population size and occurrence over a vast, contiguous and protected habitat. We surveyed this subpopulation in 2015 using advanced methods to obtain a population size estimate. We used the distance-sampling framework and laid out transects following a stratified random design for counting elephant dung piles; measured dung decay following the `retrospective' method; and used Bayesian analysis to estimate dung decay rate and dung pile density. Thus, we estimated a posterior mean dung decay rate of 212 days (95\% BCI: 133-319), an overall elephant density of 0.07 per km(2) (95\% BCI: 0.03-0.11) and a population size of 387 elephants (95\% BCI: 169-621). These estimates were far lower than the population size of 1132 individuals and density of 1.18 per km(2) estimated in 2008. It is unlikely that there has been a steep population decline, as there were no drastic land-use changes between 2008 and 2015, nor were there other identifiable causes for a population decline. Therefore, it appears that the methodological and analytical flaws in the previous estimate are the most plausible reason for this observed difference. Given that the new estimate suggests a much smaller population, it is prudent and precautionary to use the new estimate as the basis for all policy decisions and conservation actions for elephants in Sabah.",Asian elephant; Borneo; density estimation; distance sampling; dung count; dung decay rate; population size; Sabah,2022,2022,2,10.1002/wlb3.01024,0909-6396,11,73,243,1577,8,NA,300,NA,No,325,275,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Apparent resistance to brodifacoum in Rattus rattus in a New Zealand site with no history of anticoagulant-based rodent control,"Context. Anticoagulants have been used in New Zealand for decades, but few data are available on the sustainability of these toxins for rodent control. It is important to regularly monitor for resistance in long-term brodifacoum-use areas and establish a database for future references. Aims. This study aimed to estimate the effective dose (ED50) of brodifacoum for ship rats from an area of New Zealand with no history of brodifacoum use, in order to establish a blood-clotting response test for assessing resistance in rodent populations from other areas. Methods. A ranging study was conducted whereby successive groups of ship rats were administered brodifacoum doses that were increased or decreased progressively, until an International Normalised Ratio (INR) of 3.6 was reached. Linear regression was used to model the relationship between dose and INR, and ED50 dose was estimated using the resulting model. Results. None of the rats appeared susceptible to brodifacoum at previously reported LD50 exposures for this species. The ED(50 )of brodifacoum was estimated to be 2.88 mg/kg for males and 3.81 mg/kg for females. These values are 6-8 times greater than the previously published lethal dose values for ship rats in New Zealand. Conclusions. Blood-clotting inhibition was detected in the rats only following high doses of brodifacoum, which may indicate resistance within the sampled population. Implications. Relatively low susceptibility, or resistance, to brodifacoum in New Zealand ship rats may be mediated by spatial connections between areas with different histories and patterns of anticoagulant rodenticide use.",anticoagulants; blood clotting response test; brodifacoum; effective dose; pest management; Rattus rattus; resistance; rodent control,2023,50,1,10.1071/WR21064,1035-3712,19,127,245,1635,8,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Capture predicates corticosterone responses and a low recapture likelihood in a varanid lizard,"Context. Understanding both the short- and long-term consequences of live animal capture is desirable to limit potential data biases or compromise animal welfare. The short-term elevation of glucocorticoid hormones in animals is an expected short-term stress consequence of trapping and restraint experiences. However, because these hormones also influence behaviour and memory, they may provide a physiological basis through which individuals vary in their recapture responses to subsequent trapping episodes. Aims. This objective of this study was to evaluate the interplay among trapping method, corticosterone responsiveness and recapture likelihood in a lizard, the lace monitor (Varanus varius). The first aim compared how different capture methods and associated restraint durations influenced plasma corticosterone of lace monitors. The second aim evaluated the relationship between capture methodology, corticosterone response and annual recapture frequency. The third aim measured yearly estimates for the probability of lace monitor recapture. Methods. Lace monitors were cage-trapped or noose-captured at 76 sampling sites across three annual sampling periods to measure capture experience, obtain blood samples and estimate recapture probabilities. Results. As expected, an increased restraint time and exposure to different capture methods significantly influenced corticosterone concentrations in lace monitors. Lace monitor recapture rates were meagre, suggesting that irrespective of the capture method, restraint duration and corticosterone levels, any form of initial capture experience typically leads to long-lasting aversive behaviour. Conclusions. Although plasma corticosterone concentrations may be tell-tale of a lace monitor's duration to short-term capture and restraint, they were not associated with the recapture likelihood in subsequent trapping events. Implications. Rapid and seemingly long-lasting trap aversion has apparent implications for the design of population monitoring programs used to study lace monitor population ecology.",adrenocortical responsiveness; capture stressor; lace monitor; learning; live animal trapping; memory; reptile; restraint,2023,50,7,10.1071/WR22013,1035-3712,13,94,273,2068,8,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"Coastal dolphins and marine megafauna in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia: informing conservation management actions in an area under increasing human pressure","Context. Exmouth Gulf is adjacent to the Ningaloo Marine Park, a UNESCO-listed area in Western Australia. The gulf remains largely unprotected, and is under increasing anthropogenic pressure from proposed industrial activities that pose threats to marine megafauna inhabiting the gulf. Threatened and near threatened species, such as the Australian humpback dolphin (Sousa sahulensis) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), reside in the gulf; however, detailed information on their ecology and behaviour is lacking. Aims. The aim was to (1) provide baseline data on the distribution, encounter rate, group size and behaviour of coastal dolphins over an area where current industrial developments are proposed, and (2) report on the occurrence of other marine megafauna within this area. Methods. Boat-based photo-identification surveys were conducted on the western coastline of Exmouth Gulf along predetermined line transects (150 km(2)) over austral autumn/winter 2021. Key results. Across 809.35 km of surveyed waters (181 h), a total of 93 bottlenose dolphin, 15 humpback dolphin, and six interspecific dolphin groups were sighted. Bottlenose dolphin groups were encountered at a rate of 0.077/km, humpback dolphin groups at 0.015/km and interspecific dolphin groups at 0.005/km. Dolphins were predominantly recorded in shallow (mean 10 m) and warm (mean 21 degrees C) waters, and were commonly travelling and foraging. In total, 199 individual bottlenose dolphins and 48 humpback dolphins were photo-identified (excluding calves). There were 30 bottlenose dolphin calves (including three newborns) and four humpback dolphin calves (including two newborns) identified. Other marine megafauna group sightings included humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae; n=32), southern right whales (Eubalaena australis, n=1), dugongs (Dugong dugon, n=25), turtles (n=54), sea snakes (n=27), manta rays (Mobula alfredi, n=13) and sharks (n=2).

WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Comparison of morphological identification and DNA metabarcoding for dietary analysis of faeces from a subtropical lizard,"Context. The common methods for detecting prey in faeces are traditional morphological examination of digested prey remains and faecal DNA (fDNA) metabarcoding. Although recent studies have shown that fDNA metabarcoding can identify prey that is excreted without morphologically identifiable remains, it is unclear whether fDNA metabarcoding provides a more comprehensive assessment of diet than morphological analyses. Aims. We aimed to compare prey detection abilities of morphological and fDNA-metabarcoding assays by evaluating similarities and differences of estimated prey communities. We also aimed to provide the first comprehensive prey composition of an endangered ground-dwelling gecko, Goniurosaurus kuroiwae, which will contribute to the conservation management of this species. Methods. We identified the prey consumed by G. kuroiwae by morphological examination and fDNA metabarcoding using the same series of faecal samples. For these two methods, we compared the overall community composition of prey items and the detection rate for each prey type. We also tested for environmental and ontogenetic variation of the composition of prey items consumed. Key results. When comparing the two methods there were significant differences in the composition of prey communities that were identified from the same series of faecal samples. The fDNA metabarcoding analyses showed the higher rate of detection of earthworms, amphipods and coleopteran and lepidopteran larvae, which lack hard exoskeleton or have small body sizes. The morphological assay allowed identification of a few prey types, including spiders and earwigs, more frequently than fDNA metabarcoding. Combined use of both methods revealed that G. kuroiwae consumed large-sized invertebrates with a slight ontogenetic shift from small-sized invertebrates to large-sized ones. Conclusions. Although fDNA metabarcoding showed the higher overall prey detection rate, it did not include all the prey items detected by morphological analysis. The complementary use of both methods can yield better understanding of the prey composition of invertebrate-consuming animals represented by reptiles and amphibians.",DNA metabarcoding; endangered species; faeces; gecko; Goniurosaurus kuroiwae; invertebrates; morphology; prey identification; Ryukyu Archipelago,2023,50,"3, SI",10.1071/WR22054,1035-3712,16,121,304,2178,9,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Demographic estimates to assess the translocation of a threatened New Zealand amphibian,"Context. Leiopelma archeyi is a threatened New Zealand amphibian species translocated for conservation purposes. A disease outbreak triggered the translocation of 70 frogs to Pureora Forest in 2006 to establish a new wild population of L. archeyi. Ten years after, 60 more frogs were translocated to this site to enhance the genetic and demographic profile of L. archeyi in Pureora Forest. Here, we analysed 14 years of capture-recapture monitoring data collected for this translocated population. Aims. Our aim was to estimate population demographic parameters that allow us to assess the demographic performance of this translocated population. Methods. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR; also called spatial capture-recapture) multi strata/session models to estimate population density and derive its rate of change over time. Key results. Here we show that the density of translocated Leiopelma archeyi in Pureora (central North Island, New Zealand) remains stable for most of the study period. After the release of 70 frogs in 2006, density varied from 0.02 frogs/m(2) in April 2007 to 0.06 frogs/m(2) in December 2014. After the second release of 60 frogs in 2016, density in Pureora of L. archeyi varied from 0.21 frogs/m(2) in November 2016 to 0.63 frogs/m(2) in November 2018. Conclusions. The study species is a long-lived k-selected species, therefore long-term monitoring (>20 years) is required to corroborate demographic indicators. Nevertheless, as the current density estimates are higher than the density estimated for this population after each release (April 2007 and November 2016), we suggest progress towards the establishment of a new wild population of L. archeyi in Pureora Forest.",amphibian conservation; conservation translocation; density estimation; Leiopelma archeyi; Leiopelmatidae; monitoring; population management; spatial capture-recapture; spatially explicit capture-recapture,2023,50,1,10.1071/WR21066,1035-3712,12,87,259,1723,9,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Feral cat GPS tracking and simulation models to improve the conservation management of night parrots,"Context: Night parrots (Pezoporus occidentalis) are one of Australia's most endangered birds, and there is evidence suggesting feral cats (Felis catus) are a major cause of decline. However, because night parrots currently have a restricted distribution, little is known of the ecology of feral cats around their remaining populations. This limits the development of effective management strategies. Aims: The aims of this study were to understand feral cat movement and habitat selection around night parrots, and to then estimate the effectiveness of possible management actions. Methods: Research was conducted around the only confirmed night parrot population in eastern Australia. In 2019 and 2020, we obtained GPS data from nine feral cats, and used step selection functions to assess preferred habitats. Management options were then simulated based on cat movement data, including altering trap numbers and layout, and changing routes for night spotlight shooting (using existing roads, random walking or creating new roads in preferred habitats). Key results: Feral cats preferred alluvial and riparian habitats and avoided rocky woodlands and roads. Simulated control efforts were more successful if traps are placed at `pinch points' where drainage lines converged, and if new roads were created near to creek lines and alluvial habitats. Conclusions: Feral cats move around the last known population of night parrots in eastern Australia, travelling through and using many shared habitats. Targeting creek lines and alluvial areas in cat control operations would improve effectiveness and potentially reduce predation impacts on night parrots.",adaptive management; applied ecology; endangered species; feral cats; invasive species; night parrots; simulation models; wildlife tracking,2023,50,"5, SI",10.1071/WR21123,1035-3712,15,100,243,1654,8,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,"Hot, wet and rare: modelling the occupancy dynamics of the narrowly distributed Dixie Valley toad","Context. Small population sizes and no possibility of metapopulation rescue put narrowly distributed endemic species under elevated risk of extinction from anthropogenic change. Desert spring wetlands host many endemic species that require aquatic habitat and are isolated by the surrounding xeric terrestrial habitat. Aims. We sought to model the occupancy dynamics of the Dixie Valley toad (Anaxyrus williamsi), a recently described species endemic to a small desert spring wetland complex in Nevada, USA. Methods. We divided the species' range into 20 m x 20 m cells and surveyed for Dixie Valley toads at 60 cells during six primary periods from 2018 to 2021, following an occupancy study design. We analysed our survey data by using a multi-state dynamic occupancy model to estimate the probability of adult occurrence, colonisation, site survival, and larval occurrence and the relationship of each to environmental covariates. Key results. The detection probabilities of adult and larval toads were affected by survey length and time of day. Adult Dixie Valley toads were widely distributed, with detections in 75\% of surveyed cells at some point during the 3-year study, whereas larvae were observed only in 20\% of cells during the study. Dixie Valley toad larvae were more likely to occur in cells far from spring heads with a high coverage of surface water, low emergent vegetation cover, and water temperatures between 20 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Adult toads were more likely to occur in cells with a greater coverage of surface water and water depth >10 cm. Cells with more emergent vegetation cover and surface water were more likely to be colonised by adult toads. Conclusions. Our results showed that Dixie Valley toads are highly dependent on surface water in both spring and autumn. Adults and larvae require different environmental conditions, with larvae occurring farther from spring heads and in fewer cells.",Anaxyrus williamsi; aquatic conservation; Bayesian hierarchical model; desert springs; endangered species; geothermal energy; Great Basin; multi-state occupancy model,2023,50,7,10.1071/WR22029,1035-3712,15,97,306,1934,8,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Human influence on burrow activity of the Chinese pangolin in Nepal,"Context. People and wildlife are coming into greater contact worldwide because of the increasing human footprint. Although some species tolerate certain levels of human activities, others are vulnerable to human disturbance, potentially altering their spatial or temporal patterns of activity in response to disturbance by humans. Aims. We evaluated the influence of human activity on burrow activity of the Chinese pangolin, a Critically Endangered species that is heavily persecuted for subsistence and illegal trade. Methods. We deployed remotely triggered camera traps at pangolin burrows located at four sites with contrasting levels of human density and infrastructure in Nepal, and estimated burrow-activity patterns of pangolins by using a kernel-density estimator based on the time stamp of camera trap observations. Key results. Our findings did not suggest that anthropogenic disturbance affected pangolin burrow activity, but we acknowledge that these findings were based on a limited number of observations. Peak pangolin burrow activity was observed after midnight in three of the study sites, including those with highest and lowest levels of human activity. The fourth area, which had intermediate levels of human activity, had an earlier peak in burrow activity, possibly caused by prey deficiency owing to intense agriculture. Conclusions. We suggest that pangolins may tolerate human activity because of their strictly nocturnal temporal niche, but that this tolerance has made them vulnerable to poaching because it allows them to co-exist spatially with humans. Implications. Nocturnal species may be particularly prone to non-conflict-related persecution, because they may be easily accessible targets for illegal hunting activities.",Asia; conservation; human disturbance; mammal; Manis pentadactyla; Nepal; persecution; temporal niche,2023,50,1,10.1071/WR21024,1035-3712,11,67,252,1755,8,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Is the Felixer cat control device safe for marsupial carnivores?,"Context. The Felixer grooming device ('Felixer') is a lethal method of feral cat control designed to be cost-effective and target specific. Aims. This study aims to test the target specificity of the Felixer in Tasmania, with a particular focus on Tasmanian devil and quoll species due to the overlap in size, habitats and behaviour between these native carnivores and feral cats. Methods. Our study deployed Felixer devices set in a non-lethal mode in nine field sites in Tasmania, one field site in New South Wales and two Tasmanian wildlife sanctuaries. Key results. Our study recorded 4376 passes by identifiable vertebrate species including 528 Tasmanian devil passes, 507 spotted-tailed quoll passes and 154 eastern quoll passes. Our data showed that the Felixer can successfully differentiate quoll species from feral cats with spotted-tailed quolls and eastern quolls targeted in 0.19\% and 0\% of passes, respectively. However, Tasmanian devils and common wombats were targeted in 23.10\% and 12\% of passes, respectively, although sample size was low for common wombats (n = 25). Conclusions. The Felixer could not reliably identify Tasmanian devils and possibly common wombats as non-target species. Further data is needed to confirm the potential for impacts on the common wombat and other potential non-target species in Tasmania, and the likelihood of the toxin being ingested by falsely targeted individuals.",feline control; Felis catus; feral cats; grooming trap; lethal control; management; Sarcophilus harrishii; target specificity; Tasmanian carnivores,2023,50,"5, SI",10.1071/WR21175,1035-3712,10,64,218,1423,9,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Mammal use of undercrossings is influenced by openness and proximity to riparian corridors,"Context. A central problem in road ecology is the need to minimise roadkill without exacerbating fragmentation. The best current solution to this problem is wildlife-exclusion fencing combined with crossing structures. However, because species vary in their propensity to use crossing structures, optimising their design for a suite of species remains a challenge. Aims. We investigated medium- and large-mammal use of undercrossings along Highway 101 in the Central Coast of California. Specifically, we quantified how undercrossing size, surrounding habitat, and the presence of a wildlife-exclusion fence, influenced overall species richness, as well as use by black bear, mule deer, puma, and bobcat. Methods. Using wildlife cameras, we documented mammal use at 11 undercrossings in our study area. We calculated the openness index of each undercrossing and remotely measured habitat features, such as percentage tree cover, and distance to nearest stream. We determined the relative importance of these factors on overall species richness, and the activity of focal species, using generalised linear mixed models in an information-theoretic framework. Key results. Mesocarnivores used a wider variety of undercrossings, and used them more frequently, than did larger mammals. Species richness and bear activity were greater closer to streams, and there was more bear activity at undercrossings within the wildlife-exclusion fence zone than outside it. Deer activity was strongly and positively related to undercrossing openness. Our puma and bobcat analyses were uninformative, likely because we detected puma too infrequently, and because bobcats showed little variation in use across sites. Conclusions. Our results support previous research highlighting natural travel corridors (e.g. riparian areas) as important places for wildlife crossings, both for a diversity of medium-large mammals and a low-density large carnivore. Ungulates may be the most selective taxa in respect to undercrossing use. Implications. Large, open undercrossings along natural travel routes accommodate the greatest diversity of medium-large mammal species.",black bear; bobcat; California; connectivity; movement corridor; mule deer; puma; road ecology; wildlife crossing,2023,50,7,10.1071/WR21183,1035-3712,13,90,303,2142,9,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Monitoring methods influence native predator detectability and inferred occupancy responses to introduced carnivore management,"Context. Management actions that suppress introduced predator densities can benefit the population recovery of native species. Nevertheless, ensuring that predator management produces measurable population-level benefits can be influenced by multiple factors affecting species detection. Monitoring designs using multiple survey methods may perform better than increasing sampling effort with single-method protocols. Aims. This study aimed to estimate individual and cumulative detection probabilities and site occupancy estimates from the use of five different monitoring methods to survey a native mesopredator, the lace monitor (Varanus varius). Second, we assessed the effect of lethal red fox (Vulpes vulpes) baiting on lace monitor detection probabilities and site occupancy estimates collected from each monitoring method. Methods. Multi-method sampling for Varanus varius occurred at 76 sites across lethal fox baited and non-baited habitats in East Gippsland, Victoria. Bayesian site occupancy models were used to estimate the effects of detection method and fox-baiting treatments on Varanus varius detection probability and site occupancy. Key results. Method-specific detection probabilities (P = 0.00-0.12) and site occupancy estimates (Psi = 0-0.53) varied considerably among methods, but combinations of multi-method monitoring improved lace monitor detection probability (P = 0.11-0.18) and site occupancy (Psi = 0.87 +/- {[}0.66-0.93]-0.9 I +/- [}0.76-0.97] mean +/- {[}95\% credible intervals]) above any single method. However, there was extreme heterogeneity in the size and direction of the introduced predator baiting effect on method-specific lace monitor detection. Three methods (box traps and two different visual search surveys) all indicated lace monitor detection probabilities increased in fox-baited sites. However, sand pads reported a decrease in lace monitor detection at fox-baited sites, whereas pipe traps obtained no detections. Conclusions. Combining detection data from all methods led to the inference of a positive fox-baiting effect, albeit with a smaller magnitude and better certainty than that estimated using a reduced method monitoring design, which had fewer detection data after excluding biased detection from sand pads.",biodiversity monitoring; detection method evaluation; detection probability; lace monitor; lethal fox baiting; management inference; site occupancy; Varanus varius,2023,50,1,10.1071/WR22012,1035-3712,14,126,311,2272,8,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Nest remains are insufficient to identify predators of waterfowl nests,"Context. Nest predation is a leading cause of nest failure for most ground-nesting birds. Methods that allow for accurate classification of fate and identification of predators are important for understanding productivity and conservation strategies. Past studies have used a visual inspection of nest remains to determine nest fate and predict predator identity. Most formal assessments of these methods have addressed small-bodied birds nesting in trees or shrubs, and have revealed that use of evidence at nests can be relatively accurate for determining nest fate but may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding predator identity. However, few have tested the latter hypothesis for larger ground-nesting birds with precocial young. Aim. We aimed to evaluate a classification system developed for determining nest fate and identifying predators of waterfowl nests, at both the scale of individual nests and across the study area. Methods. From 2016 to 2020, we located 989 blue-winged teal (Spatula discors), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and gadwall (Mareca strepera) nests in central North Dakota. We placed cameras at a subset of 249 nests and recorded evidence of nest remains at depredated nests. Key results. The most common predators were American badgers (Taxidea taxus), followed by striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Using evidence of nest remains, we determined nest fates with high accuracy (98.0\%). However, evidence of nest remains was only sufficient for identifying predators at 50\% of nests, and the classification system was correct only 69.7\% of the time. The predicted proportion of predators across the study area differed between the classification system and our video evidence as well. Conclusions. The accuracy of predator identifications based upon the classification system that we evaluated was not supported at any scale. Implications. Our results suggest that evidence of nest remains can be used to determine nest fate for large-bodied precocial, ground-nesting birds, but accurate identification of nest predators will require alternative methods such as nest cameras.",badger; conservation; grassland; nest camera; Prairie Pothole Region; predation; waterfowl; wetland,2023,50,"3, SI",10.1071/WR22042,1035-3712,10,70,319,2162,8,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Nutritional stress and population density influence risk/reward decisions by elk,"Context: Optimal foraging strategies can be influenced at the group level by population density, which can increase competition, hunger, and activity levels. Optimal foraging can also be influenced at the individual level by personality, which in part governs how individuals assess risk versus reward. Aims: The purpose of this study was to quantify the influence of population density on risk-taking. I focused on captive elk that had previously been studied in tandem with wild elk in order to quantify personality trait characteristics. I hypothesised that risk-taking would be shown to be a density-dependent affect, in addition to varying individually. Methods: Automated cameras recorded visitation to four rotating treatments sites in each of high and low density pens, and which had either: forage, a novel object, forage + novel object, or a control site. Novel objects were regularly changed to elicit a spectrum of responses ranging from neofilia to neophobia. Selection or avoidance of sites was determined by comparing elk visitation to visits to control sites. The experiment was done in summer when natural forage was most abundance, and in again in autumn when natural forage was limited. Key results: High density elk showed year-round selection for all treatment sites. In summer low density elk showed weak selection for forage and forage + novel and no selection for novel objects, and no selection for any site in autumn. These patterns showed that elk in the high density pen, which were in poorer condition, had to increase their levels of both activity and risk taking. Neither elk pen exhibited any group-wide avoidance of novel objects, indicating a group-wide gradient of neophobia to neofilia, known personality traits in elk. Conclusions: These results show that risk-taking behaviour can be a density dependent effect. This increase in neofilia may be driven by hunger stress, but also through increases in competition that may favour elk of certain personalities.",abundance; behaviour; competition; cost-benefit analyses; ethology; human dimensions; social dimensions; stress; wildlife management,2023,50,2,10.1071/WR22040,1035-3712,10,80,312,1995,9,NA,350,8,Yes,375,325,no,yes,yes
WILDLIFE RESEARCH,Reliable detection of low-density Pacific rats by using camera trapping,"Context. Long-term monitoring is essential for control and eradication of invasive mammalian predators. Relative abundance indices are increasingly used when assessing population changes. However, indexing assumes constant detectability, when, in fact, it varies depending on numerous factors, including the type and spacing of monitoring devices, seasons, vegetation types, and inter- and intra-specific interactions. Aims. We studied a population of Pacific rat (Rattus exulans) and examined the influence of vegetation types, seasons and inter-specific interactions on their detection. Methods. We deployed tracking-tunnels, live-traps, chew cards, and trail cameras in three vegetation types during summer and winter. Detection rates of Pacific rats, mice (Mus musculus), stoats (Mustela erminea) and weka (Gallirallus australis) were calculated and compared among vegetation types, seasons and devices. Key results. Pacific rats were not detected by any monitoring devices in the farmland, despite their presence in this habitat. In the forest and shrubland, cameras had the highest detection rate among all of the monitoring devices, whereas live-trap and chew cards failed to detect rats. Tracking tunnels detected Pacific rats only in the shrubland. Camera detections of Pacific rats were lower in winter than in summer, and detections were dominated by weka and stoats for both seasons. The seasonal effects may have reflected the population cycle of Pacific rats.

ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA,"Improved phylogenetic resolution within Neritidae (Gastropoda, Nertimorpha) with implications for the evolution of shell traits and habitat","Neritidae is a species-rich family with substantial interspecific morphological and ecological diversities. The current classification of Neritidae is controversial, particularly regarding the taxonomic position of Smaragdiinae. Although several molecular phylogenetic studies have attempted to clarify the phylogeny of Neritidae, the internal evolutionary relationships have not been completely resolved due to limited sampling. We recently sequenced eight mitochondrial genomes of Neritidae, reassembled five previously published transcriptome data, and reconstructed a comprehensive phylogeny for Neritidae with mitochondrial genome (13 protein-coding genes) datasets of up to 23 species. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference indicated that the Neritidae were divided into two monophyletic groups, Neritinae and Neritininae, with strong support. A representative of Smaragdiinae, Smaragdia rangiana, was found to nest within Neritininae. Within Neritininae, the monophyly of Clithon and Neritina has not been recovered. Ancestral state reconstruction indicated that the most recent common ancestor of the Neritidae was a smooth shell. Our results imply at least two transitions from marine to brackish habitats within Neritidae.",mitogenome; Neritidae; phylogeny; trait evolution,2023,52,1,10.1111/zsc.12567,0300-3256,17,139,164,1264,4,14,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA,Mitochondrial gene rearrangements suggest a new genus in the subfamily Cantharinae (Coleoptera),"The Cephalomalthinus semifumatus species group, referred to as the ``semifumatus{''} group henceforth, is interesting because of its heterogeneous morphology resembling either Cephalomalthinus Pic, 1921 or Rhagonycha Eschscholtz, 1830. To elucidate its phylogenetic status, mitochondrial genomes of four species of the ``semifumatus{''} group, 11 Cephalomalthinus species, and 11 Rhagonycha species were sequenced and examined. All analysed mitogenomes were similar with respect to genome size, nucleotide composition, and AT content. Surprisingly, a rearrangement of the trnW-trnC and trnY genes was detected in the ``semifumatus{''} group, presumably caused by tandem duplication and random loss events. Furthermore, genetic distance analyses showed that the proximity of the ``semifumatus{''} group to Cephalomalthinus and to Rhagonycha was comparable to that between the latter two. Moreover, the produced phylogeny strongly supported the monophyly of the ``semifumatus{''} group, and molecular clock analyses dated its divergence from Cephalomalthinus to 32.52 Ma. Thus, the new genus Amphimorphus gen. nov. is suggested to comprise the ``semifumatus{'' group, in which the observed gene rearrangement was a synapomorphy. Moreover, morphological evidence regarding the unique structure of the aedeagus supported this separation. These results indicate that mitochondrial gene rearrangement provide important phylogenetic implications for revising Cephalomalthinus, a speciose genus that is puzzling in the morphology-based taxonomy.",Amphimorphus gen; nov; gene rearrangement; genetic distance; phylogeny,2023,52,1,10.1111/zsc.12572,0300-3256,12,95,201,1537,5,14,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes
ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA,"Sperm phylogeny of Characidae (Teleostei, Characiformes)","The phylogeny of the very diverse Neotropical fish family Characidae has been the subject of several recent contributions based on morphological characters, molecular data or both in combined analyses. In cases of conflict between these kinds of data, resolution by combined analyses most often tends to agree with the molecular evidence, given the disproportionate number of characters it contains in comparison with morphological datasets. This happens especially after the advent of massive DNA sequencing methods. In this contribution, we present the most comprehensive set of characters from sperm and spermiogenesis of the Characidae. Since these traits are not expected to be functionally correlated with the general morphology or molecular markers, we consider them a third source of data. We provide a phylogenetic analysis from a combined dataset of seven molecular markers (6444 characters), general morphology (520 characters) and reproductive features (94 characters) coded for 165 species of characiform fishes. Parsimony analyses were done under extended implied weighting under 30 different combinations of weighting schemes and strengths. Most parsimonious trees from two different weighting conditions were selected as representative samples of the obtained topologies, in order to evaluate the performance of the reproductive characters. One of these hypotheses is more conservative regarding the currently accepted phylogenies and the other is the most parsimonious tree that we found as the best correlated with the morphological data. Reproductive characters are shown to be more homoplastic than general morphology and DNA, but provided synapomorphies for 23-24 nodes that had no morphological synapomorphies, justifying their use in phylogenetic analyses. Also, in combination with data from general morphology and considering details of the phylogenetic analysis, they showed to have the potential to challenge well-established hypotheses based on molecular data.",Cladistics; ichthyology; morphology; Parsimony; systematics,2023,52,2,10.1111/zsc.12577,0300-3256,6,56,283,1988,5,14,250,NA,No,275,225,yes,no,yes
ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA,"Assessing phenovariant species pairs of moray eels: Hybridization, introgression, and morphology","Phenovariant is a pair of populations or species with distinct phenotypes but little to no genetic divergence, which may have resulted from strong assortative mating, hybridization, or incomplete lineage sorting that changes in the phenotype have exceeded the genotype. Previous studies had mainly tackled this issue on small, colourful reef fishes, but little effort has been made to the barely seen and solitary taxa like the morays (family Muraenidae). In the present study, three species pairs of sympatric morays from Taiwanese waters revealed as phenovariant in the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) were examined from the molecular and morphological perspectives, with three dissimilar scenarios discovered: (1) no hybridization was found between the morphologically most distinct Gymnothorax intesi and Gymnothorax neglectus; (2) Gymnothorax kidako bidirectionally hybridized with Gymnothorax prionodon instead of its closely related species Gymnothorax pseudokidako; and (3) frequently bidirectional hybridization and introgression were detected between Gymnothorax pseudothyrsoideus and Gymnothorax reevesii, a species pair that overlapped in all the morphometric and meristic characters. Nevertheless, the principal component analysis indicated that each species pair has evolved significant morphological divergence, further supporting their taxonomic validities.

ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA,Family-level phylogeny of infraorder Systellognatha (Insecta: Plecoptera) inferred from mitochondrial genomes,"Systellognatha is a monophyletic group within stoneflies containing seven families in two superfamilies. However, the family-level phylogeny within Systellognatha is largely unresolved, with some controversial hypotheses generated by molecular data. In this study, we sequenced one complete and three nearly complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) representing three systellognathan families (including one newly described family), to recover the phylogeny of all seven extant systellognathan families. We tested the effect of heterogeneous sequence divergence within mitogenome sequences on phylogenetic reconstruction. To study incongruent topologies supported by different datasets, we also utilized four-cluster likelihood mapping to elucidate these phylogenetic questions. We found a low degree of compositional heterogeneity in systellognathan mitogenomes. Our results showed that phylogenetic analyses with various datasets under site-homogeneous models failed to recover the Perloidea and Pteronarcyoidea as monophyletic groups. However, Bayesian inference with a site-heterogeneous model (CAT + GTR) recovered Perloidea as monophyletic. Our results confirm a sister-group relationship between Chloroperlidae and Perlodidae. Despite all phylogenetic analyses failed to recover the Pteronarcyoidea as monophyletic, the analyses with site-heterogeneous model based on PCG12, PCG12R and PCGR datasets reconstructed the same relationships among Pteronarcyidae, Peltoperlidae, Styloperlidae and Perloidea.

Here, we describe a new four-layered schmelzmuster in Eomyidae consisting of a three-fold portio interna with longitudinal oriented, uniserial Hunter-Schreger bands and a one-fold portio externa, accounting for a unique enamel microstructure character combination in Rodentia. This new schmelzmuster type has developed early in eomyid evolution and is detectable already in the late Eocene (Chadronian) of North America. In European eomyids, it first occurs in the early Miocene (MN 3), implying that this four-layered schmelzmuster was not present in all members of the family but restricted to species included in Eomyini and some genera currently considered Eomyidae incertae sedis within Eomyidae. Additionally, our analysis recognizes three taxa with schmelzmuster divergent from all other eomyids. Incisor enamel microstructure does not advocate a close phylogenetic relationship of Eomyidae to either fossil or extant Heteromyidae and Geomyidae, nor to fossil Heliscomyidae and Florentiamyidae.

The taxa on Tenerife and Gran Canaria have previously been lumped as a single taxon but differ from each other and from E. rubecula in territorial songs, tic calls, seep calls and wing length. All three species are characterised by moderate to high levels of interspecific mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence (mean 4.2-4.8\%).

ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA,Mitogenomics supports the monophyly of Mysidacea and Peracarida (Malacostraca),"Here, we provide the first complete mitochondrial genomes for two higher taxa of Peracarida, Lophogastrida and Stygiomysida. We examined Lophogaster typicus as a representative of Lophogastrida and Spelaeomysis bottazzii as a representative of Stygiomysida. Both mitogenomes have all typical metazoan genes (13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes and 22 transfer RNAs). The mitogenomes have a length of 15,076 bp in L. typicus and 14,806 bp in S. bottazzii. Gene order differs markedly from the hypothetical pancrustacean/malacostracan ground pattern in both species, and in L. typicus, all genes were encoded on the heavy strand. This is the first time this is described for a crustacean. We also reconstruct eumalacostracan phylogenies using a data set consisting of 98 species based on alignments comprising all protein-encoding genes as well as the protein-encoding genes and the two ribosomal RNAs. We find support for the monophyly of Mysidacea based on species from all three higher taxa (Mysida, Lophogastrida, Stygiomysida).

ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA,Multilocus phylogeny reveals habitat driven cryptic diversity in Ochotona rufescens (Ochotonidae),"Taxonomy of Afghan pikas Ochotona rufescens distributed in Western and Central Asia has long been debated, and the presence of cryptic diversity within the species has been suggested. In this study, we used one mitochondrial (cyt b) and six nuclear (nuDNA) markers to investigate genetic diversity within Afghan pikas O. rufescens populations based on 54 new samples from Western and Central Asia. In total, we included 200 new sequences of mitochondrial cyt b and six nuclear markers from 60 samples. Our results reveal a genetic split within Afghan pikas both in mitochondrial and nuclear markers, estimated to date back to at least 0.58 Mya, suggesting that two cryptic and isolated lineages exist among Afghan pikas in Western and Central Asia. Geographic patterns corresponding to known subspecies were largely corroborated. We hypothesize that during interglacials pikas are forced to track their habitat and move to higher elevations to avoid the desertification of the lowlands, effectively trapping them in refugia at the highest elevations. During glacials, cool climate may have created lowland habitats that pikas could tolerate, potentially allowing them to disperse between mountains. Pikas thus appear to be forced into refugia during the warmer climates of interglacials, rather than enduring ice ages in refugia, like most other organisms discussed in the context of Pleistocene refugia.",Afghan pikas; interglacial refugia; Lagomorpha; mitochondrial DNA; nuclear DNA; Pleistocene; Western Asia,2022,51,6,10.1111/zsc.12564,0300-3256,11,97,214,1404,7,14,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

However, their phylogenetic relationships remain mostly unresolved and their classification unstable. We took advantage of the many mitogenomes published in GenBank to produce a new molecular phylogeny of the neogastropods. We completed the taxon sampling by using an in-house bioinformatic pipeline to retrieve mitochondrial genes from 13 transcriptomes, corresponding to five families not represented in GenBank, for a final dataset of 113 taxa. Because mitogenomic data are prone to reconstruction artefacts, eight different evolutionary models were applied to reconstruct phylogenetic trees with IQTREE, RAxML and MrBayes. If the over-parametrization of some models produced trees with aberrant internal long branches, the global topology of the trees remained stable over models and softwares, and several relationships were revealed or found supported here for the first time. However, even if our dataset encompasses 60\% of the valid families of neogastropods, some key taxa are missing and should be added in the future before proposing a revision of the classification of the neogastropods. Our study also demonstrates that even complex models struggle to satisfactorily handle the evolutionary history of mitogenomes, still leading to long-branch attractions in phylogenetic trees.

ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA,Position of the ammodile and the origin of Gerbillinae (Rodentia): Out of the Horn of Africa?,"Gerbillinae is the second largest subfamily (after Murinae) in the Muridae family comprising similar to 16 genera and more than a hundred species. Phylogenetic relationships among the main taxa of gerbils are still not fully understood. In particular, a major issue is the phylogenetic position of the monotypic genus Ammodillus (endemic to the Horn of Africa), which according to morphological data may be one of the earliest offshoots from the gerbilline stem; however, its precise affiliations have been unknown due to the lack of genetic data. Itere, by means of a multilocus dataset including one mitochondrial and five nuclear markers, we for the first time elucidated phylogenetic placement of Ammodillus and provided the most complete tribal phylogeny of Gerbillinae to date. Phylogenetic reconstructions robustly supported Ammodillus as a sister taxon to all other living gerbillines and suggested that the separation of the ammodile lineage dates back to the Middle/Late Miocene boundary (similar to 11.7 Mya). The results are consistent with subdivision of the subfamily into four tribes: monotypic Ammodillini, Gerbillini (including Taterdlus), Desmodilliscini (including Pachyuromys) and Gerbillurini. In the light of the new data, we discuss possible scenarios of Gerbillinae origin, highlight Ammodillus as a relatively ancient-albeit morphologically advanced-lineage that has never gained diversity and propose the term `ancient singleton' for a taxon with a persistently low diversification rate.",diversification rate; Ethiopia; Miocene; molecular phylogeny; savannah rodent,2022,51,5,10.1111/zsc.12553,0300-3256,16,93,219,1513,5,14,250,NA,No,275,225,no,yes,yes

Now with the appearance of high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, more and more genetic sequence data are available. One of the important sources of genetic data for phylogenetic analyses has been mitochondrial DNA. The limitations of mitochondrial DNA for the study of phylogenetic relationships have been thoroughly explored in the age of single locus phylogenetic studies. Now with the appearance of genomic scale data, increasing number of mitochondrial genomes are available, leading to an increasing number of mitophylogenomic studies. Here, we assemble 47 mitochondrial genomes using whole genome Illumina short reads from representatives of the family Erebidae (Lepidoptera), in order to evaluate the accuracy of mitochondrial genome application in resolving deep phylogenetic relationships.

ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA,"The systematics of Tachymenini (Serpentes, Dipsadidae): An updated classification based on molecular and morphological evidence","Despite the recent advances in the systematics of snakes, the diversity of several Neotropical groups of species remains poorly understood. The lack of studies focused on the phylogenetic relationship within most of the 20 tribes of Dipsadidae precludes a better understanding of the evolution of this diverse family. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Tachymenini, a heterogeneous tribe that comprises 36 viviparous species of dipsadids, grouped in seven genera based on morphological similarities. The tribe is widely distributed throughout South America presenting very distinctive phenotypes, habitats, and behaviours. The phylogenetic relationship among tachymenins is a well-recognized challenge regarding the systematics of the South American dipsadids. The similar morphotype of some generalist species, combined with the very derived morphology of some strict specialists, creates a complexity of traits that has prevented the comprehension of the systematics of the group. To address such a challenge, we combine molecular (six loci) and morphological (70 characters) datasets in an integrative phylogenetic approach. The resultant phylogenetic trees indicate, with strong support, that three of the seven current recognized genera (Tachymenis, Tomodon, and Thamnodynastes) are non-monophyletic and, consequently, we propose a new systematic arrangement for Tachymenini. We revalidate two genera, Dryophylax and Mesotes, and we describe three additional monotypic genera, Apographon gen. n., Tachymenoides gen. n., and Zonateres gen. n. to accommodate Tomodon orestes, Tachymenis affinis, and Thamnodynastes lanei, respectively. We also include Tomodon ocellatus and Pseudotomodon trigonatus in Tachymenis and describe a new genus, Galvarinus gen. n., to accommodate the Tachymenis chilensis species group.
